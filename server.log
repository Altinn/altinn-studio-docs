Hugo provides its own webserver which builds and serves the site.
While hugo server is high performance, it is a webserver with limited options.

The `hugo server` command will by default write and serve files from disk, but
you can render to memory by using the `--renderToMemory` flag. This can be
faster in some cases, but it will consume more memory.

By default hugo will also watch your files for any changes you make and
automatically rebuild the site. It will then live reload any open browser pages
and push the latest content to them. As most Hugo sites are built in a fraction
of a second, you will be able to save and see your changes nearly instantly.

  hugo server [command] [flags]

Aliases:
  server, serve

  trust       Install the local CA in the system trust store

- API for system providers in connection with system users

Description of how service owners' systems can use Maskinporten to access APIs.

## Collaboration Portal

In [My Profile](https://minside-samarbeid.digdir.no) in the [Collaboration Portal](https://samarbeid.digdir.no/), you have access to self-service for [Maskinporten](https://samarbeid.digdir.no/maskinporten/maskinporten/25), where you can create new integrations (clients).

- https://tt02.altinn.no is the test environment for apps in Altinn, and it is connected to the **Ver 2** environment in Maskinporten.
- https://www.altinn.no is connected to **Production**.

## Access as a service owner

To retrieve data from Storage in Altinn 3 via API as a service owner, you must create an integration (client) in Maskinporten with the necessary scopes.

The following scopes are created by Altinn and delegated to the service owner. These scopes are necessary to use the APIs related to instances as a service owner:

```js
altinn: serviceowner / instances.read;
altinn: serviceowner / instances.write;
```

Clients with _write_ scope can, among other things, instantiate apps on behalf of users via the app's own API, upload data, update metadata, and process status.
Clients with _read_ scope can only read data, metadata, and events.

In most cases, a client for the service owner will need both scopes.

Client creation can be done via API or in the Collaboration Portal.

```http
POST https://integrasjon.difi.no/clients/
{
    "integration_type": "maskinporten",
    "client_name": "DIHE test client for instances",
    "client_type": "CONFIDENTIAL",
    "description": "Client to retrieve data from my apps",
    "scopes": [ "altinn:serviceowner/instances.read", "altinn:serviceowner/instances.write" ],
    "token_reference": "SELF_CONTAINED"
}
```

## Exchange to Altinn token

Altinn does not accept Maskinporten tokens directly. These must be exchanged for Altinn tokens. See details in the scenario below.

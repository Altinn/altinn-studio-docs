## Create User & Organization

To access resource administration in Altinn Studio, you need to have a user account.

See this [guide]({{< relref "/altinn-studio/v8/getting-started/create-user/" >}})

## Create the Resource Admin Repository for the Organization

To enable resource administration, your organization needs a specific repository named {org}-resources. This repository will serve as a centralized hub for managing your resources. For example, [skd-resources](https://altinn.studio/repos/skd/skd-resources) .

You can create this repository from the organization page in the Gitea section of Altinn Studio.

- Resources Group that can be assignet to {org}-resources
- Resources-Publish-PROD - Right to publish to production
- Resources-Publish-TT02: Team with rights to publish to TT02

Teams are created from the organization page in the Gitea section of Altinn Studio.

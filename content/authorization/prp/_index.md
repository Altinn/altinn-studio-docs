The rules are defined as a XACML 3.0 Policy document.

For delegated rights Altinn II will provide the delegated policy.

See [Policy Adminstration Point](../pap) for details about how the policies are created.

See [construction components](/technology/architecture/components/application/construction/altinn-platform/authorization/accesscontrol/#policy-retrieval-point---prp) how PRP is built.

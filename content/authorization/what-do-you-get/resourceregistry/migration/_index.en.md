In the resource registry, you can create entirely new resources or base resources on Altinn 2 linked services.

{{% notice warning %}}
Altinn 2 linked services where Altinn offers startup control will not be continued.

This means that those who currently use startup control must implement this in their own solutions and link the user directly to their solution, for example from the Altinn service catalog.

### Import from Altinn 2 Linked Services

If you have existing linked services in Altinn 2 used for external authorization, they must be moved to the resource registry in the Altinn 3 platform.

In Altinn Studio, you can choose to create new resources based on existing linked services.

**This function is essential if you want to migrate existing delegations for an existing Altinn 2 service so that they also apply to the new resource in Altinn 3.**

Select "Import Resource".

![Migration](/en/authorization/what-do-you-get/resourceregistry/migration/migrationstep1.png "Migration")

Provide the ID to be used in the Altinn resource registry. This ID will be central.

![Migration](/en/authorization/what-do-you-get/resourceregistry/migration/migrationstep2.png "Migration")

When you click "Import", a new resource is created in Altinn Studio in the organization's repository.

Since the resource registry requires more complete data than was possible to set in Altinn 2, you must fill in additional values:

- Title in Bokmål, Nynorsk, and English
- Delegation text in Bokmål, Nynorsk, and English
- Description in Bokmål, Nynorsk, and English
- Contact information for the service (can be displayed in the service catalog)

#### Access Rules

Upon import, access rules similar to those in Altinn 2 are created.

Relevant access packages should also be added to prepare the service for transition to access packages from Altinn roles.

{{% notice warning %}}
For delegation migration to work, it is important that the policy contains the rules that exist in Altinn 2. For example, you cannot remove the signing rule if it was part of the service in Altinn 2.

#### Publishing

When the resource properties are complete, it can be published to the test environment or production.

#### Changing API Integration

To perform access control on users in external services, the service owner must make calls to Altinn access control (PDP) to check access. This is done via an API based on the XACML standard.

The request contains:

- Information about who wants to perform the request
- What type of resource it is and who is the party for that resource
- What operation the end user wants to perform

In a request, you can ask about several things simultaneously if needed.

#### Migration of Delegations


For most linked services, there are [active delegations in Altinn 2](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-access-management/issues/579). These are rights granted from one actor to a person or organization.

For these users to continue to have access after transitioning to the resource registry, the rights must be migrated over.

In Altinn Studio, you can start a batch on services created **based on an imported resource from Altinn 2** that:

- Deactivates the Altinn 2 service so that no changes to delegation can be made.
- Copies the delegations to the new resource in Altinn 3.


Currently, this function is hidden behind a feature flag in Altinn Studio.

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('featureFlags', "[\"resourceMigration\"]")
```

Run the command above in the browser console (available via developer tools).

Starting the batch job will take about 10 minutes before the job starts. The first thing the job does is deactivate the service before migrating to Altinn 3.

The service must be migrated to the environment where you will migrate delegations. We strongly recommend testing this in TT02 before running the job in Altinn 3.

After running, the delegations will be transferred. This must currently be checked manually as counting is not yet available.

We hope for feedback from service owners to adjust the process.

##### Creating Reference to Altinn 2 Service

If you have created a resource in the Altinn 3 resource registry without using the import functionality, you can add the reference manually.


This can be done by the following methods:

**Edit Resource File in Gitea**

The format of what needs to be added is as follows:

```json
"resourceReferences": [
    {
        "referenceSource": "Altinn2",
        "reference": "5600",
        "referenceType": "ServiceCode"
    },
    {
        "referenceSource": "Altinn2",
        "reference": "100",
        "referenceType": "ServiceEditionCode"
    },
    {
        "referenceSource": "Altinn2",
        "reference": "https://test.landbruksdirektoratet.no/disko/soker",
        "referenceType": "Uri"
    }
]
```

This can be added by editing the resource in Gitea. Remember to use the correct service codes and URL.

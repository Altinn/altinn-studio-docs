During deployment of an app the rules for the app is added to the Altinn Storage.  
The rules are defined as a XACML 3.0 Policy document.

For delegated rights Altinn II will provide the delegated policy.

See [Policy Adminstration Point]({{< relref "/authorization/what-do-you-get/accessmanagement/pap" >}}) for details about how the policies are created.

See [construction components]({{< relref "/authorization/reference/architecture/accesscontrol/#policy-retrieval-point---prp" >}}) how PRP is built.

## Metadata

[MetadataAPI](https://altinn.github.io/docs/api/rest/metadata/)

### Migration strategy

The Metadata API in Altinn 2 shows which services are available in the solution and metadata about them.
In Altinn 3 the concept of "service" will be replaced by the concept of "resources" and the resources will be available in a [Resource Administration](/en/authorization/what-do-you-get/resourceadministration/).

#### What are the consequences for consumers

This API will remain available, but as services are migrated from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3 you will need to adopt equivalent, new APIs in Altinn 3.

### Timeline

New API for Resource

### Services and APIs in Altinn 3 that replace the existing API service

The following APIs are available in Altinn 3 to look up metadata about migrated services

- Test: https://platform.tt02.altinn.no/resourceregistry/api/v1/resource/search
- Prod: https://platform.altinn.no/resourceregistry/api/v1/resource/search

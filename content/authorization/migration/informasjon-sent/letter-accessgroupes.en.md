title: Consultation – proposal for new access packages to replace current Altinn 2 roles
linktitle: Access packages consultation
description: Here you find the consultation sent to all service owners regarding the proposal for new access packages to replace current Altinn 2 roles
tags: [migration, plan, authorization]

---

Altinn will replace the roles that provide access to services in Altinn 2 when we move Altinn Authorization to Altinn 3. Instead of roles, there will be various access packages in Altinn 3 consisting of services that belong to a responsibility area. The access packages will function as templates for access managers in an organization, which they can use to give their employees access to a set of services that naturally belong together. Information about what this entails and which access packages we propose can be found [here:](/en/authorization/what-do-you-get/accessgroups/type-accessgroups/)

We are now sending this proposal for new templates for consultation. We particularly want feedback on:

1. whether the proposed templates fit the services you have
2. the names at all three levels of the templates

Feedback can be sent by email to servicedesk@altinn.no by August 1, 2023.

The way forward:
When the first version of the new access groups is clarified, service owners must update authorization rules for ALL services that use Altinn as an authorization solution. We expect this must be done in the last quarter of 2023. Guidance material will be developed for this work.

More information about the proposal can be found in the attached documents.

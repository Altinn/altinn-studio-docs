A system user can only be deleted by an end-user system provider. When the deletion is carried out, all associated delegations are automatically removed.

Currently, deleting a system user is only possible via the Altinn portal. The user with the role of access manager in the end-user organization must log in to the portal to perform the deletion. 
The provider cannot delete the system user on behalf of the customer.

For detailed guidance, see [end-user documentation](/nb/authorization/guides/end-user/system-user/delete-system-user/)

### Procedure
1. Log in to the Altinn portal
2. Navigate to: https://am.ui.altinn.no/accessmanagement/ui/systemuser/overview

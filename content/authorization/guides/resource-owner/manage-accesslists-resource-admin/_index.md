## Background

For certain services, restricting access to specific organizations is necessary. In Altinn 2, this was managed via the Service Rights Registry (SRR).

In Altinn 3, this functionality is handled by the Resource Rights Registry (RRR) through Access Lists.

## Prerequistes

- Resource Registry Admin privileges
- Membership in the AccessList group for a specified environment

Refer to [Getting Started with Access Lists ](../../../getting-started/accesslist-admin-studio/) for more information.

## Create new Access List

Navigate to the resource admin dashboard and click on the link for access list administration.

After updating, publish the resource to various environments. Note: If you enable RRR before setting up the list, access will be lost for all.

# Deleting a System User

Only the end-user themselves (with the role 'Access Manager') can delete the system user. When deleted, all associated delegations are automatically removed. As of today, deleting a system user is only possible via the Altinn portal. The user with the role of access manager in the end-user organization must log in to the Altinn portal to perform the deletion. 

## How to Delete a System User

1. Log in to the Altinn portal and open the overview of system accesses: https://am.ui.altinn.no/accessmanagement/ui/systemuser/overview
2. Find and click on the system access to be deleted

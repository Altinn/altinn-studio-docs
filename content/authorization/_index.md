The typical scenario is that some event will be triggered, or data will be read, updated, or created by a digital or analog service. A service owner owns this service and has defined some business rules for who is allowed to use the service.

This service needs to control who can access and modify data.

Altinn Authorization provides the capability to verify and enforce this.

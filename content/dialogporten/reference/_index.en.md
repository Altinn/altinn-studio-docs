See the sections below for detailed technial reference information. The most important resource for you as a developer, either for a end user systems (EUS) provider or for a service owner, is the [REST OpenAPI specifications](/en/dialogporten/reference/./openapi/), as this contains detailed information on a model/field level. 

See [Entities](/en/dialogporten/reference/entities/) for information, sourced from the OpenAPI specification, about the data transfer objects (DTO) that is used in Dialogporten.

## Introduction

All dialogs in Dialogporten must refer to a "resource", which is the entity that defines the "kind" of dialog (message, form service etc), the service owner, authorization policies among other things.

## Basic steps

Resources are administered via the Altinn Studio Designer, or via API. 

Please refer to the guide {{<link "../../../../authorization/guides/resource-owner/create-resource-resource-admin/" title>}} for more information.

## Introduction

Some types of processes consist of several distinct subprocesses/dialogs that cannot easily or appropriately be expressed one and the same dialog, e.g., when there are different dialogs that must be carried out with different service providers and which do not necessarily have to take place sequentially.

All dialogs can refer to a process identifier, which links them together. A process identifier is a rich attribute on the dialog that allows GUI implementations to group/link dialogs that logically belong together. A process identifier contains information about the type of process and the instance ID of this process. It can also refer to a preceding process.

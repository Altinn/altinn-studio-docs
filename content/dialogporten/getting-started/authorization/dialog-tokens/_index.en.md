## Introduction
A dialog token is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) issud by Dialogporten that contains information about the authenticated user/organization, the selected actor, the dialog identifier, date, and other details. 

The dialog token enables a simpler authorization flow for both end-user systems and service providers, as it embeds the authorization decisions Altinn Authorization based on the ID-porten/Maskinporten authenticated identity of the user. Reliance on this token enables the service provider systems to not have to make requests back to Altinn Authorization in order to authorize requests, but can instead rely on the information in the dialogtoken submitted by the end user system, which reduces latency and enables better performance.

## Front channel embeds and write actions

The dialog token is also what enables [front channel embeds](/en/dialogporten/getting-started/authorization/dialog-tokens/../../front-channel-embeds/) and [write actions](/en/dialogporten/getting-started/authorization/dialog-tokens/../../write-actions/), which are point-to-point interactions between the end-users device/system and the service provider systems, avoiding the need for any intermediaries to handle data transfers.

## Security and trust
Dialogporten issues bearer tokens as JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) signed using state-of-the-art cryptography standards. The public key material used to verify tokens issued by Dialogporten is published at a standard HTTPS location, allowing for automatic configuration using most well-established cryptography application libraries.

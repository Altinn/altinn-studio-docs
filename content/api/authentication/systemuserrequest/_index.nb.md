## System User Request API
The system user request api provides api mehtods for the vendor to manage the system user requests.

## Security Scheme
Bearer authentication scheme is used to authenticate the system vendor.
System user request api requires that the system vendor authenticates with a bearer token which is a machineporten token with specific scope.
To get a machineporten token, the vendor must first establish a client in machineporten. You can follow the steps in this [link](https://docs.altinn.studio/authentication/getting-started/maskinportenclient/) to setup a machineporten client.

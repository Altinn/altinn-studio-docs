### Data modeling

As part of Altinn Studio Designer, a new data modeling tool allows application developers to create and modify data models to be used in App or exported as XSD and used in other solutions.

## Altinn Studio Repos

Altinn Studio Repos provides the GIT capability for Altinn Studio with separate repositories for each application or data modeling. 



## Third party tools

Altinn studio stores all code for an application in a GIT repository. The developer can clone the application code to any machine.
The application developer can modify the code in their favorite tools like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). 

The team has created a local platform mock so developers can run apps locally on the dev machine to test and integrate with platform functionality.

## Text editing and translations

Easy and efficient text processing and translation are essential in an app development solution. In addition, the possibility of reusing texts across multiple apps is significant.

Altinn Studio supports any added language, not just languages supported by the Altinn portal.

- Definition of texts using hierarchical and readable keys
- Reusable texts, internal across different pages and on the levels above the solution
- Possibility to add other languages

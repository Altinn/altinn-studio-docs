Storage support storage of structured and unstructured data for apps.
Apps that need the cabability to store data uses the storage service in the Altinn platform to store both metadata and actual data.

## Metadata
Stored in Azure Cosmos Db.

## Formdata and attachments
Stored in Azure Blob Storage. One storage account for each application owner.

### DataType

The DataType model represents data requirements for an application for different process tasks.

| Property            | Type             | Description                                                                                                                                                |

#### Example

```json
{
    "id": "receipt",
    "allowedContentTypes": ["image/jpeg", "image/png"],
    "taskId": "Task_1",
    "appLogic": null,
    "maxSize": 20,
    "minCount": 1,
    "maxCount": 3
}
```
In order to complete process task **Task_1** the user must upload at least one image. It can be either a jpg or png below 20 MB. The user is allowed to upload additional 2 images. The application does not have any business logic associated with the data type. 

### ApplicationLogic
The ApplicationLogic model describes the connection between a data type and a corresponding data model in the application. This is required for all data types associated with an XSD or JSON Schema. In most cases it also implies that there is a UI with a form the user can fill in. 

| Property   | Type   | Description                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| autoCreate | bool   | Indicate that the application should automatically create a data item of this type with every new application instance. |
| classRef   | string | Reference to the class definition representing the data model.                                                          |
| schemaRef  | string | Reference to the XSD or JSON schema.                                                                                    |

### Operations

Get a list of all Applications

```http
GET /applications
```

Get metadata about a specific application

```http
GET /applications/{appId}
```

Get application events.

```http
GET /applications/{appId}/events

## InstanceEvent

User actions on an instance trigger instance events such as _created_, _saved_, _submitted, _deleted_, and _undeleted_.
The events are associated with an instance, a user and an instance owner and generated by the application and stored in CosmosDB.

Format of the JSON object stored in the database.

```json
{
    "id":"6dff32bc-0928-4ae8-937c-b362d6941c89",
    "instanceId": "60238/5c6b1a71-2e1f-447a-ae2f-d1807dcffbfb",

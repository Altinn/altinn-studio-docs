## Analysis Enablement Capabilities

### Requirement Capture

Requirements are gathered through:

- issues on Github
- talks with stakeholders using the platform (service owners and others)

For some pilots, we choose to create larger epics on Github to group requirements.

Some example issues are

- [The issue for supporting Sirius App for tax department](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/issues/3747)
- [The issue for supporting NSM POB](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/issues/4731)
  
See [development application components](../../../components/application/nonsolutionspecific/development/)  to get an overview of our tools and applications.

### User story Definition

The DevOps teams or stakeholders define user stories in our GitHub repositories

[See our repositories](/technology/architecture/capabilities/devops/projectmanagement/).

### Requirement Validation

Product owners and architects, and the teams are responsible for validating requirements.

This can be done through clarification on GitHub issues or meetings with stakeholders.

### Requirement Traceability

GitHub keeps a complete history of the different issues.

### Prototypes, Mock-Ups & Storyboarding

The DevOps teams can create prototypes when needed. 

See development application components for tools used.

## Design Enablement Capabilities

### UI Design Enablement

We use Figma to design the UI elements.

We have made a [Figma Library](/altinn-studio/guides/design/prototype/) available for anyone that wants to design apps.

And we have a Storybook Design system where all components are implemented.

See [Altinn Design System V2](https://designsystem.altinn.studio/)

### Data Modeling & Design Capability

The DevOps team has the capability for data modeling and design.

See [development application components](../../../components/application/nonsolutionspecific/development/) to get an overview of our tools and applications.

### Architecture Design Enablement

Architecture design is presented on this site using Markdown and SVG.

### Application Design Enablement

Application design is presented on this site using Markdown and SVG.

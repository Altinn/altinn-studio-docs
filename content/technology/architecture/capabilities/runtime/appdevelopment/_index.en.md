## Code Creation
Altinn Studio lets the application developer create custom code in the Application. 

With help of third party IDE like Visual Studio Code , the developer can create code from local 
development machine.


## Process definition
The process defintion is defined in a BPMN 2.0 file located in the app repository.
To change the process the app developer need to modify the BPNM file manually.

Later Altinn Studio will support creating and updating process through GUI.


## Source control
In Altinn Repository the app developer can check in their source code for the different apps.

##	Processing Capabilities

### BPMN Process Execution
As part of the Application design and build in Altinn Studio the application developer will [define a BPMN Process](../appdevelopment/) for the given App. 

The application framework used in the app template support reading and processing the process file. 

[Read the details about BPMN processing capabilities](process).

The Storage component exposes a REST-API to Altinn Apps.

Storage is mostly used by the app-backend to store information about *instances* and their *data* elements.
It provides a registry of all *applications* metadata, data types and events. It is also intended to be used by organisations and other clients to read data.

Resources: Instance, Application, DataType, ApplicationLogic, InstanceEvent, ApplicationEvent, MessageBoxInstance, ProcessHistory.

## Instance

An application instance is created when a instance owner (reportee) starts a process in an Altinn application.
An instance replaces Altinn2 Message.
An instanceOwner is a person/company that reports information via Altinn.
An appId refers to the application information element which defines the metadata about the application.

C - creation time, U - can be updated

#### InstanceStatus

[Model](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/blob/master/src/Altinn.Platform/Altinn.Platform.Storage/Storage.Interface/Models/InstanceStatus.cs)
The instance status holds data on delete, archive, read, and substate of the instance.
Setting the archive and read state of the instance is handled by the application itself.
By default, both the end user and app owner can set the delete state of an instance.
Only app owner is able to set the substatus of an instance.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ----------- |
| Archived    | DateTime?                                  | Date and time for when the instance was archived. Null if instance is active. |
| SoftDeleted | DateTime?                                  | Date and time for when the instance was soft deleted. Null if instance is not deleted.|
| HardDeleted | DateTime?                                  | Date and time for when the instance was hard deleted. Null if instance is not deleted.|
| ReadStatus  | [ReadStatus](https://tinyurl.com/y2bdhqs7) | An enum reflecting if the instance is unred, read og updated since last review. |
| SubStatus   | [Substatus](https://tinyurl.com/yygqr9px)  | Substatus of the instance. Label & description should be text keys in order to enable language support. |

#### CompleteConfirmation

[Model](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/blob/master/src/Altinn.Platform/Altinn.Platform.Storage/Storage.Interface/Models/CompleteConfirmation.cs)

The complete confirmation is used to inform Altinn about when a given stakeholder considers 
their own process as complete with regards to an instance.

| Attribute     | Type   | Description                                                   |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| StakeholderId | string |  Unique identifier for a stakeholder.                         |
| ConfirmedOn | DateTime |  Date and time for when the complete confirmation was created.|

### Operations

Create a new instance of an app for a given instance owner. 
Post with query params that identifies the appId and the instance owner. 
An instance object can be sent as json data to set certian values.

```http
POST /instances?appId=test/sailor
{ "instanceOwner": { "partyId": "60238" }}
```

Get information about one instance.

```http
GET /instances/{instanceId}
```

Get (query) all instances that an instance owner has

```http
GET /instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}
```

Query all instances of an application owner's organisation

```http
GET /instances?org={org}
```

Delete a specific instance (also deletes its data).

```http
DELETE /instances/{instanceId}
```

Update read status of an instance. UpdatedState can hold values: "read", "unread", "updatedSinceLastReview"

```http
PUT /instances/{instanceId}/readstatus?status={updatedState}
```

Update substatus of an instance.

```http
PUT /instances/{instanceId}/substatus
```

### Data service

A data element is a file that contains a specific form element of an instance.
It may be structured file, e.g. json, xml, or it may be a binary file, e.g. pdf.
The application metadata restricts the types of form elements that are allowed {dataType}.

Get a specific data element

```http
GET /instances/{instanceId}/data/{dataId}
```

Post to create a specific data element. Content a file (as MultipartContent).
After success the instance's data section is updated, with the appropriate dataId guid
that is used to identify the specific data element

```http
POST /instances/{instanceId}/data?dataType={dataType}
```

Put to replace a specific data element. Delete to remove data element.

```http
PUT /instances/{instanceId}/data/{dataId}
```

Notice that PDFs, such as receipts or simmilar, is handled the same way as data elements.

## Application

Application metadata used to validate data element types in instances. And to provide application events.

#### Example

```json
{
    "id": "receipt",
    "allowedContentTypes": ["image/jpeg", "image/png"],
    "taskId": "Task_1",
    "appLogic": null,
    "maxSize": 20,
    "minCount": 1,
    "maxCount": 3
}
```
In order to complete process task **Task_1** the user must upload at least one image. It can be either a jpg or png below 20 MB. The user is allowed to upload additional 2 images. The application does not have any business logic associated with the data type. 

### ApplicationLogic
The ApplicationLogic model describes the connection between a data type and a corresponding data model in the application. This is required for all data types associated with an XSD or JSON Schema. In most cases it also implies that there is a UI with a form the user can fill in. 

| Property   | Type   | Description                                                                                                             |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Operations

Get a list of all Applications

```http
GET /applications
```

Get metadata about a specific application

```http
GET /applications/{appId}
```

Get application events.

```http
GET /applications/{appId}/events
```

## InstanceEvent

User actions on an instance trigger instance events such as _created_, _saved_, _submitted, _deleted_, and _undeleted_.
The events are associated with an instance, a user and an instance owner and generated by the application and stored in CosmosDB.

Format of the JSON object stored in the database.

```json
{
    "id":"6dff32bc-0928-4ae8-937c-b362d6941c89",
    "instanceId": "60238/5c6b1a71-2e1f-447a-ae2f-d1807dcffbfb",
    "eventType": "deleted",
    "created": "2019-05-02T13:08:21.981476Z",

[BPMN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Process_Model_and_Notation) is a standard for business process modeling that provides a graphical notation
for specifying business processes in a Business Process Diagram, based on a flowcharting technique very similar to activity diagrams
from Unified Modeling Language (UML).

- BPMN 2.0 has a standardized XML format for exchanging BPMN 2.0 processes between different parties and software.
- BPMN 2.0 supports defining collaboartion between two or more collaborators.

## BPMN 2.0 XML Extensibility

In the formal specifications chapter 8.2.3 the following is described:

> The BPMN metamodel is aimed to be extensible. This allows BPMN adopters to extend the specified metamodel in a
> way that allows them to be still BPMN-compliant.
>
> It provides a set of extension elements, which allows BPMN adopters to attach additional attributes and elements to
> standard and existing BPMN elements.
>
> This approach results in more interchangeable models, because the standard elements are still intact and can still be
> understood by other BPMN adopters. Itâ€™s only the additional attributes and elements that MAY be lost during interchange.

**When extended the BPMN XML is still understood by other BPMN adopters,
but the additional attributes and elements MAY be lost during interchange.**

- Testing different BPMN software packages shows that the extended attributes in the XML does not show up as configurable properties in other software.
- Modifying the "default template" in the [BeeBPMN editor](https://www.beepmn.com) did not remove the default Altinn properties.

Docker is used as the container technology for hosting [Altinn Studio Designer](/nb/altinn-studio) and [Altinn Studio Repos](/nb/altinn-studio/v8/repos).

In [Altinn Apps](/nb/altinn-studio-apps) it is used to host the different apps created in Altinn Studio as seperate containers.

Altinn ❤️ containers.

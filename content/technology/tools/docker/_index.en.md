Docker is used as the container technology for hosting [Altinn Studio Designer](/en/altinn-studio) and [Altinn Studio Repos](/en/altinn-studio/v8/repos).

In [Altinn Apps](/en/technology/solutions/altinn-apps/) it is used to host the different apps created in Altinn Studio as seperate containers.

Altinn ❤️ containers.

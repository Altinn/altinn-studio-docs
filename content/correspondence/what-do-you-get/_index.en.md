## Summary of advantages of Altinn Correspondence

Altinn Correspondence offers several unique benefits that make it the preferred choice for digital communication with public agencies in Norway:

* Centralized communication: Altinn Correspondence serves as a central hub where all communications with public authorities can be managed from one account. This eliminates the need to manage multiple accounts or platforms.
* Security and confidentiality: Regular email is often not considered secure enough in many contexts. Altinn Correspondence can be used for transferring sensitive information. The platform uses strong authentication and encryption techniques to protect user data.
* Automation of submissions: The system allows for the automation of submissions such as tax returns and annual accounts, saving time and reducing errors.
* Availability: Altinn is available around the clock, allowing users to submit and receive documents at any time, which offers great flexibility compared to traditional postal services with limited hours.
* Integration with other systems: Altinn is designed to easily integrate with other systems in both the private and public sectors, enabling seamless data flow and efficiency.
* Environmentally friendly: By reducing the need for paper-based communication, Altinn contributes to more environmentally friendly administration.

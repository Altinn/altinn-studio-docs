## Many-to-many Brokering

### Concept

Many-to-many transfers with brokering illustrated …

{{< figure src="./image13.png" title="Figure 13: ..." alt="Alt-text">}} 

Anticipated use cases:

1.  Case management: The Case Folder is maintained across one or more
    providers.

2.  

Husk, Erik:

- Pub-sub vs. content based routing vs. specific addressing
- Authorization of events

### Scenarios – sequence diagrams
TBDs

### Solution outline
The solution will build on the solution for basic managed file
transfers.

### Further details
TBD

## Case Folders
Files may be correlated to form virtual case folders, possibly with multiple
providers and consumers collaborating on a common case or end-to-end
process crossing organization boundaries (seamless services).

## What is Altinn Correspondence?
Altinn Correspondence enables the secure exchange of correspondence,
such as official letters, notifications, and other documents,
between public agencies and individuals or businesses.

The goal of Altinn Correspondence is to streamline and improve the efficiency of
communication between the government and the public,
ensuring that important information is delivered securely and can be accessed conveniently online.

The service is part of the broader Altinn platform, which aims to digitize and simplify processes related to public services and administration in Norway.

## What are the advantages of Altinn Messaging compared to other alternatives?
Altinn Messaging offers several unique benefits that make it the preferred choice for digital communication with public agencies in Norway:

* Centralized communication: Altinn Messaging serves as a central hub where all communications with public authorities can be managed from one account. This eliminates the need to manage multiple accounts or platforms.
* Security and confidentiality: Regular email is often not considered secure enough in many contexts. Altinn Messaging can be used for transferring sensitive information. The platform uses strong authentication and encryption techniques to protect user data.
* Automation of submissions: The system allows for the automation of submissions such as tax returns and annual accounts, saving time and reducing errors.
* Availability: Altinn is available around the clock, allowing users to submit and receive documents at any time, which offers great flexibility compared to traditional postal services with limited hours.
* Integration with other systems: Altinn is designed to easily integrate with other systems in both the private and public sectors, enabling seamless data flow and efficiency.
* Environmentally friendly: By reducing the need for paper-based communication, Altinn contributes to more environmentally friendly administration.

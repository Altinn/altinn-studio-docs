## What is Altinn Correspondence?
Altinn Correspondence enables the secure exchange of correspondence, 
such as official letters, notifications, and other documents, 
between public agencies and individuals or businesses. 

The goal of Altinn Correspondence is to streamline and improve the efficiency of 
communication between the government and the public, 
ensuring that important information is delivered securely and can be accessed conveniently online.

The service is part of the broader Altinn platform, which aims to digitize and simplify processes related to public services and administration in Norway. 

The basic use case supported by Altinn 3 Correspondence is 1:1 messaging from one sender to one recipent.

Due to the different distinct roles an enterprise may have in their interaction with Altinn Correspondence, we have divided our guides based on the specific role;

- Sender
- Recipient
- Service Owner

An enterprise may have one, or a combination of all three roles according to the context.

**Service owners** own the configuration and data storage for the Correspondence Service Resource, and will maintain access rights for their specific resource in Altinn Resource Rights Registry.

Most enterprises will have *Sender* and/or *Recipient*, while *Service owners* frequently will have all three.

As a **Service owner**, you are responsible for configuring the service as well as data storage and access management of the service. This means that you as a service owner need to set up and configure the solution before it can be taken into use.

An enterprise may have three different roles when interacting with Altinn Correspondence;

- sender
- recipient
- service Owner

An enterprise may have one, or a combination of all three roles according to the context. Most enterprises will have *Sender* and/or *Recipient*, while *Service owners* frequently will have all three.
As a **Service owner**, you are responsible for configuring the service and access management of the service. This means that you as a service owner need to set up and configure the solution before it can be taken into use. 


## 1. Get started as service owner in Altinn {#get-started-as-service-owner-in-altinn}

To get started with Altinn Correspondence, your enterprise must be registered as a service owner in Altinn. For a step-by-step guide , see the
[Get started with Altinn guide (Norwegian language only)](https://www.altinndigital.no/kom-i-gang/guide-kom-i-gang-med-altinn/).

This step is only necessary for new enterprises that have not yet established themselves as service owners on the Altinn platform. As an existing service owner, you can proceed directly with the next steps to start using Altinn Correspondence.

## 2. Create or get access to a resource in Altinn Resource Registry {#register-a-resource-in-altinn-resource-registry}
In order to send messages via Altinn Correspondence, they must first be associated with a resource. 
A resource represents a specific function or set of functions used to manage access and rules for the correspondence. Resources are registered via Altinn Studio and are used to define access rules and access lists, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

### 2a. Create a new resource as a service owner
If you are a service owner you need to create a resource and follow the steps below:
1. Log in to Altinn Studio and navigate to the resource dashboard, See [Resource Registry](../../authorization/guides/create-resource-resource-admin/) for a detailed guide.
2. Create a new resource, follow the guide and fill in the necessary information and details about the service.
3. Set policy rules for the resource. Your policy must be configured in such a way that that they permit the actions:
    - "read" meant for recipients to open and read a message
    - "write" meant for senders to send a message
    - "subscribe" to register event subscriptions in Altinn Events

Here is an [example policy](ExamplePolicy.xml).

Note that this example policy sets a required user role "DAGL" for the user that has access to the resource, and requires the use of [Resource Rights Registry](../../authorization/what-do-you-get/resourceregistry/rrr/) to grant access to specific organisations.
A user with that access can then delegate the access to the enterprise user / system user

**TIP**: Verify your configurations using the [Postman collection](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-correspondence/blob/main/altinn-correspondence-postman-collection.json), substituting the test tokens with your own Altinn tokens (See "Login to Maskinporten (Initialize)" request in Authenticator folder).

### 2b. Get access to a resouce for non service owners
If you are not a service owner, contact the Service owner for the Correspondence Resource and ask for access to the Resource, supplying them with:
- Organization number you will represent
- System user

## 3. Get an Altinn API Key {#get-an-altinn-api-key}

In order to use any Altinn APIs, you need a API-key for the APIs, you can get it by contacting us at [Altinn@Slack#produkt-melding](https://join.slack.com/t/altinn/shared_invite/zt-7c77c9si-ZnMFwGNtab1aFdC6H_vwog).
This is passed as the header `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` in every request.


## 4. Register your Maskinporten Client with correct scopes {#register-your-maskinporten-client-with-correct-scopes}

Register your Maskinporten client(s) to authenticate with the Correspondence API, assigning them the relevant scopes for whether they will be used for sending and/or receiving messages:

- `altinn:correspondence.write` 
- `altinn:correspondence.read` 

These scopes are maintained by Altinn and are required to be authorized for the appropriate API operations, and as such are independent of the access set by Service Owners in step 2 for the specific Correspondence Service Resource.

Use Samarbeidsportalen self-service for registration. [Here's a detailed guide](https://docs.digdir.no/docs/Maskinporten/maskinporten_sjolvbetjening_web#selvbetjening-som-api-konsument).

- [Production environment](https://sjolvbetjening.samarbeid.digdir.no/)

## 5. Authentication {#authentication}

For all operations you will need to Authenticate using your Maskinporten Client 
then [acquire an Altinn Token from Altinn Authentication](https://docs.altinn.studio/authentication/reference/architecture/accesstoken/).

## 6. Integrate against Correspondence API {#integrate-against-correspondence-api}

Since Altinn Correspondence is open source, you can access our code in [our public github repo](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-correspondence) and build a local docker instance to test against.

We also welcome contributions to the solution.

See the [readme file at github](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-correspondence/blob/main/README.md) for an introduction to Altinn 3 Correspondenec, and how to build and run it in your dev environment.

The Repo also contains a [PostMan collection](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-correspondence/blob/main/altinn-correspondence-postman-collection.json) with examples.

Swagger for the correspondence API is hosted [here](/api/correspondence/spec/).

## 7. Set up Event Subscriptions {#set-up-event-subscriptions}

In order to use events/webhooks for a Correspondence resource, you need to setup a subscription for the given resource.

See the [developer guide](./developer-guides/events) for detailed instruction.

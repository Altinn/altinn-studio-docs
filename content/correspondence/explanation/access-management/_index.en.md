## Access Management for Correspondence

Our solution allows you to control the access to attachments in a Correspondence. In some cases, the person responsible for distributing incoming mail within the organization should not be able to view the attachment. A typical example is when the Police send their Correspondence "Straffesaksforsendelse".

The organization can grant access to the Correspondence to the person responsible for distributing it to the appropriate caseworkers, but without giving them access to read the attachment.

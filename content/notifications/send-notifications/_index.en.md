description: "As a service owner or internal Altinn system one can send notifications to people in organisations
based on roles or to people. The contact point for the recipient does not need to be known, as the Notification 
component has access to a wide range or registries to retrieve contact information given an organisation number
or a national identity number."

## Combining notification channels

To be completed and considered. EmailPreferred, SMSPreferred. 

## Persistence of sent notifications

- The contents of a notification is persisted for XX years and will then be deleted. 
- Metadata related to a notification, who sent it, who received it, what time it was sent, 
and send status is persisted for XX years. 

## Configure sender info 

Default sender on an SMS is _Altinn_ and default from address for an email
is _noreply@altinn.no_. 

If you wish to give the end user an impression that the notification comes 
directly from your organization rather than via Altinn, you can register a short name (max 10 chars) 
which can be used as the sender of SMSs notifications. As well as set up one or more e-mails to use 
as the from address when sending an email notification. 


## Registries used for recipient addresses

When sending a notification to an organisation or person based on a national identification number
and optionally a role code, the contact information is retrieved from preferences registered in Altinn by the end user, or a 
copy of one of the Norwegian national registries (Folkeregisteret, Kontakt- og reservasjonsregistret
or Enhetsregisteret).

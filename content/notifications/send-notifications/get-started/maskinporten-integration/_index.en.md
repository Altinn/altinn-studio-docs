The scope **altinn:serviceowner/notifications.create** is required for external clients to gain access to the Notifications

Generating a token with the requires scope as a part of the token claims is achieved through Maskinporten. 
Below are guides on how to set up a new Maskinporten integration that can generate tokens with the required scope.

## 1. Get started as service owner in Altinn {#get-started-as-service-owner-in-altinn}

To get started with Altinn Notifications, your enterprise must be registered as a service owner in Altinn. 
For a step-by-step guide, see the [Get started with Altinn guide (Norwegian language only)](https://www.altinndigital.no/kom-i-gang/guide-kom-i-gang-med-altinn/).

This step is only necessary for new enterprises that have not yet established
themselves as service owners on the Altinn platform. As an existing service owner, 
you can proceed directly with the next steps to start using Altinn Notifications.

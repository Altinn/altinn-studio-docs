Altinn Notifications supports sending notifications to recipients identified by national identity or organization numbers.
Recipient contact details and reservation status are checked during order placement and again at the requested send time.

The ordering entity must verify whether notifications were sent, as lookup results are provided in the order response and updated after the requested send time.

### Recipient lookup
{{% notice warning  %}}
The recipient lookup result reflects the contact information available at a specific moment.
If there's a significant delay between ordering and sending a notification, the final lookup may yield different results.
Therefore, always verify the notification's status after the scheduled send time to confirm successful generation, dispatch, and delivery.
{{% /notice %}}


The _recipientLookup_ object indicates the likelihood of Altinn successfully delivering notifications
to the specified recipients. Reviewing this information allows for alternative actions before the send time if recipients are reserved or lack contact details.

### Registries used for lookup

When sending a notification through Altinn, the sender can provide the contact details (email or SMS).
Additionally, Altinn uses a set of registries to retrieve contact details if the sender has not provided them for a recipient.

#### The Contact and Reservation Register (Kontakt- og reservasjonsregisteret)

Altinn maintains a local copy of this register, which can be used to retrieve
name and contact details when the recipient is identified by their national identity number.

#### The Notification Addresses for Businesses (Varslingsadresser for Enheter)

Altinn also maintains a local copy of this register, 
which can be used to retrieve name and contact details when the recipient is identified by their organization number.

#### Altinn user profile

End users can register their preferred contact details for notifications related to organizations
in their Altinn profile. These contact details can be used when the notification recipient is identified by an organization that the user can represent.

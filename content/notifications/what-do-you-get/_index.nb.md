description: "Service owners and internal Altinn systems can send notifications to individuals in a personal capacity 
or a professional capacity through a role they have within an organization. 
The contact point for the recipient does not need to be known, as Altinn has access to a wide range of registries
to retrieve contact information given an organization number or a national identity number."

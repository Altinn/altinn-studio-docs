## Terminology

- #### Notification order

  A _notification order_ is the request to send a notification through one or
  multiple notifications to one or multiple recipients.
  A single order can result in the creation of one or multiple notifications.

  Here is an example of a standard notification order:

  [Insert json of order with 2 recipients]

- #### Notification

  A _notification_ is the one instance of an email or SMS that is sent to a single recipient.

  Here is an example of a notification:

  [Insert json]

- #### Notification channel

  A _notification channel_ is the communication pathways through which Altinn enables you to
  communicate with your end users.

## Notification channels

Currently, we support sending notifications through two channels:

- email
- sms

#### Future improvements

In the future, we plan to extend our notification channel options to provide even more flexibility and convenience.
Our goal is to support a wider range of communication platforms. This expansion will allow both  your organisation 
and the end users to communicate through the channels that best suit the end users preferences and communication habits.

Stay tuned for updates as we continue to enhance our notification capabilities to better serve your needs.

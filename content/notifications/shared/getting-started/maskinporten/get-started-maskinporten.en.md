The scope **altinn:serviceowner/notifications.create** is required for clients to 
access the Notifications API.

All registered service owners have been delegated this scope by Digdir and should 
be able to find it in their list of scopes in Samarbeidsportalen. 

Register your Maskinporten client(s) to authenticate with the Notifications API, assigning them this scope.

[Guides on how to set up a new Maskinporten client is available in our user guide section.](/notifications/guides/maskinporten-client/)

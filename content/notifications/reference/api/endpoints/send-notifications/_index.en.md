## Examples
{{% notice info %}}
In the examples below we have included place holders for both the Platform Access and Altinn token.
__You only need one of them__, reference the [Authentication section](#authentication) for which one applies to your use case.
{{% /notice %}}

### Request
This example demonstrates sending a notification to two recipients, identified by their organization and national identity numbers.
The API first attempts to send an email to each recipient, as email is the preferred communication channel.
If an email address is unavailable for a recipient, the API automatically falls back to sending an SMS to that recipient.

```bash
curl --location 'https://platform.altinn.no/notifications/api/v1/orders' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer [INSERT ALTINN TOKEN]' \
--header 'PlatformAccessToken: [INSERT PLATFORM ACCESS TOKEN]' \
--data-raw '{
    "sendersReference": "9A547448-FDF4-4E60-87AC-C2F652C8353C",
    "emailTemplate": {
        "subject": "A test email from Altinn Notifications",
        "body": "A message to be sent immediately from an org.",
        "content-type": "Plain"
    },
    "smsTemplate": {
        "body": "Demo SMS content"
    },
    "notificationChannel": "emailPreferred",
    "recipients": [
        {"organizationNumber": "311000179"},
        {"nationalIdentityNumber": "11876995923"}
    ],
    "resourceId": "app_ttd_apps-test"
}'
```

### Request using keywords

You can use the following predefined, case-sensitive keywords to dynamically personalize the email body and subject:
- `$recipientName$`: Replaced with the full name of the recipient (supports both individuals and organizations).
- `$recipientNumber$`: Replaced with the organization number for recipients that are organizations. For individuals, this will remain empty.

These same predefined, case-sensitive keywords can also be used for dynamic personalization of the SMS text content.

This example demonstrates sending a customized notification to two recipients, identified by their organization numbers.
The API first attempts to send a customized SMS, as SMS is the preferred communication channel.
If a mobile number is unavailable for any recipient, the API automatically falls back to sending a customized email instead to that recipient.

```bash
curl --location 'https://platform.altinn.no/notifications/api/v1/orders' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer [INSERT ALTINN TOKEN]' \
--header 'PlatformAccessToken: [INSERT PLATFORM ACCESS TOKEN]' \
--data-raw '{
    "sendersReference": "586B753D-9A02-49C8-AC22-2060E3A7862F",
    "emailTemplate": {
        "subject": "Important notification regarding your organization, $recipientName$",
        "body": "Dear $recipientName$, this is an official notification regarding your organization, identified by the organization number $recipientNumber$. Please take the necessary actions.",
        "content-type": "Plain"
    },
    "smsTemplate": {
        "body": "Dear $recipientName$, this is an official notification regarding your organization, identified by the organization number $recipientNumber$. Please take the necessary actions."
    },
    "notificationChannel": "smsPreferred",
    "recipients": [
        {"organizationNumber": "311000179"},
        {"organizationNumber": "312508729"}
    ],
    "resourceId": "app_ttd_apps-test"
}'
```

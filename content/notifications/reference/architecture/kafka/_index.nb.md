## Cluster configuration

The kafka cluster used by Altinn Notifications, is a cluster shared between multiple Altinn components.
Configuration in relation to roles and topic policies are in place to ensure integrity in the data on topics 
owned by the Notifications solution.

 
### Roles

Three roles are defined and used by entities interacting with Kafka from the solution. 

- **NotificationsConsumer**: can consume from topics following the naming patterns _altinn.notifications.*_ and _altinn.platform.*_
- **NotificationsProducer** : can write to topics following the naming patterns _altinn.notifications.*_ and _altinn.platform.*_
- **ClusterAdmin**: can create a new topics following the naming patterns _altinn.notifications.*_ and _altinn.platform.*_


## Topic configuration

### Partitions 
The number of partitions on a topic is set at creation. As our solution has the ability to auto scale, 
we have set the number of partitions equal to the maximum number of nodes available in the AKS cluster
running the consumer microservices. This means the maximum numbers of consumers per consumer group will be equal to
the number of nodes in the cluster.  

### Retention
Retention time varies between the environments. 
For all AT environments retention time for a message is 7 days. 
In YT, TT and production retention time for a message is 365 days.

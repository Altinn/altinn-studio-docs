Azure Application Insights (AI) is an extension of 
[Azure Monitor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/overview) and is what we use in Altinn to provide 
provide Application Performance Monitoring features for apps. 

AI can provide you as an app developer with valuable insights into the health, performance and usage of your app.
With real-time monitoring and performance analytics, developers can identify and resolve issues before they impact the 
user experience. Error tracking and alerts* makes AI a valuable resource during operations as well.

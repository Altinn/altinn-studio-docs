### Radio buttons are picked when:
- you don't have too many choices 
- comparing choices should be easy
- you want the user to consider all alternatives
- the choices are unknown to the user.

### Guidelines
- Radio buttons should always have a connected text, and should never be alone.
- Deactivated radio buttons should be avoided. If an option is unavailable it 
should be removed and the reason why explained in a text. 

### Example of use:

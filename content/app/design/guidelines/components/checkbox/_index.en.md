description: Check boxes are used in cases where the user can mark multiple alternatives in a list of options.
weight: 50

If the user only has one option, use the [radial buttons](../radiobutton/) instead. 

### Guidelines:
- Check boxes should always have a connected text to their right. 
- Deactivated choice boxes should be avoided. If an alternative is unavailable, it should be removed and an explenation should be given in text as to why the option is missing. 

### Example of use:

If the user should only be able to pick one option, use [radio buttons](../radiobutton/) instead.

### Guidelines:
- Check boxes should always have a connected text to their right. 
- Deactivated choice boxes should be avoided. If an alternative is unavailable, it should be removed and an explenation should be given in text as to why the option is missing. 

### Example of use:

### The pull-down list should be used when:
- you have many alternatives (more than 5, but not unlimited)
- you have a recommended choice which is pre-picked
- it isn't important for the user to compare the alternatives
- you don't need the user to read every alternative
- the alternatives are known by the user (birth month, country of origin, etc)

### Example of use:

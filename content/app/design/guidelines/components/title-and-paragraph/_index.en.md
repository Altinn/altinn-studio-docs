description: In most cases, there should be a header (H2) and a paragraph at the start of form pages to summarize the task of the user.
weight: 10

### Guidelines:
- Text length in a paragraph should not fill the module box 100%, as long lines disturb reading flow. 
- Paragraphs should be restricted to a width of 696px, even if the module fills 1056px.
- The text should always be aligned to the left.
- Keep the correct order of the header size levels. Don't skip sizes, but go down by one at a time. This means that changes in text size changes should be between H2/H3, H1/H2, or stay the same. This avoids sharp differences between H1/H3.  

### Example using different text sizes:

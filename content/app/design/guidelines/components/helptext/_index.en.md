You can also use the help text field to explain rules, terms or explain why the information is necessary.

### Guidelines:
- Help texts are placed together with a label or title that needs further explanation. 
- If the content is necessary information to answer the form correctly, **do not** use the helper text, as required information should be placed in an info text in the UI (below the label).

### Example of usage:

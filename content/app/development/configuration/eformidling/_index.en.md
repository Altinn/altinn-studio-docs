## Activate eFormidling integration for your application

{{%notice info%}}
Nuget versions >= 4.22.0 are required for your application to support eFormidling.
[See how to update the nuget references of your application here](/app/maintainance/dependencies/).  
{{% /notice%}}

{{%notice info%}}
In version 7 a change was introduced to ensure that the application knows the delivery status of messages sent through eFormidling and in the case of a failed delivery will log this explicitly. This introduces the need for [inbound event support in the application](/app/development/logic/events)   
{{% /notice%}}

Integration with eFormidling needs to be explicitly activated in the application. 

In the file _appsettings.json_ in the folder _App_, the following must be added to the _AppSettings_ section.

```json
"EnableEFormidling":  true
```

In addition, continuing in the same file, a new section `EFormidlingClientSettings` should be added.
The contents of the code snippet below can be copied in its entirety. 
This sets up the url for the integration point.
The link points to the mock that can be ran locally. 
[Read more about setting up the local mock for the integration point here](#testing-eformidling-integration-locally).

When an application is deployed to TT02 or production,
this value will be substituted to point to the integration point hosted in Altinn Platform.

```json
"EFormidlingClientSettings": {
   "BaseUrl": "http://localhost:9093/api/"
 }
```

In the case you do not wish to test the eFormidling integration when running your app locally, 
you can override this configuration in  _appsettings.Development.json_.

Create the section _AppSettings_, if it does not already exist, and set _EnableEFormidling_ to false.

```json
"AppSettings": {
    "EnableEFormidling": false
}
```
{{<content-version-selector classes="border-box">}}

{{<content-version-container version-label="v4, v5, v6">}}
## Adding support for eFormidling in App.cs

The next step in setting up support of eFormidling , 
is to make the required services available for the application.
All changes are made in _App.cs_, which you fill find in the _App/logic folder.

At the top of the file, among the library references, include the following three lines.

```cs
using Altinn.Common.EFormidlingClient.Models;
using Altinn.Common.EFormidlingClient;
using Altinn.Common.AccessTokenClient.Services;
```

Further, you need to inject services in the constructor of both the class and the base class.

Before making any changes, the constructor should look like the example below, 
but which services are included may vary from application to application.
This shows the most common setup.


```cs
public App(
IAppResources appResourcesService,
(...)
IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor):base(
appResourcesService,
(...)
httpContextAccessor)
```

The list of services in the constructor should be extended with the four services listed below.

```cs
IEFormidlingClient eformidlingClient,
IOptions<AppSettings> appsettings,
IAccessTokenGenerator tokenGenerator,
IOptions<PlatformSettings> platformSettings
```

Further, these services should be forwarded to the base class as well, 
but in this case only include the names, not the types.


```cs
eformidlingClient,
appsettings,
platformSettings,
tokenGenerator
```

Final result should look like this:

```cs
public App(
IAppResources appResourcesService,
(...)
IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor,
IEFormidlingClient eformidlingClient,
IOptions<AppSettings> appsettings,
IAccessTokenGenerator tokenGenerator,
IOptions<PlatformSettings> platformSettings):base(
appResourcesService,
(...)
httpContextAccessor,
eformidlingClient,
appsettings,
platformSettings,
tokenGenerator)
```
{{</content-version-container>}}

{{<content-version-container version-label="v7">}}
eFormidling integration is a part of the Altinn.App.Core nuget package, but is not enabled by default. In order to add support for eFormidling in your application you need to register it's services by adding the following to _Program.cs_:

```csharp
services.AddEFormidlingServices<EFormidlingMetadata, EFormidlingReceivers>(config);
```
{{</content-version-container>}}

{{</content-version-selector>}}

## Configuring key values for eFormidling in your application

Metadata related to the eFormidling shipment is required, 
and this is set up in _applicationmetadata.json_.
You find the file in the _App/config_ folder.

Create a new section `eFormidling` and populate values for the 
parameters defined in the table.

| Id              | Description                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| serviceId       | Id that specifies the shipment type* [DPO](https://samarbeid.digdir.no/eformidling/offentlige-virksomheter-dpo/149), [DPV](https://samarbeid.digdir.no/eformidling/private-virksomheter-dpv/150), [DPI](https://samarbeid.digdir.no/eformidling/innbyggere-dpi/152) or [DPF](https://samarbeid.digdir.no/eformidling/kommunar-dpf/151) |
| dpfShipmentType | The DPF shipment type used for routing in the receiving system                                             |

\* per January 2022 only DPF is supported.

\** available process for each receiver is available at https://platform.altinn.no/eformidling/api/capabilities/{mottaker-orgnummer}


An example of a configuration in application metadata:

```json
"eFormidling": {
    "serviceId": "DPF",
    "dpfShipmentType": "altinn3.skjema",
    "process": "urn:no:difi:profile:arkivmelding:administrasjon:ver1.0",
    "dataTypes": [ "ref-data-as-pdf" ],
    "sendAfterTaskId": "Task_2",
    "receiver": "910075918",
    "standard": "urn:no:difi:arkivmelding:xsd::arkivmelding",
    "type": "arkivmelding",
    "typeVersion": "2.0",
    "securityLevel":  3
}
```

## Shipment metadata generation in the application

The application developer is responsible for creating the message that will follow a shipment through eFormidling.
[Read about the various message types available in eFormidling.](https://docs.digdir.no/eformidling_nm_message.html#meldingstypene)

In versions 4, 5 and 6 this was achieved by including the function below in _App.cs_. While in version 7 this is done by adding a class that implements the `IEFormidlingMetadata` interface which has the same method signature. Remember that in version 7 your implementation need to be registered in _Program.cs_.

Expected output from this function is a tuple containing two elements.
First, the name of the metadata file and then a stream containing the metadata.

```cs
/// <inheritdoc />
public override async Task<(string, Stream)> GenerateEFormidlingMetadata(Instance instance)
{
    Altinn.Common.EFormidlingClient.Models.Arkivmelding arkivmelding = new ();

    // bygg opp arkivmeldingen eller annet metadataobjekt her.

    MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();
    XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Altinn.Common.EFormidlingClient.Models.Arkivmelding));
    serializer.Serialize(stream, arkivmelding);
    stream.Position = 0;
    StreamContent streamContent = new StreamContent(stream);
    streamContent.Headers.ContentType = MediaTypeHeaderValue.Parse("application/xml");
    return await Task.FromResult(("arkivmelding.xml", stream));
}
```

## Dynamically setting the shipment receiver
This functionally can be used whenever the receiver of a shipment is to be determined dynamically.

{{<content-version-selector classes="border-box">}}

{{<content-version-container version-label="v4, v5, v6">}}
In _App.cs_ it is possible to override the method retrieving the receiver from _applicationmetadata.json_.
Three steps are required when defining the receiver in the application logic, 
and all steps are executed in _App.cs_.

1. At the top of the file, a reference to the eFormidling library must be included.  
    ```cs
    using Altinn.Common.EFormidlingClient.Models.SBD;
    ```
2. Include the function below in the class.  
   Expected output from this method is a list containing at least one receiver object.
    ```cs
    public override async Task<List<Receiver>> GetEFormidlingReceivers(Instance instance)
    {
        Identifier identifier = new Identifier
        {
            Authority = "iso6523-actorid-upis"
        };

        // 0192 prefix for all Norwegian organisations.
        identifier.Value = "[INSERT ORGANISATION NUMBER HERE WITH PREFIX `0192:`]" ;

        Receiver receiver = new Receiver { Identifier = identifier };
        return new List<Receiver> { receiver };
    }
    ```
3. Add custom logic to populate _identifier.Value_ in the function.  
   Note that only Norwegian organisations are supported, 
   and that the prefix `0192:` is required before the organisation number.
{{</content-version-container>}}
{{<content-version-container version-label="v7">}}
In version 7 the GetEformidlingReceivers method is moved to the `IEFormidlingReceivers` interface. Create a class that implements this interface and register the implementation in _Program.cs_. Below is a skeleton example for the implementation.
```csharp
public async Task<List<Receiver>> GetEFormidlingReceivers(Instance instance)
{
    Identifier identifier = new Identifier
    {
        Authority = "iso6523-actorid-upis"
    };

    // 0192 prefix for all Norwegian organisations.
    identifier.Value = "[INSERT ORGANISATION NUMBER HERE WITH PREFIX `0192:`]" ;

    Receiver receiver = new Receiver { Identifier = identifier };
    return new List<Receiver> { receiver };
}
```
{{</content-version-container>}}

{{</content-version-selector>}}
## Testing eFormidling integration locally

It is possible to test the eFormidling integration for an application in
your development environment. 
In addition to Altinn's Localtest, and the application, there are two things that need to run: 
1. eFormidling integration point (Integrasjonspunktet)
2. A mock of eFormidling    

### Setup

1. Install the latest version of Java.  
   [Download link and installation guide is available here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/821-0917/inst_jdk_javahome_t/index.html)
2. In the next steps you will be downloading a number of files.
   Define a suitable placement for everything eFormidling related on your local machine and navigate there in your terminal.
3. Clone the eFormidling mock repository with the following command
    ```cmd
    git clone --branch development https://github.com/felleslosninger/efm-mocks.git
    ```
4. [Download the integration point](https://docs.digdir.no/eformidling_download_ip.html).  
   The contents can be places at the same level as the `efm-mocks` folder.
   

#### Running eFormidling locally

1. Open a terminal and navigate to `efm-mocks` (Command prompt or bash is recommended, PowerShell will not work.)
2. Run `docker-compose up -d`
3. Navigate to the folder where the integration point file exists.
4. Run the command `java -Xmx2g -Dspring.profiles.active=mock -jar integrasjonspunkt-2.2.6.jar`
   If you have a newer version of the integration point, the commands last section should be adjusted to reflect this.

This has a known issue that prevents it from running on Docker Desktop on Windows, but works on Mac.

#### Verify that eFormidling is set up correctly

This requires that [node and npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) is present on your machine, 
but they are note required to use the mock.

- Open a terminal and navigate to `efm-mocks/tests/`
- Run `npm i`
- Navigate into the folder `next-move`
- Run `node NextMove.js dpf`
- Verify in a browser at [localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001/) that there are new table entries containing the sent messages.

[Read more about the mock here](https://github.com/felleslosninger/efm-mocks)


## Testing eFormidling integration in a test environment

{{%notice warning%}}
Thorough testing for the eFormidling integration in an application is encouraged.
Safety measures and retry mechanisms are in place to ensure that a shipment 
reaches the receiver when errors are due to weak network connections.
However, invalid shipments, including but not limited to missing attachments or mistakes in the "arkivmelding",
vil cause the shipment to fail without explicit warning the end user or app owner.
{{% /notice%}}

The integration point exposes endpoints that allow you to monitor the status of a shipment in the test environment.

Replace `{instanceGuid}` with the guid of the instance that has been archived.

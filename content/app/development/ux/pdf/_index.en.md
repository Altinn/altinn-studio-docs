{{%notice info%}}

Version 8 uses a completely new PDF generator with a more modern appearance. Most existing apps should work out-of-the-box, with the exception that more types of components are now included, meaning that you may want to exclude more components when migrating to version 8.

{{% /notice%}}

There are two different methods of configuring the generation of PDFs:

1. [Automatically based on your form layouts](#automatic-configuration)
2. [Manually by defining a custom PDF layout (v8 only)](#custom-layout-configuration)

It is also possible to get a [preview](#preview-in-the-browser) of what the PDF will look like in the browser while developing (v8 only).

## Automatic configuration

This method is used by default unless you specify a [custom PDF layout file](#custom-layout-configuration).
This method exctracts all of your pages and components in the order they appear, and displays them in the PDF document.

### Excluding pages and components

Often, you will need to exclude certain pages or components that are not relevant to the PDF document.
This is can be configured in two different ways:

1. By modifying the `Settings.json` file for your layout set.
2. Programmatically by implementing it in code. This allows for dynamic exclusion depending on the form data.

Depending on the version you are using, the programmatic method is set up differently, but the logic is the same. See below how to set this up for the version you are on:
{{<content-version-selector classes="border-box">}}

{{<content-version-container version-label="v4, v5, v6">}}
Modify the `PdfHandler.cs` file under `App/logic/Print`.
{{</content-version-container>}}

{{<content-version-container version-label="v7, v8">}}

1. Create a class that implements the `IPdfFormater` interface found in the `Altinn.App.Core.Features.Pdf` namespace.  
    You can name and place the file in any folder you like within your project, but we suggest you use meaningful namespaces like in any other .Net project.
2. Register you custom implementation in the _Program.cs_ class
    ```C#
    services.AddTransient<IPdfFormater, PdfFormater>();
    ```
    This ensures your custom code is known to the application and that it will be executed.
{{</content-version-container>}}
{{</content-version-selector>}}

{{% expandlarge id="exclude-page" header="Excluding pages" %}}

### 1. Settings.json

Add a list of page names to exclude called `excludeFromPdf` under `pages`:

```json {linenos=false,hl_lines=["3-5"]}
{
"$schema": "https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json",
"pages": {
  "excludeFromPdf": ["page2"]
}
}
```

### 2. Programmatically

```cs
public async Task<LayoutSettings> FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data)
{
  if (data.GetType() == typeof(Skjema))
  {
    layoutSettings.Pages.ExcludeFromPdf.Add("page2");
  }
  return await Task.FromResult(layoutSettings);
}
```
<br>

**Note**: You only need to choose one of the above methods.
{{% /expandlarge %}}

{{% expandlarge id="exclude-component" header="Excluding components" %}}

### 1. Settings.json

Add a list of component ids to exclude called `excludeFromPdf` under `components`:

```json {linenos=false,hl_lines=["3-5"]}
{
  "$schema": "https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json",
  "components": {
    "excludeFromPdf": ["image-component-id"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Programmatically

```cs
public async Task<LayoutSettings> FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data)
{
  if (data.GetType() == typeof(Skjema))
  {
    layoutSettings.Components.ExcludeFromPdf.Add("image-component-id");
  }
  return await Task.FromResult(layoutSettings);
}
```
<br>

**Note**: You only need to choose one of the above methods.
{{% /expandlarge %}}

{{% expandlarge id="exclude-specific-component" header="Excluding components from a specific row in a repeating group" %}}
If you need to exclude one or more components from a specific entry in a repeating group,
this is done by specifying the index of the group element in addition to the component id.

The required format is: `componentId-<groupIndex>`.

### 1. Settings.json

```json {linenos=false,hl_lines=["3-5"]}
{
  "$schema": "https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json",
  "components": {
    "excludeFromPdf": ["ownerId-1"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Programmatically

```cs
public async Task<LayoutSettings> FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data)
{
  if (data.GetType() == typeof(Skjema))
  {
    layoutSettings.Components.ExcludeFromPdf.Add("ownerId-1");
  }
  return await Task.FromResult(layoutSettings);
}
```
<br>

**Note**: You only need to choose one of the above methods.

## Custom layout configuration

{{%notice info%}}

This method is only available in version 8.

{{% /notice%}}

This method lets you fully customize the generated PDF by using a layout file to specify what it should contain.

To use this method you need to create a new layout file for the PDF and set `pdfLayoutName` in `Settings.json` to point to that file:
```json {linenos=false,hl_lines=["3-5"]}
{
  "$schema": "https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json",
  "pages": {
    "pdfLayoutName": "myPdfLayout"
  }
}
```

This layout file is configured in exactly the same way as any other layout file, except that not all component types are allowed. The component types that can be used for a PDF layout file are the following:

- `Summary`
- `Group`
- `InstanceInformation`
- `Header`
- `Paragraph`
- `Image`
- `Panel`

{{% expandlarge id="include-instance-information" header="Including instance information" %}}

The automatic layout includes a front page with instance information like sender, receiver, date sent, and reference number. This information should also be included in your custom layout. The example below shows how to include this information in exactly same way as in the automatic method:

```json {linenos=false,hl_lines=["5-17"]}
{
  "$schema": "https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json",
  "data": {
    "layout": [
      {
        "id": "pdf-instance",
        "type": "InstanceInformation",
        "elements": {
        "dateSent": true,
        "sender": true,
        "receiver": true,
        "referenceNumber": true
        },
        "pageBreak": {
          "breakAfter": true
        }
      }
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

{{% /expandlarge %}}

{{% expandlarge id="adding-page-breaks" header="Adding page breaks" %}}

You can specify that a component should start on a new page or that a page break should occur immediately following a component using the `pageBreak` property. This property can be applied to any component. In the example below it is applied to a header to have a different section start on a new page:

```json {linenos=false,hl_lines=["9-12"]}
{
    "id": "pdf-header",
    "type": "Header",
    "textResourceBindings": {
      "title": "This is a new section"
    },
    "dataModelBindings": {},
    "size": "L",
    "pageBreak": {
      "breakBefore": true,
      "breakAfter": false
    }
}
```

**Note**: The value of `breakBefore` and `breakAfter` can either be `true`/`false` or an [expression](/app/development/logic/expressions/).
{{% /expandlarge %}}

{{% expandlarge id="exclude-components-from-groups" header="Exclude child components from groups" %}}

It is possible to exclude child components from a group by using the `excludedChildren` property on a `Summary` component pointing to a `Group` component. This is done by adding the child component id to the list of excluded components like in the following example:

```json {linenos=false,hl_lines=["6"]}
{
    "id": "pdf-group-summary",
    "type": "Summary",
    "componentRef": "some-group-component",
    "pageRef": "Form",
    "excludedChildren": ["some-child-component"]
},
```

## Preview in the browser

{{%notice info%}}

This feature only applies to version 8.

{{% /notice%}}

It is possible to get a preview of what the generated PDF will look like in the browser while you are developing. Follow the instructions below:

1. **Important**: Use Google Chrome when previewing the PDF.<br>The PDF generator uses a version of Chrome to generate the PDF, and other browsers will therefore not look correct when previewing.
2. Start a new instance in your app and fill out as much as you want.
3. When you are ready to preview, add `?pdf=1` to the end of the url in the browser and hit enter.
4. You should now see a different looking page with all of your components displyed as summary-components; this is the basis for the PDF-generation. Please note that there is some print specific styling that is only applied when the browser is in print mode, so this view will not look exactly like the PDF document.
5. Use Chrome's built in print function. (`Ctrl+P`/`âŒ˜+P`) to get a preview of what the final PDF document will look like.

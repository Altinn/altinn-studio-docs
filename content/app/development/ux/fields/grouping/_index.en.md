Fields can be grouped in a form. This is useful when you have a multiple fields and want to group them logically.
A simple group of fields will look like individual fields visually, but the whole group can be treated as one when
using [dynamics to show or hide fields](../../../logic/expressions), and when setting
up [a Summary](../../pages/summary) you can reference an entire group of fields instead of each field individually. 

Groups get really powerful when you configure a group to be a [repeating group](repeating). This allows you to
repeat a group of fields multiple times in a form, such as allowing a user to add and remove multiple addresses.

If you want to visually group fields in a form, look into
[placing components side-by-side](../../styling#components-placed-side-by-side-grid), or consider
the [Grid component](../../components/grid).

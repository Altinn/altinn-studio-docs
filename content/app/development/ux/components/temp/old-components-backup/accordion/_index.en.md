Then specify which other components you want to be able to collapse by adding their ID's to the accordion's `children` property.
The following types can be added to an Accordion: 
- `Paragraph`
- `Button`

## Options
- `headingLevel`: The level of the heading element of the `Accordion`. Can be any of the values `2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6`. Defaults to `2`.

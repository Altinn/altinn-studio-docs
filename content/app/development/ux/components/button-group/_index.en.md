You specify which button components to include in the button group by adding their ID's to the button group's `children` property.
The following component types can be added to a button group:

- `Button` (Submit button)
- `NavigationButtons`
- `PrintButton`
- `InstantiationButton`
<!-- - `ActionButton` -->

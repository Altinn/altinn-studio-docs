## Usage

<!-- Brief description of the component and how it is used. -->

### Anatomy

<!-- 

Image/diagram with numbered callouts.
1. Take a screenshot of the basic version of the component with good copy (text).
2. Use the [PowerPoint file](../numbered-callouts-anatomy.pptx) to add numbers to the screenshot
3. Group screenshot and numbering, save as image, and add to documentation
4. Include key with description of callouts below using anatomy-list shortcode (see example for formatting).

Example:

![Example image and alt text anatomy](../image/image-and-alt-text-en.png)

{{% anatomy-list %}}
1. **Image**: Photo, screenshot, illustration, or graphic.
2. **Alternative text**: Used by screen readers and displayed if the image can not be rendered.
{{% /anatomy-list %}}

## Properties

The following is an autogenerated list of the properties available for {{% title %}} based on the component's JSON schema file (linked below).

{{% notice warning %}}
We are currently updating how we implement components, and the list of properties may not be entirely accurate.
{{% /notice %}}

<!-- The `component-props` shortcode automatically generates a list of component properties from the component's json schema.
The component name can be explicitly given as argument (e.g. `component-props "Grid"`).
If no argument is given, the shortcode pulls the component name from 'schemaname' in the frontmatter. 
If the component does not have a JSON schema, comment out the text and shortcode in this section and, if necessary, create a table manually with the most important properties (columns: Property, Type, Description).
-->

{{% component-props %}}

## Configuration

### Add component

You can add a component in [Altinn Studio Designer](/app/getting-started/ui-editor/) by dragging it from the left-side panel to the middle page area.
Selecting the component brings up its configuration panel on the right-hand side.

{{% notice warning %}}
We are currently updating Altinn Studio with more configuration options!
 The documentation is continuously updated, but more settings may be available than described here, and some settings may be in beta.
{{% /notice %}}

<!-- 
Add sections describing the configuration of properties specific for the component.
- Use the below Designer/Code tabs shortcode to display the settings.
- Include screenshots and examples where appropriate.
- If the settings are not available in Altinn Studio, use only the Code tab and add the following shortcode directly under the section heading:
    {{% notice info %}}
    The settings for this property is currently not available in Altinn Studio and must be configured manually.
    {{% /notice %}}
- Add file path or other info within the code-title shortcode (shown at the top of the code block)
- Consider highlighting relevant parts of the code using hl_lines

Shortcode for tabs:

{{<content-version-selector classes="border-box">}}
{{<content-version-container version-label="Altinn Studio Designer">}}

{{</content-version-container>}}

{{<content-version-container version-label="Code">}}

{{< code-title >}}
App/ui/layouts/{page}.json
{{< /code-title >}}

```json{hl_lines=""}
{
  "data": {
    "layout": [
      // component code
    ]
  }
}
```

{{</content-version-container>}}
{{</content-version-selector>}}

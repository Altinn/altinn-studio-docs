<!-- HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE
- Read the comments within each section for guidance.
- Delete comments and content that are not relevant.
- When the documentation is ready for publishing, remove "hidden: true" from the frontmatter.
- If the documentation is complete, remove the warning that it's a work in progress.

COMMON PROPERTIES
Documentation for properties that are common to multiple components is updated in separate files and added via shortcode.
Add documentation: Use the shortcode `property-docs` with pointy brackets and the argument `prop="{propName}"`. `propName` must match the filename (which should correspond to the JSON schema name).
Update/create documentation:
- Files, templates, and instructions are located under components/_common-props-content.
- Images are located under /assets/images/component-settings and are added via a separate shortcode (`image.html`).

EXAMPLES
- See Image, Checkboxes, RadioButtons, and Dropdown for examples.

## Usage

The {{% title %}} component is used to display a list of attachments.
It can be utilized to display attachments uploaded by the user and/or to display PDF attachments generated by the system.
The `dataTypeIds` property allows you to filter and display attachments based on specified data types.
In the examples section below you can see how to display attachments for specific data types, or for all data types.



<!-- Brief description of the component and how it is used. -->

## Properties

The following is an autogenerated list of the properties available for {{% title %}} based on the component's JSON schema file (linked below).

{{% notice warning %}}
We are currently updating how we implement components, and the list of properties may not be entirely accurate.
{{% /notice %}}

<!-- The `component-props` shortcode automatically generates a list of component properties from the component's json schema.
The component name can be explicitly given as argument (e.g. `component-props "Grid"`).
If no argument is given, the shortcode pulls the component name from 'schemaname' in the frontmatter. 
If the component does not have a JSON schema, comment out the text and shortcode in this section and, if necessary, create a table manually with the most important properties (columns: Property, Type, Description).

## Examples

### Example 1: Display Attachments for Specific Data Types

This example illustrates displaying attachments for specific data types. 
In this case, attachments for data types with IDs "attachment1" and "attachment2" are shown.

```json
{
  "component": "AttachmentList",
  "dataTypeIds": ["attachment1", "attachment2"]
}
```

### Example 2: Display Attachments for All Data Types

This example highlights the default behavior, which is to display attachments for all data types while excluding PDF system-generated attachments. 

```json
{
  "component": "AttachmentList",
  "dataTypeIds": [] // Alternatively, this property can be omitted
}
```

### Example 3: Display Attachments for All Data Types (Including PDF System Generated Attachments)

This example demonstrates how to display attachments for all data types, including PDF system-generated attachments.

```json
{
  "component": "AttachmentList",
  "dataTypeIds": ["include-all"]
}
```

### Example 4: Display Attachments for Specific Data Types (Including PDF System Generated Attachments)

This example illustrates how to display attachments for specific data types, including PDF system-generated attachments.

```json
{
  "component": "AttachmentList",
  "dataTypeIds": ["attachment1", "attachment2", "ref-data-as-pdf"]
}
```

### Example 5: Display Attachments for All Data Types in the Current Process/Task

```json
{
  "component": "AttachmentList",
  "dataTypeIds": ["from-task"]
}
```

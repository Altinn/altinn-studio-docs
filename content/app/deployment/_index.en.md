## Getting access to a production environment

Before you can deploy an application to the production environment for the first time, a seperate cluster for the service owner needs to be provisioned.

To get the cluster provisioned, the following process applies:

1. [Send an e-mail](mailto:tjenesteeier@digdir.no) with a message about which apps you have ready for deployment to production.
2. [Confirm that service owner accepts the terms of use](https://digdir.apps.altinn.no/digdir/godkjenn-bruksvilkaar)
3. Wait for a reply that cluster is created.

This routine just needs to be followed once. When the cluster is set up, the solution is 100% self-serviced afterwards.

## Deployment of app

Deploy of an application to production is done in [the same way as for test environments](../testing/deploy).

Sogndal is in need of more young residents and wishes to become a desirable 
municipality for young adults and others who wish to settle down.

That is why they wish to create a service in Altinn aimed at people 
who are moving to Sogndal over the next six months.

By collecting data about newcomers at an early point, the municipality may facilitate 
and customize the services to the newcomers before the first moving box has even been packed.

Sogndal has a few requirements for the services described in the sections below.

## Requirements from the municipality

### Naming
{{% expandlarge id="naming-expandable" header="Requirements" %}}

- The application must have a sensible name that makes it easy to find it again among the large number
of repositories, Sogndal keeps in Altinn Studio.

- There are currently no plans for yearly revisions of the app,
so the year does not need to be taken into account.

There is a wish that one or more of the words "newcomer" and "Sogndal" is included in the name.

### Obtaining previous residences
{{% expandlarge id="residences-expandable" header="Requirements" %}}

To be able to tailor the best possible offers to newcomers we wish to obtain an overview of former residences of the newcomer.

On the data page there should be an option to enter previous residences.
Previous residences should contain following fields:
- Street address
- Postal code
- Postal city

It should be possible to enter up to 10 former residences. 

{{% /expandlarge %}}

### Validation of previous residences
{{% expandlarge id="vendetta-expandable" header="Requirements" %}}

Due to a personal vendetta among one of the employees in the municipality of Sogndal, a user who enters 
postal code `4619` as a previous residence should **NOT** be allowed to move to Sogndal.

In this case, an error message should appear at the field in question with the following text:

```md
Du er ikke velkommen til vår kommune. Beklager!
```

### Data processing of invalid street address
{{% expandlarge id="dataprocessing-expandable" header="Requirements" %}}

There is an address in Sogndal which is often misspelled by newcomers which leads to case workers having to spend a lot of time manually correcting it.
Therefore, we want the app to automatically fix this mistake when the misspelled address is detected.

If the user enters `Sesame Street 1` in the field `Innflytter.Adresse.Gateadresse`, it should automatically be corrected to `Sesamsgate 1`.
For all other addresses the field should remain the same.

### The pull-down list should be used when:
- You have many alternatives (more than 5, but not unlimited)
- You have a recommended choice which is pre-selected
- It isn't important for the user to compare the alternatives
- You don't need the user to read every alternative
- The alternatives are known by the user (birth month, country of origin, etc)

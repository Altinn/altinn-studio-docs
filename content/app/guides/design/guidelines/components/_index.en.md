**Do you need a new component?**

We wish everyone welcome to contribute to the component library through both code and design. 
Practically this means that Altinn wishes to [accept suggestions for new components](/app/community/contributing/propose-component/) as service owners find a need for them.

You are welcome to check the existing components below.

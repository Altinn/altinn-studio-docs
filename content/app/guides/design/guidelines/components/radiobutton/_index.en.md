### Radio buttons are picked when:
- You don't have too many choices (max 7)
- There is no obvious recommended choice
- You want the user to consider and compare all alternatives

### Guidelines
- Radio buttons should always have a connected text, and should never be alone.
- Deactivated radio buttons should be avoided. If an option is unavailable it 
should be removed and the reason why explained in a text. 

### Example of use:

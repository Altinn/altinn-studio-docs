The Altinn prototype-kit is a collection of presets and components that you can use to create a prototype of your app within Figma. 

**With Altinn's Prototype-Kit for Figma you can:**

- See what Altinn-forms look like and how they are experienced by the user
- Familiarize yourself with design elements in Altinn 3
- Define flow and content within your form
- Create clickable sketch that can be user tested
- Use the prototype as a guide/reference while the app is in development

## Get started with Figma
Having a designer that already has experience in Figma or a similar tool would be an advantage. 
If you don't have access to such a resource, 
we recommend going through an [introductory course before you start](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7QHLShNqIXL1Cgbxj7HlN4).

1. Create a user on [https://www.figma.com/](https://www.figma.com/). Figma can be installed locally or be used from your browser.
2. Open the Altinn prototype-kit and follow the steps as described in the introduction on the first page if the file:

When the designer/professional has designed and user tested the form, 
it can be used as a specification for what the developers should create in Altinn Studio.

**NOTE:** If you are creating services for your own solution, where Altinn is invisible for the user, you should rather use 
your agency's own design system to prototype your service.

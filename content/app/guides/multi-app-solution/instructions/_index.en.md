## Prerequisites

Before continue reading the technical implementation details, please make sure the
required prerequisites are met.

### Functional Prerequisites

1. The app-developer must have access to create and develop applications owned by an organization.
2. Existing basic Altinn form where the content of the data model is assessed against the intended data flow between
   application A and application B.
3. Who is the instance owner

Does the end user of application A have the required roles to instantiate application B on behalf of the intended
recipient?

- If yes, no maskinporten integration is required.
- If no, maskinporten integration is required in order for the
  application to impersonate the app owner, with rights to instantiate on behalf of all parties,

### Technical Prerequisites

1. Your applications are using version 8 or newer of the Altinn nugets.
2. Already existing Maskinporten client with the altinn-specific scopes; `altinn:serviceowner/instances.read` and
   `altinn:serviceowner/instances.write`, owned by the organization.*
3. An integration between the application(s) and the clients in Maskinporten. This must be done in the application(s)
   that are going to send requests to another application, which requests needs to be authorized by the application
   owner.*

If step 2 and 3 of the technical requirements are missing see
section [Maskinporten-App Integration](../../maskinporten-app-integration)

\* _If the end user of application A have the required roles to instantiate application B on behalf of the intended
recipient, you can skip these technical requirements_

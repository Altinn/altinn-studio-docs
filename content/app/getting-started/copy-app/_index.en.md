In Altinn Studio you can make a copy of an existing application within an organization. This is done through the dashboard.
In order to do this you have to have permission to create new repositories within your org. Members of the teams "**Owners**" and "**Developers**" have these rights by default.
If you don't have permissions you should talk to your organizations administrator.

1. Click the "..."-icon in the far right table row of the app you want to copy.
2. Press "**Lag kopi**" from the menu
3. Add the **name** you want for the new application. This name is used to identify the application, as well as the repository name, and URLS and API's.
   The name should be short and descriptive, for instance "sick-leave" or "local-election-2019". ![Copy app](copy-app.png "Copy app")
    _The name can not be changed after the application has been published._

Altinn Studio is used to create applications (apps).
An app could be anything form a simple form to a more  complex application with APIs, user interfaces, and everything in between.

You create an app from the dashboard in Altinn Studio.

![Dashboard in Altinn Studio](overview.png "Dashboard - overview")

1. Click on "**ny app**"-button in the top right corner of the dashboard.
2. Select the **eier** of the app. If you don't have access to any organisations, you have to select your self and the app would be created in your "sandbox".
3. Add the **navn** of the app. This name is used to identify the application, and also as the name of the repository, and in URL's and APIs.
   The name should be short and descriptive, for instance "sick-leave" or "local-election-2019".  
    _Name can **not** be changed after an app has been deployed._
4. Create the app by clicking "**Opprett**".

You can create a new model from scratch, which starts with 3 example fields as a basis. Click on a field to open the editing panel,
where you can edit the name, type, constraints, and more. Read [this article](../../../development/data/data-modeling) for 
more information on data modeling.

You can also upload an existing data model (XSD) - it will be converted to JSONSchema for you, and you can continue working on it in the tool.

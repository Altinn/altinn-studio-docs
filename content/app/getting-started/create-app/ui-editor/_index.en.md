The form builder consists of 4 columns (left to right):
1. Components - available form components that can be dragged into the form pages. The components are visible when a page is selected for editing.
2. Pages - The structure of the actual form. Here, you can add/delete pages and switch between them. When a page is selected, the form structure for that page is displayed.
3. Configuration - When you select a component on a page, all configuration options for the component are displayed. This includes both settings applied to the component and dynamics.
4. Preview - Here, you can see a preview of how the selected page will appear to the end-user.

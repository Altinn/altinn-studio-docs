This intro course is divided into six modules and covers a fictitious case for the municipality of Sogndal.
Over the course of these six modules, you will have gone through the main functionality of an Altinn App,
as well as testing the app locally and in a test environment.

Three things have to be in order before you can get started with this course.

1. [A user in Altinn Studio](/app/getting-started/first-time-setup/#lag-en-bruker-i-altinn-studio)
2. [Your local development environment is set up with support for development and testing of apps](https://github.com/Altinn/app-localtest/blob/master/README.md#prerequisites)
3. [Access to an organization with a test environment](/app/getting-started/first-time-setup/#bli-del-av-en-organisasjon)*

\* A prerequisite for module 3. The remaining modules can be completed with full learning benefits without this being set up.

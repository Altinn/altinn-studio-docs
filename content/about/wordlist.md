### Workflow


### XACML
XACML stands for "eXtensible Access Control Markup Language". The standard defines a 
declarative fine-grained, attribute-based access control policy language,[2] an architecture, 
and a processing model describing how to evaluate access requests according to the rules defined in policies.

Altinn Studio Apps uses the XACML standard for defining Policies for apps, the authorization architecture, 
and the request and response between PEP and PDP.

## 1.1 About the Assessment of Data Protection Impacts

As Digdir interprets documents from the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), it often appears necessary to conduct a
Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) when transitioning to the cloud due to «*...the possible sensitive nature and
large amounts of data processed by public bodies...*»[^1]. Therefore, Digdir has chosen to carry out a DPIA due to the
shift from a local operational provider in Norway to an international cloud service provider.

The focus of this DPIA is the assessment of data protection impacts related to transitioning to a cloud service provider
for the operation of Altinn 3 and mainly concerns what *changes* in terms of processing, risk and vulnerability
assessments, necessary measures, etc., by moving the operation of Altinn to an international cloud service
provider.

The work with the DPIA is a continuous process. There will be a need for continuous updates and changes to the DPIA for
Altinn, for example, due to regulatory changes, new products being developed, etc. The reason for this latest update of
the DPIA is the adequacy decision dated July 10, 2023, which applies to the transfer of personal data between the EU/EEA
and the USA.

The obligation to ensure assessments of data protection impacts rests with the data controller, including the manager
who has the daily responsibility for the particular processing. The task itself can be delegated to others.

## 1.2 About Altinn

Altinn is an important public common solution that all state agencies, municipalities, county councils, and other public
enterprises can use to develop digital services for their users. Altinn also facilitates the need for digital dialogue
between public enterprises, citizens, the business community, and the voluntary sector.

Altinn is further developed, operated, and managed by the Altinn collaboration, consisting of several public agencies.
Digdir was established on January 1, 2020, following a merger of Altinn and Difi. Digdir is responsible for the
management of Altinn and decides how the technical solution should be further developed.

Altinn started as a collaboration between the Tax Administration, Statistics Norway, and the Brønnøysund Register Centre
in 2002, and was meant to be an ALTernative reporting channel for economic data. Altinn was officially opened by
former Finance Minister Per-Kristian Foss and Minister of Trade and Industry Ansgar Gabrielsen on December 4, 2003.

Since the portal www.altinn.no was launched, it has been growing continuously. The collaboration has been significantly
expanded and consists of 71 different service owners as of December 2023.

Today, Altinn is a well-established and extensive platform, experiencing strong growth in terms of data volumes,
associated public enterprises, and the number of electronic end-user services.

The Altinn solution is also continuously further developed with improvements to existing functionality and new
functionality.

Altinn also contains a lot of useful information for entrepreneurs and small/medium-sized businesses under "Start and
run a business" on altinn.no. Here is also an overview of all state support schemes for the business sector.

Over 4 million private individuals have an inbox (including «archive») in Altinn through their social security number,
and over 1 million businesses are registered as users through an organization number. From the start in 2003 until
November 2023, over 223 million electronic forms have been submitted through Altinn, while 559 million messages have
been sent to users' inboxes. This has led to savings in the billions for both the public sector and the business
community. And the use of services in Altinn is continuously increasing.

As a protective-worthy object, Altinn is subject to the Security Act, and thus strict conditions for the security of the
solution. In addition, Altinn is subject to the Personal Data Act and several other regulations that provide guidelines
for, among other things, security and processing of personal data.

Since its establishment 20 years ago, Altinn has, to a greater or lesser extent, used private providers for operation,
application operation, management, and further development. If the provider processes personal data as part of its
contractual relationship, a data processor agreement is also concluded with the provider. Through the Department of User
Experience and Data Sharing (BOD), the directorate follows up and controls the providers. Through everything from the
daily operational dialogue to contractual control and audit opportunities.

## 1.3 Altinn's Cloud Journey

Altinn is on a journey from today's "on-prem" operation and application operation of Altinn II, to a cloud-based
solution for Altinn 3. Digdir has an agreement to use Microsoft's public cloud solution Azure. The processing
responsibility, purposes, or legal bases for the processes do not change in principle by cloud operation of Altinn.
Digdir has chosen a data center in Norway as far as possible, and the rest are located in the EU.

Altinn is a large IT solution with many dependencies both internally and towards external stakeholders. Therefore, it is
important that a transition to the cloud can be done in several stages without disruptions or interruptions of existing
end-user services.

For Altinn to comply with long-term goals and strategies, the solution must primarily be able to offer a new service
development solution and be able to interact with other solutions and platforms in the public and private sectors. In
addition, the solution must be managed and further developed more quickly and efficiently than today's "on-prem"
solution.

The first delivery included a new service development solution consisting of development tools (Altinn Studio), runtime
environments (Altinn Apps), and a new platform with reusable micro-services (Altinn Platform). The new service
development solution utilizes the possibilities and features available in a pure cloud-based infrastructure.

![Concept](/nb/community/about/concept3.svg "Altinn 3 concept")

Altinn is intended to support cross-sectoral collaboration, which is also related to this new service development
solution, and introduces the need for a range of other and new collaboration functions. A cloud-based solution ensures
Altinn's opportunities to support future needs for digitalization in Norway.

The first version of Altinn 3 was put into production in June 2020. Furthermore, the goal is that functionality will be
further developed, and the services running on Altinn II will be re-established on Altinn 3 by June 2026 at the latest.
There is a need for a hybrid model during this transition period, with both an "on-prem" solution and solutions in the
public cloud.

Benefits and opportunities related to the transition to the cloud include:

- **Reduced downtime and more self-service**  
More efficient use of resources. Not least due to higher developer productivity, fewer handovers, and overhead
(opportunity for self-service). Faster realization of value from investments (shorter time from investment is made to
the value of the investment is realized). Reduced time from need/idea arises, to solution is exposed to users.

- **Pay for what you use**  
More efficient resource utilization and the opportunity for dynamic scaling, combined with only paying for the resources
one actually uses, leads to increased cost efficiency.

- **Increased efficiency in operations and delivery capability**  
By using better tools and increasing the degree of automation, resources used for operations will be reduced.

- **Increased opportunities for innovation** - both internal and external innovation. The cloud provides access to new
  and updated technology.

- **Access to new technology**

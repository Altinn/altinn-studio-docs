## Overview
This guide will help you get started with the system user integration process.

## System User
A System User is a new type of user in Altinn that allows an organization to grant authorizations to a non-personal user, enabling it to perform tasks on behalf of the organization.
The user works closely with Maskinporten, enabling access control through both Maskinporten and Altinn Authorization. With the system user, the authorization process becomes more streamlined, ensuring that the system provider only has the necessary access permissions.
In the future, the system user will be essential for organizations looking to automate their reporting and administrative tasks with the public sector.
There are two types of system users
1. Standard
2. Agent

### Standard
A standard system user is a user type designated for organizations that wish to access services provided by public or private sector entities through third-party systems.

### Agent
An agent system user is a user type intended for organizations that integrate with third-party systems on behalf of their clients.

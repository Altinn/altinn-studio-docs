A app will typical have a process that a end user / or system needs to follow. It could be anything from a single task process where the app is used
to retrieve data from some external api, to long living processes with many tasks involving. 

In Altinn Studio the developer will need to define the process for the app.

In current version of Altinn Studio the only support for process definition is to upload a BPMN process file and the only task type we support are FormFilling

[See Process Architecture for more details how process is define)()

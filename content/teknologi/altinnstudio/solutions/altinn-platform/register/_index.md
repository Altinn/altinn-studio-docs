## ER - Enhetsregisteret
ER registeret can be used to prefill information, retrieve information based on user input or for validation of input of users.

Altinn Platform does not have a own copy of ER. It currently uses Altinn II plaform as source for register.

See [Application architecture](/teknologi/altinnstudio/architecture/components/application/solution/altinn-platform/register/) for details.

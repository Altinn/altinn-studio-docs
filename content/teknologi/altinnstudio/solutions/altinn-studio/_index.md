**Altinn Studio** is a user-friendly solution where non-technical and technical
developers can create apps based on reuse and configuration of existing building blocks.

Examples on building blocks can be layouts, themes, web-components, texts, API-calls, code lists,
and process tasks.

Altinn Studio consist of serveral parts.

The designer part of Altinn Studio is the functionality that is provided for building and depoloying apps.
In the background, designer uses Git to communicate with [Altinn Studio Repos](/altinn-studio-repos) to store
the files created as part of the app, the same way a technical app developer
might use Visual Studio Code or other third party IDE to do the same.

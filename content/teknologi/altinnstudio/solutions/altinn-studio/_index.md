**Altinn Studio** is a user friendly solution where non-technical and technical
developers can create apps based on reuse and configuration of existing building blocks.

Examples on building blocks can be layouts, themes, web-components, texts, API-calls, code lists
and workflow steps.

In the background Altinn Studio uses Git to communicate with [Altinn Studio Repos](/altinn-studio-repos) to store
the files created as part of the app, the same way a technical app developer
might use Visual Studio Code or other IDE to do the same.

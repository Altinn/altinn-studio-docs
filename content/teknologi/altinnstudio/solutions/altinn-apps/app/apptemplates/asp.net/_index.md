This template is based on a [ASP.NET Core Web application](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps) with [Rest APIs](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/apis)

It is integrated with Altinn Platform making it easy to utilize the functionality provided in [Altinn Platform](/solutions/altinn-platform/) like [storage](/solutions/altinn-platform/storage/), [authentication](/solutions/altinn-platform/authentication/), 
[authorization](/solutions/altinn-platform/authorization/) and other components.

For web applications that need a web based UI, it has a [React](https://reactjs.org/) based frontend that can be [configured in Altinn Studio](https://altinn.github.io/docs/altinn-studio/app-creation/ui-editor/).

[ASP.Net Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-3.0) is a cross-platform, high performance,
open-source framework for building modern cloud-based, Internet-connected application.

## Quality Checklist

This page is a work-in-progress. Documentation planned in [issue 4125](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/issues/4125).

- [ ] referencing other pipelines is done by definitionId.

## Build Pipelines

The build pipelines are grouped in folders based on either the part of the solution they are used for
or the purpose of the pipeline. See build pipelines [here](https://dev.azure.com/brreg/altinn-studio/_build?treeState=XGFsdGlubi1hcHBz&view=folders).

### altinn-apps

There are _pull request_ and _master_ pipelines for app frontend and kubernetes wrapper.

The pull request pipeline builds a dockerimage and is triggered whenever a pull request is created or updated
that modifies code related to the component.

The master pipeline builds a docker image and pushes it to Azure Container Registry.
The pipeline is triggered whenever new code is merged into the master branch that modifies code related to the component.

Remaing pipelines in this folder are described below.

#### altinn-studio-build-app-image

- trigger: triggered by app developers in Altinn Studio
- details: builds a docker image of an app and pushes it to Container Registery.
- cloud component integrations: Azure Container Registry

#### altinn-studio-deploy-app-image

- trigger: triggered by app developers in Altinn Studio.
- details: Gets APIM Subscription key if required and deploys a new helm release to the correct AKS cluster.
- cloud component integrations: Azure API Management, Azure Kubernetes services

#### altinn-studio-update-deploy-release-db

- trigger: final step in build/deploy app image pipelines
- details: Sends request to designer to update status of a given buil or release of an app.

### altinn-platform / altinn-studio

Pipelines in altinn-platform and altinn-studio share the same structure.
There is a _pull request_ and _master_ pipeline for each component.

The pull request pipeline builds a dockerimage and is triggered whenever a pull request is created or updated
that modifies code related to the component.

The master pipeline builds a docker image and pushes it to Azure Container Registry.
The pipeline is triggered whenever new code is merged into the master branch that modifies code related to the component.

The pull request pipeline for the .net app template does not build a docker image,
but simply ensures that it is possible to build the app template used by Altinn Studio.

Pipelines follow this naming standard: [component]-(master/pull-request).

### code-analysis

Each component in the solution has their own analysis pipeline.
The pipeline runs unit and integration tests and triggers a sonar cloud analysis of the code.

Pipelines follow this naming standard: [component]-analysis-[langugage].

### load-test

The load-test pipelines are administered by the load-testing team.
The pipelines run k6 tests aimed at YT01.

### test

There are automated tests that are aimed at our running solutions and that
can be run in any environment.

The pipelines in this project have varying triggers. Some are
on a schedule and regularily run in one or all of our environments.
Others are triggered when a new release is deployed to an environment.

#### apps-and-platform-postman

- trigger: nightly schedule
- environment: at22
- details: tests platform and app APIs

#### studio-testcafe

- trigger: final task in release pipeline for Designer
- environment: all
- details: runs test caf√© test in Altinn Studio to validate most common functionality.

#### apps-k6

- trigger: N/A
- environment: N/A
- details: k6 tests to verify Altinn Apps behavior

#### platform-k6

- trigger: final task in release pipeline for relevant platform components.
- environment: all except YT01.
- details: k6 tests to verify Altinn Platform functionality.

## Release Pipelines

See all release pipelines [here](https://dev.azure.com/brreg/altinn-studio/_release?_a=releases&view=all&path=%5C).

Our release pipelines are set up with multiple stages.
This allows for different policies related to deploy and varying triggers.

Common for all release pipelines is that they rely on an artifact
containing the helm chart which is packed in Azure Studio Ops project.

Deploy to TT02 or production requires approval from a team member.
Weekly releases are scheduled for these environments.

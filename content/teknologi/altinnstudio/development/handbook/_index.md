The development handbook should provide all basic information needed to get started with development on Altinn Studio.
It should alto contain the information needed to make sure all developers write their code in a consistent way.

The development handbook should work as reference material, but it should also be possible to
read throught the whole handbook in a logical order so that new developers quickly get up and running.

The development handbook is a dynamic material and everybody should feel free to extend or correct articles when needed.

## 4.0.1 (2021-03-15) - Upgraded application to .Net 5 and grouped references of Altinn App and Altinn Platform services in Startup.cs

Altinn.App.* librarires target .Net 5 now, which requires that the application does the same.
In addition we have created two methods for referencing all app and platform sevices in Startup.cs 

See [breaking changes](../breaking-changes) for how to update you app to be compatible with this version.

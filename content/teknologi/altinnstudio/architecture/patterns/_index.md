The [architecture principles](https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf8-doc/arch/chap29.html) below is described like TOGAF recomends.




## Cloud Native
The solutions are designed and built using the ["Cloud Native"](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md) principles, meaning
it is built be scalable applications hosted in public cloud. 

Containers, microservices and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled components that are resilient, manageable, and observable. 

Combined with robust automation, they allow the devops team to make changes frequently.

The Cloud Native blueprint below show the important aspect of a Cloud Native solution.

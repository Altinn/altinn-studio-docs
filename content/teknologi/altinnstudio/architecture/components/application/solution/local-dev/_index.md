## Localtest loadbalancer
We use NGINX as loadbalancer for local development. Based on rules it redirect traffic between localtest platform and the app. 

Call between apps and localtest goes directly.

The app is of course same as it is in Altinn Apps. The difference is that it does not run as a container. 

See Altinn Apps for details about the construction components on a App.

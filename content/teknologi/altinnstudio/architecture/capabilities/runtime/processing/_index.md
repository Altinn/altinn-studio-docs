##	Processing Capabilities

### BPMN Process Execution
As part of the Application design and build in Altinn Studio the application developer will [define a BPMN Process](/teknologi/altinnstudio/architecture/capabilities/runtime/appdevelopment/) for the given App. 

The application framework used in the app template support reading and processing the process file. 

[Read the details about BPMN processing capabilities](process).

## Execution Control & Failure Mgmt Capabilities

###	Auditing, Logging & Tracing
Altinn Studio, The applications created in Altinn Studio and Altinn Platform perform auditing, logging and tracing of events that happens.

### Exception Management
Altinn Studio, applications created in Altinn Studio and deployed to Altinn Apps and Altinn Platform has exception management.

### Execution Profiling
With help of tools the platform support execution profiling.

##	Process Timing Capabilities

### Synchronous Processing
MOST API's in the platform is synchronous.

### Scheduled Processing (incl. Batch)
The solutions has the capabilitiy for scheduled processing. 

TODO: Describe user scenario.

### Queued & Asynchronous Processing
The solutions do support asynchronous processing.

## Execution Partitioning Capabilities

### Clustering 
The solutions has clustering capabilities.

### Load-balancing

The technical architecture has load balancing capabiltiies

### Fail over

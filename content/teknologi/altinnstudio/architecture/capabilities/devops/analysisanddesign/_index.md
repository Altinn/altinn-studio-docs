## Analysis Enablement Capabilities

### Requirement Capture

Requirements are gathered through:

- input on Github
- talks with organization

For some pilots, we choose to create larger epics on Github to group requirements.

Some example issues are

- [The issue for supporting Sirius App for tax department](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/issues/3747)
- [The issue for supporting NSM POB](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/issues/4731)
  
See [development application components](../../../components/application/nonsolutionspecific/development/)  to get an overview of the tools and applications we use.

### User story Definition

The DevOps team has the capability to define user stories in our GitHub repository.
[See all user stories](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/issues?q=label%3Akind%2Fuser-story+).

### Requirement Validation

Product owners and architects together with the teams are responsible for validation of requirements.

### Requirement Traceability

Github keeps a full history on the different issues.

### Prototypes, Mock-Ups & Storyboarding

The devopsteam has the capability to create prototypes.

See development application components for tools used.

## Design Enablement Capabilities

### UI Design Enablement

We use Figma to design the UI elements.

### Data Modeling & Design Capability

The devops team has the capability for data modelling and design.

See [development application components](../../../components/application/nonsolutionspecific/development/) to get an overview of the tools and applications we use.

### Architecture Design Enablement

Services created in Altinn Studio can be exposed as API together with GUI, or only as API without any GUI.

Each service will have its unique set of API's. Compared to current API it makes it possible to create API's that
have documentation that is target for the specific service.

What kind of API's a service would expose will be analyzed in the comming periode

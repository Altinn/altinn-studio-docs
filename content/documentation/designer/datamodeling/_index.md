The data model for a service typical defines the format of the data either sent to the service owner or presented in the service
for the user. 

The data model is important for a consistent and formal definition of the data. It will
be used for validation both from GUI and for external systems. 

Altinn Studio will support both importing existing data model as XSD or creating
a datamodell. In MVP only import is in scope. 

Some requirements for Altinn Studio is. 

- It should be easy to model data
- Built in replacment for SERES (Current tool)
- Need to support more formats.

**Altinn Studio** will be a user friendly solution where non-technical and technical
service developers can create services based on reuse and configuration of existing 
building blocks.

Examples on building blocks can be layouts, theme, web-components, texts, API-calls, codelist
and workflow steps. 

In the background Altinn Studio use git against the [Repositories](../repositories/) to store
the files created as part of the service, the same way a technical service developer
can use Visual Studio Code or other IDE to do the same.

on a quick and effecit way.

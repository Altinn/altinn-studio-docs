App frontend v4 brings with it some new features and breaking changes. This document aims to give an overview of the
changes and how they may affect your app. As always, with a new major version, we recommend that you test your app
thoroughly before deploying to production.

### Requires backend version 8.0.0
- https://github.com/Altinn/app-frontend-react/pull/1450
- 'required' validations no longer being filtered
- and more?

### Language rewrite
- https://github.com/Altinn/app-frontend-react/pull/1444
- New defaultValue feature helps (https://github.com/Altinn/app-frontend-react/pull/1441)
- Support for variables in deeply nested groups

### Most users will be prompted for party each time
In the Altinn profile it was possible to change a setting to 'not be prompted for party each time'. This setting was
mistakenly never read by app-frontend, so we failed to respect it. The default setting in Altinn profile is
_to be prompted_ for a party each time, so in v4 we changed the default behaviour of app-frontend to match the
setting in Altinn profile. This means that most users will be prompted for party each time they start an app, unless
they have changed the setting in Altinn profile.

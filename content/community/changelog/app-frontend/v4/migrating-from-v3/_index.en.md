{{% notice warning %}}

{{% notice info %}}
As of writing this documentation, the latest release candidate of app-frontend v4 is `4.0.0-rc2`. Updated information
[is available on GitHub](https://github.com/Altinn/app-frontend-react/releases). Before the release of v4.0.0 stable,
you will have to use exact version numbers in the URLs, e.g. `4.0.0-rc2` instead of `4`. Each time we release a new
release candidate and you want to try out the new release, this URL will have to be updated. When the stable
version is released, you can use `4` as the version number in the URLs and get the latest stable version automatically.

We are planning to release an upgrade tool that will automate the migration process and fix most breaking changes. 
Until then, you can use the following guide to migrate manually.

### Manual migration

To use App-frontend v4 in your app, you need to change which version is referenced in your app's `Index.cshtml` file. 
This file should be located in the `App/views/Home` folder. 
In addition to changing the version, you should also remove the links to the third party CSS and font, as the font is now loaded by App-frontend itself, and the third party CSS is no longer used.

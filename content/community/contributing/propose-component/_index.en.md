## Criteria

When a suggestion is reviewed we mainly focus on what the actual need is and what the component is meant to solve.
Is a new component needed, or do we have existing functionality that can be changed or expanded?

If a new component is the ideal solution, we want to make sure it has sufficient quality by making sure it fits these criteria:

- **Useful** - The suggestion should fit user needs, be understandable, recognisable and and not error-prone.
- **Accessible** - The suggestion should comply with the WCAG 2.1 standard.
- **Consequent** - The suggestion should reuse existing styles and components in the design system when relevant.
Users shouldn't have to worry that words, situations and actions has different meanings in different situations.
- **Versatile** - A new component should be designed in a way that makes it usable in similar scenarios and apps.

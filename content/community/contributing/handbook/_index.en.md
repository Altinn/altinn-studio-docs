This should provide all basic information needed to get started with development on the altinn-studio repo.
It should alto contain the information needed to make sure all developers write their code in a consistent way.

The guidelines should work as reference material, but it should also be possible to
read throught the whole development handbook in a logical order so that new developers quickly get up and running.

The development handbook is a dynamic material and everybody should feel free to extend or correct articles when needed.

The frontend is made up of several React applications. Each application covers a functional area.

## Structure
The applications are grouped by the 3 solutions:

- Altinn Studio (Designer)
- Altinn Apps
- Altinn Platform (Receipt)

## Technologies and frameworks
- https://reactjs.org/
- https://redux.js.org/
- https://redux-saga.js.org/
- https://material-ui.com/

## Architecture
Each frontend runs within a .NET web application, where the transpiled javascript & CSS are referenced.
- For Altinn Studio Designer and Altinn.Platform.Receipt, these files are deployed as part of the application itself.
- For Altinn.Apps frontend, these files are hosted on a CDN, and loaded in at runtime.

All of the frontend apps are set up with the same overall React + Redux architecture:

- **Component:** The react component
- **Props:** Define how the component should render
- **Store:** Contains all global state data used by the components
- **Action:** Triggered when a component updates
- **Reducer:** Listens to actions and updates the store according to which action is triggered
- **Redux-Saga:** Middleware. Intercepts the action before it reaches the reducer, in order to process data before it goes to the store. Useful for handling async operations like calling APIs.

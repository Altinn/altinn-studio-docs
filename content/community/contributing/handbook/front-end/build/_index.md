### Local build
Building an app locally is done by running 

```
yarn run build
```

from the apps root folder.

Some of the react projects also have various other predefined package scripts, which can be viewed in the `package.json` file which is located in the root folder of each react project, example `src/Altinn.Apps/AppFrontend/react/altinn-app-frontend/package.json`

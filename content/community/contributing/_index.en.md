You can contribute to making Altinn as good as it can be by: 

- **Following Altinn Studio on Github** You can follow the development in [Github](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/issues) 
and tell us that issues are important to you by giving them a thumbs up (üëç). If you have input on the issue we
recommend that you add a comment.
- **Report or fix bugs** If you have fond a but that's yet to be reported, we appreciate if you
[create an issue in Github](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%2Fbug&template=bug_report.md). 
If you have fixed a bug, you can [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests). 
- **New component/functionality** Are you in need of a new component or functionality while developing an app? 
If so, we appreciate that you tell us about your need, so that we can assess if the request matches
the patterns of interaction we want to support. We'll also assess if a new common component should be made,
or if an existing component can get added functionality. Thus we appreciate if you start by
[proposing a new component](./propose-component/) so that we can decide who will [develop the component](./develop-component/).

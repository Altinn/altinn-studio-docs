You can contribute to making Altinn as good as it can be by: 

- **Following Altinn Studio on Github** You can follow the development in [Github](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/issues) 
and tell us that issues are important to you by giving them a thumbs up (üëç). If you have input on the issue we
recommend that you add a comment.
- **Report or fix bugs** If you have found a bug that is yet to be reported, we would appreciate it if you
[create an issue on Github](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%2Fbug&template=bug_report.md). 
If you have fixed a bug, you can [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests). 
- **New component/functionality** Are you in need of a new component or functionality while developing an app? 
If so, we would appreciate it if you tell us about your need, so that we can assess whether the request matches
the patterns of interaction we want to support. We will also assess whether a new common component should be made,
or whether an existing component can get added functionality. Thus, we appreciate it if you start by
[proposing a new component](./propose-component/) so that we can decide who will [develop the component](./develop-component/).

description: Description of Altinn Content Delivery Network

Altinn CDN is a safe place for hosting static resources that can be reused and cached client side.

- across Altinn solutions
- across all apps created in Altinn Studio
- across apps belonging to one organisation

These resources are defined in a repo on GitHub: https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-cdn

The files and folder structure in this repo is mirrored to https://altinncdn.no, and can be use by different solutions and apps.

Each organisation (org) in Altinn has their own area for resources that they reuse across their apps. For example logo files.
This means that organisations can, if they want to, easily change logo for all apps at once without deploying updates to each app.

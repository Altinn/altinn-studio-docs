In the context of an [Altinn Studio](/altinn-studio) app, integration with Maskinporten is available using the built-in authentication client. Simply follow along with the [user guide](/altinn-studio/guides/integration/maskinporten) to get started.

For other _.Net_ apps, you can use this [standalone library](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-apiclient-maskinporten) to handle authentication. The library provides extension methods to configure HttpClients to authenticate with Maskinporten based on your provided configuration.

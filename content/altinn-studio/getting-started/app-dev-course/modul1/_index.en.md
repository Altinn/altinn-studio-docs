In this first module, we will create the service itself and set up a display name for the service.

[Navigate](../../navigation/) to [your service overview](https://altinn.studio). If you are not logged in to Altinn Studio, you will need to log in before you can see your service overview. If you have never created any services in Altinn Studio, this overview will be empty for now.

### Topics covered in this module:
- Create a new service
- Give the service a display name that users of the service will see when they use it

### Requirements from Sogndal municipality
- The service must have a sensible name that makes it easy to find among the large number of services Sogndal municipality has in Altinn Studio.
- It is desirable that one or more of the words "tilflytter" and "Sogndal" are included in the name.

## Create a new service

1. Click the "Create new application" button in the upper right corner of the screen.
2. Choose who will _own_ the service from the list of available owners. This can be _yourself_ or an _organization_ that you have access to.
   - If you choose your own user, you will be able to test all functionality in Altinn Studio, but will not have access to the test environment.
   - If you choose an _organization_ that you have rights for, you will also be able to publish the service to the organization's test environment.
3. Enter an identifying name for the service.
   - _The name can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. This name is used to identify the service and cannot be changed once it is set. Display names (that users of your service can see) can be set and changed after the service is created._
4. Click the "Create application" button.

Wait for the service to be created - this may take some time.
Once the service is created, you will be taken to the service's overview page. See the video below for how the steps above look in the tool.

## Set a display name for the service

The service needs a display name that is shown as the headline on the form and in the user's inbox in Altinn.

Set a display name by:

1. Click the "Settings" button in the menu bar at the top left
2. Change the "Application name" field to the desired display name

The change is saved when you leave the field. Once the display name is changed, you can see that it is also updated on the overview page.

In this module, you have created a service in Altinn Studio and given it a sensible display name.

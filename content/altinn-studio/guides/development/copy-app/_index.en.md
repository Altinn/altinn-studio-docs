In Altinn Studio you can make a copy of an existing application within an organization. This is done through the dashboard.
In order to do this you have to have permission to create new repositories within your org. Members of the teams "**Owners**" and "**Developers**" have these rights by default.
If you don't have permissions you should talk to your organizations administrator.

1. Click the "..."-icon in the far right table row of the app you want to copy.
2. Press "**Lag kopi**" from the menu
3. Add the **name** you want for the new application. This name is used to identify the application, as well as the repository name, and URLS and API's.
   The name should be short and descriptive, for instance "sick-leave" or "local-election-2019". ![Copy app](copy-app.png "Copy app")
    _The name can not be changed after the application has been published._
4. Create the copy by clicking "**Kopier app**".
5. When the application has been copied you will be redirected to the copied app.
6. In order for the copied app to work there is some changes in the source code. These changes has automatically been added as a pull request against your repository. To navigate to the repo click the profile-icon in the top right corner and choose "**Ã…pne repository**" ![Open repository](open-repository.png "Open repository")

8. Look through the pull request and make sure that the changes matches the new name of your application.
9. If everything is in order the pull request can be merged by clicking "**Merge pull request**".
10. The final step needed is to ensure that all changes are reflected in your user account in Studio. Navigate to the tab with your new app and click on the hamburger menu to the right of "Share your changes." Select "Local changes" from the menu.
11. Click "Delete local changes" at the bottom of the dialog that appears.
12. Enter the name of the app to confirm, and click the "Delete my changes" button. Wait for the dialog to disappear and for a confirmation that the deletion was successful.
13. Voila! You are now ready to develop on the copied app.

{{%/notice%}}

By runtime delegated signing, we mean an app where those who need to sign are granted rights during the form-filling process.

Typically, the app will ask the form owner to provide the social security number and last name of the individuals who need to sign, or alternatively, the organization number if someone with signing authority within a company needs to sign.

Once the form is fully completed, the user presses "Submit for signing".
The app will then delegate rights and send a message to the inbox in Altinn.
The recipient may also be notified via email and SMS, depending on the configuration.

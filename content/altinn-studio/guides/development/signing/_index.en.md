## Role based
In this scenario the people that should sign have the rights to read and sign due to a role they have, for instance CEO or auditor.

## Runtime delegated sign rights
In this scenario the end user fills out the social security number for persons and organisation number for organisations that should sign the form.
The application will then delegate rights to read and sign the form. They can also receive a notification on E-mail or SMS about a signing task in Altinn, depending on configuration.

## Sign and submit
In this scenario the person filling out the form should sign the form data at the same time that the form is submitted.

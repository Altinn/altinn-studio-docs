### Extend the app process with signing task:

A signing task must be added to `App/config/process/process.bpmn`.

We recommend doing this using the Altinn Studio process editor, so that the BPMN diagram is generated, to show the apps process.

Signing normally uses two user actions. If the Altinn user interface is used by the app, these will be called by button pressen in the signing step. If only the API is used, these must be called manually via the `/actions` endpoint or via process next.
- `sign`: The actual act of signing the data. Performed by the signees.
- `reject`: If the end user sees something wrong with the signing step, they can abort the signing step. All signatures and the signee state is deleted, and runtime delegated access rights are revoked. Which process step the user is taken to after this is specified in a gateway, as exemplified below.

```xml
<bpmn:task id="SigningTask" name="Signering">
  <bpmn:extensionElements>
    <altinn:taskExtension>
      <altinn:taskType>signing</altinn:taskType>
      <altinn:actions>
        <altinn:action>sign</altinn:action>
        <altinn:action>reject</altinn:action>
      </altinn:actions>
      <altinn:signatureConfig>
        <altinn:dataTypesToSign>
          <altinn:dataType>ref-data-as-pdf</altinn:dataType>
        </altinn:dataTypesToSign>
        <altinn:signatureDataType>signatures</altinn:signatureDataType>

        <!-- We have made a default validator that can be enabled here. It will validate that minCount on the signature data type is fulfilled. If default validation is not enabled, custom validation of the signatures should be added. -->
        <altinn:runDefaultValidator>true</altinn:runDefaultValidator>

      </altinn:signatureConfig>
    </altinn:taskExtension>
  </bpmn:extensionElements>
  <bpmn:incoming>SequenceFlow_1oot28q</bpmn:incoming>
  <bpmn:outgoing>SequenceFlow_1if1sh9</bpmn:outgoing>
</bpmn:task>
```


### Add data types for storing signing related data

The value of the node `<altinn:signatureDataType>signatures</altinn:signatureDataType>` must match the ID of the data type you configured in the previous step.

These data types should be added in the `dataTypes` array in `App/config/applicationmetadata.json`.

This data type is used to store the actual signatures that are generated when a user performs the sign action. 

```json
{
  "id": "signatures",
  "allowedContentTypes": [
      "application/json"
  ],
  "allowedContributors": [
      "app:owned"
  ],
  "minCount": 1
}
```

It is important to set `allowedContributors` to `"app:owned"`. This ensures that these data items cannot be edited via the appâ€™s API but only by the app itself. Before version 8.6, this was misspelled `allowedContributers`.

The ID can be set to something else, but they must match the IDs entered in `signatureDataType` in the process step, as shown in the process task step.

### Tilgangsstyring

Give `read`, `write` and alternatively `sign` to the instance owner. Others who should sign also need `read` and `write`.

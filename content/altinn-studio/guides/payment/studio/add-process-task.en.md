- Add a payment task to the process by dragging a payment task from the left menu in the process editor, and dropping it
  in the process. The following configurations are automatically set up when you do this:
  - 2 new data types related to payment are added (one for data about the payment, one for the payment receipt).
  - A new layout set used in the payment task is added, with a page configured to show payment information in the payment task.
  - A new rule for access management is added to the apps policy - this rule needs to be configured later.

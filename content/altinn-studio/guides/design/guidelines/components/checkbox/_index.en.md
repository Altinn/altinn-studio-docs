title: Checkboxes
description: Check boxes are used in cases where the user can select multiple alternatives in a list of options.
weight: 50
---
If the user should only be able to pick one option, use [radio buttons](../radiobutton/) instead.

### Guidelines:
- Check boxes should always have a connected text to their right. 
- Deactivated choice boxes should be avoided. If an alternative is unavailable, it should be removed and an explanation should be given in text as to why the option is missing. 

### Example of use:

<iframe style="border: 3px solid rgb(0 0 0 / 90%);border-radius: 9px;" width="100%" height="550" src="https://www.figma.com/proto/b2w3PuS5c0w8vVU3z8KOwp/Altinn-Studio-Komponenter?page-id=7669%3A83879&node-id=8014-10784&node-type=section&viewport=614%2C591%2C0.2&t=SzbxYOvMvvrcTZHf-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed" allowfullscreen></iframe>

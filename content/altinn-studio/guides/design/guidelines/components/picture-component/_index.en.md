### Guidelines:
- You must add alternative texts which explain the image.
- If an image is decorative, it's best to not include an alternative text.
- Don't use images for images sake. Ask yourself if the image illustrates a point or increases the understanding of what you are trying to tell.
- Check if the image scales well on different devices, like on mobile or a tablet. An image which looks good on a PC can quickly fill a smaller screen.
- Avoid using images with text, as it cannot be read by screen readers.

### How to write good alternative text
It is important that alternative texts are written consequently. We recommend following the suggested method by [UUtilsynet](https://www.uutilsynet.no/regelverk/bilder-og-grafikk/205)
- Never start with "Image of ..."
- Write short and start with the most important part of the image
- End by saying if the photo is a photo, illustration or graphic.

### Guidelines:
- There should only be one main button per page. Secondary choices can be added as secondary buttons. 
- The text on the button should be clear. Usually "Next" works well, but the button can also be formulated as an answer to a question (example below).
- The last/submit page of the form should have a green "Submit Form" button.

### Eksempel på bruk:

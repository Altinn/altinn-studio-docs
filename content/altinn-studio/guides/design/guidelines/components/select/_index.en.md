### The pull-down list should be used when:
- You have many alternatives (more than 5, but not unlimited)
- You have a recommended choice which is pre-selected
- It isn't important for the user to compare the alternatives
- You don't need the user to read every alternative
- The alternatives are known by the user (birth month, country of origin, etc)

### Example of use:

<iframe style="border: 3px solid rgb(0 0 0 / 90%);border-radius: 9px;" width="100%" height="550" src="https://www.figma.com/proto/b2w3PuS5c0w8vVU3z8KOwp/Altinn-Studio-Komponenter?page-id=7669%3A77399&node-id=8194-46299&node-type=frame&viewport=1641%2C-90%2C0.36&t=NWKC66RBFFxYRWoG-1&scaling=scale-down-width&content-scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed" allowfullscreen></iframe>

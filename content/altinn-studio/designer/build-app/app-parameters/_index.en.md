Settings can be configured at the service level, i.e., settings that apply to the entire service. Examples may include:
- Whether data should be deleted after submission
- Whether a list of ongoing instances should be shown to the user when they open the service
- Whether the service should be hidden from the user's inbox in Altinn
- Whether it should be possible to create a new copy of the service based on a previous submission

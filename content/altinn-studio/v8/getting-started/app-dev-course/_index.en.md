The introductory course is divided into 5 modules and covers a fictional case for Sogndal municipality.
Each module has a description of the task and links to relevant documentation.

You can choose to perform the tasks in [Altinn Studio Designer](/en/altinn-studio/v8/getting-started/) 
(graphical user interface with drag-and-drop) or in a [local development environment](/en/altinn-studio/v8/guides/development/local-dev/) 
(requires some technical competence).
You can also combine these approaches. All available modules can be completed in Altinn Studio Designer.

During these modules, you will have covered the most central functionality for an Altinn app,
as well as testing the application locally and in the test environment.

## Before you start

Before you can get started, you need to [create a user](/en/altinn-studio/v8/getting-started/create-user/) in Altinn Studio.

Read through the requirements specifications for Sogndal municipality and work through the modules one by one.

**Good luck!**

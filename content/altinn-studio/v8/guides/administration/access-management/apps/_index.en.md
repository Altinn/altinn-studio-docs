The following roles can be requested assigned to a user by the service owner:

- Test Developer
- Test Operations
- Prod Developer
- Prod Operations

[See an overview of the different roles here](/en/altinn-studio/v8/reference/access-management/apps/).

To be assigned these roles, authorised requesters at the service owner must order this through [Samarbeidsportalen](https://samarbeid.digdir.no/).
The portal also describes how to create a new user if you don't already have one.

To create a new case to request access, first click _Saker_ in the left menu, then _Ny sak_.
<br />
Then follow the guidance in the form (Altinn -> Bestille -> Tilganger -> Altinn 3.0 Apps -> Gå til skjema).

When the user has been assigned the requested roles logs and/or secrets can be accessed through [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

For login you use the same account as for the portal:

- `username@ai-dev.no` (most people)
- `username@ai-dev.brreg.no` (a few still uses this)

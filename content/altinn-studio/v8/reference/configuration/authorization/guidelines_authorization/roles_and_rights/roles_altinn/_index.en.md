Altinn has defined a set of generic roles that the entity (person/business) can use to authorize others to perform services on their behalf.
The description of the Altinn role sets limitations and specifies which steps in the work process, for which types of services, should be linked to it.

As an application developer, you must therefore always assess whether the intention behind the role description falls within your applicationâ€™s service area or not.
We strongly encourage you to contact Altinn for guidance in choosing the appropriate role requirements for the service.

The Altinn roles can be divided into two main categories: roles used for access management on behalf of businesses,
and roles used for access management on behalf of individuals.

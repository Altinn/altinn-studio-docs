## Authentication level

Required authentication level is set in the [XACML Policy]({{< relref "/altinn-studio/v8/reference/configuration/authorization/" >}}) as an obligation.

## ID-provider

It is possible to set up that an app will use a special ID-provider which is not the standard option. The standard option is ID-porten / Altinn's login.  

Currently the only approved ID-providers are:

- [FEIDE](https://www.feide.no/)
- [UIDP](https://www.udir.no/verktoy/uidp/)

Use of OIDC provider is set in appSettings

```json
    "AppOidcProvider": "uidp"
```

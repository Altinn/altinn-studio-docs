### Horizontal alignment with `grid`

{{% notice info %}}
`grid` settings are not yet supported in the form editor but can be configured manually.
{{% /notice %}}

The `grid` property controls horizontal alignment based on a 12-column layout.
 Items are allocated fractions of 12 which sets their width relative to the screen width.
  In the example below, we set the component's width to 2/12 of the screen width for all screen sizes (from `xs` and up).

You can also use `grid` to place items side by side.

See [Components placed side by side (grid)](/altinn-studio/v8/reference/ux/styling/#components-placed-side-by-side-grid) for details and examples.

## Usage

The *SigneeList* component allows the instance owner to get an overview of the signing process. It shows whether the delegation and
communication have been successful, and whether the signee has signed yet.

In the case of user delegated signing for an organization, the name of the signee is populated after a person has signed
on behalf of the organization.

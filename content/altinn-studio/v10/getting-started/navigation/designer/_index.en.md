Designer is the tool you start in after logging in to
https://altinn.studio.
It is a tool for designing, setting up and publishing apps.

## Open an App
You can see all the apps you have access to on the dashboard.
Click on the app you want to use to open it.

If you want to go to the repository for the app whilst working in the designer, you can go to the three dots at the top right and select **Repositorium**.

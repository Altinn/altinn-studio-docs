The platform runs on a secure, isolated and scalable infrastructure. It is integrated with multiple common solutions and open APIs.
You can use Altinn Studio both with user interfaces for manual submission and with APIs for machine-to-machine submission.


## What can I build with Altinn Studio?
With Altinn Studio you can develop digital services for many different purposes. This can be anything from simple form services and information solutions to complex workflows with payment and signing. The platform supports both traditional forms and tailored applications with advanced integrations.

See detailed overview of use cases [Insert link here:].

## Altinn Studio is the connector
A form is rarely just data fields to be submitted. You need more to create a good service. This can be:
- connection to ID-porten
- submission to case management systems
- connection to national registers

Altinn Studio has ready-made integrations with several of Digdir's common solutions and national registers. We continue to develop these and add more.

## Low-code and traditional code
Altinn Studio combines low-code and traditional coding. You can start with low-code in Altinn Studio Designer. If you have advanced needs, you can switch to dedicated development tools such as Visual Studio Code.

The goal is to be able to do as much as possible with low-code, but retain the possibility of traditional coding and the flexibility it provides. This way, non-technical resources can design and publish services without bringing in developers. At the same time, you can bring in a developer to create more advanced functionality that requires coding.


## Principles for Altinn Studio
These are some of the principles that underpin the development of Altinn Studio:

- **Free and open source**: We believe that openness and the opportunity for others to contribute is the way forward for developing services in the public sector.
- **Based on open standards**: Closed code ties you to vendors and often incurs additional costs.
- **Cloud-based infrastructure**: With loose coupling and without ties to a specific cloud provider.
- **Built on modern and popular frameworks**: It makes it easier for both us and our customers to acquire technical resources, and it is something people want to work with and learn.
- **Built-in security**: Each layer in the architecture authorises use independently of where the calls come from.
- **Isolation**: Each service owner gets their own environments for testing and production.

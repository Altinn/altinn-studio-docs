Altinn Studio is not perfect, but the tool takes you a long way towards building good digital services. We continuously add new functionality.

Instead of building something bespoke or buying something – why not contribute to the project where something is missing? This way you can give something back to society. The Altinn Studio teams handle quality assurance and further maintenance of the code.

## Community around service development
It is important for us to create a community around service development. We now have many contributors from various public agencies who help advance the product together with us. Contributions range from fixing typos that take seconds, to large components that have taken months to develop.

## Slack and GitHub
An important part of the community is the developer contact we have via Altinn Slack. Each service owner has their own channel where you can ask questions. We also see that service owners help each other and share experiences across organisations.

Everything is openly available on GitHub: backlog, user stories, plans and roadmap. This provides opportunities for both insight and comments.

	"description": "The authorization components provide access management and control functionality for digital and analog services hosted in the Altinn Platform or other places.",
	"content": "Altinn Authorization offers a collection of components and services that public entities, system providers, businesses, and citizens can use to achieve this.\nA typical use case is when a public entity needs to control who can read or change data in a service. The service can run on the Altinn platform or on the owner’s own platform.\nTo use Altinn Authorization, the service owner registers the service in the Resource Register. There they describe the service and set access policies that state who can use it, on whose behalf, and with which operations.\nAltinn Autorisasjon Businesses and private individuals can delegate rights through the Altinn Authorization user interface. They can see who has which rights on their behalf and revoke them when needed.\nSystem providers can integrate the same delegation and access checks in their own solutions using our APIs. This allows users to stay in their business system (for example, an accounting system) while still relying on Altinn for secure authorization.\n"

	"description": "What is Altinn 3 Broker?",
	"content": " What is Altinn Broker? The main use case for Altinn Broker is Managed File Transfer (MFT). It facilitates secure transmission of large files from one sender to one or more recipients. As such, it offers many benefits compared to alternative ad-hoc peer-to-peer file transfer solutions typically built on file transfer protocol (FTP), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) or secure file transfer protocol (SFTP).\nMain use case of Altinn Broker illustrated: File F1 is conveyed from a sender to one or more recipients via intermediate storage. While transfer of individual files is the main use case and original purpose of Altinn Broker, Altinn 3 Broker has been designed with some more advanced use cases and possible future extensions in mind. Advanced use cases and possible extensions are further described in separate sections.\nBenefits of Altinn Broker Compared to alternatives such as e.g., email, FTP or peer-to-peer file transfers, Altinn Broker offers a number of benefits. Some of the main benefits are:\nManaged service: Take the burden off Service owners and their solution vendors - security, maintenance, certified compliance with relevant vendors - security, maintenance, certified compliance with relevant legislation and regulations.\nFault tolerance and resilience: Altinn Broker is planned to support fault tolerant delivery of very large files.\nScalability and availability: Cloud hosting, DDOS protection.\nConnect to any system or user: Senders and recipients are de-coupled by separate upload and download processes; thus, each side is free to choose the preferred protocol for upload and download.\nSupport for several patterns and addressing schemes: One-to-one, one-to-many, content-based routing, and pub-sub.\nReal-Time Data Transfer: Altinn Broker use APIs and system events to trigger uploads and downloads.\nObservability and Auditability: End-to-end visibility of all activity, so you know the who, what, where, and when of data transfers. Quickly access file-transfer logs and analytics to audit transfer activity whenever needed.\nAdvanced monitoring: The built-in support for adding metadata to file transfers enables analysing file transfer sequences between multiple actors in\nend-to-end processes.\n"

This enables communication between senders and receivers of files regardless of which Altinn Broker service they are integrated to.\nThis service will allow service owners to link an existing Altinn 2 service to an Altinn 3 resource, and to forward Altinn 2 Broker Service requests to the Altinn 3 Broker Service app while not substantially changing the Altinn 2 Broker Service End User experience. This will then allow end users of the Altinn 2 service to communicate with end users of the Altinn 3 resource.\nFor Altinn 3 users, the user experience will not be different than if all users are using Altinn 3.\nAltinn 2 users will experience some minor differences related to file transfer and returned values compared to if all users are using Altinn 2.\n"

	"description": "Technical overview of how Dialogporten integrates with Altinn Authorization",
	"content": "Introduction Dialogporten is fully integrated with Altinn Authorization, which is used for all authorization decisions made in Dialogporten.\nFor performance reasons, there are two different ways that Altinn Authorization is utilized.\nAuthentication and coarse-grained authorization Dialogporten performs basic authentication and scope-based authorization via self-contained access tokens issued by Maskinporten and ID-porten, and optionally exhanged at Altinn Token Exchange.\nSee also\nHow to authenticate against Dialogporten Dialog list authorization All list views in Dialogporten utilizes the Authorized Parties API, that yields a list of all parties the authenticated user can represent along with all roles/access packages and service/instance rights that user has been granted for each party.\nDialogporten maintains a map of which roles/access packages grant rights to each resource in the resource registry, and uses that to fetch only dialogs referring to service resources that the user has some kind of access to. Which actions (read, write, etc) are not considered - any right for the given party for the given resource is sufficient to see the dialog in the dialog list.\nAs only one request (for a given party/service resource tuple) will have to be performed within a cache TTL window, re-sorting/filtering and pagination does not require additional requests to Altinn Authorization, and can therefor be performed quickly.\nDialog details authorization For dialog details, the PDP API is utilized, allow for fine-grained authorization of the various actions and transmissions defined within the dialog.\nAll actions and transmissions are decorated with a IsAuthorized flag, which indicates to the end-user system whether or not the user has access. If not, all URLs are removed.\nWhile Dialogporten indicates that the action is unauthorized, and removes the URLs, the endpoint should still always perform authentication/authorization on incoming requests and not rely on Dialogporten simply obscuring access to the endpoints "

You can read through the descriptions below to get an overview of the requirements. For each module we will repeat the relevant requirements to make it clear what the goal of the module is. Sogndal is in need of more young residents and wishes to become a desirable municipality for young adults and others who wish to settle down.\nThat is why they wish to create a service in Altinn aimed at people who are moving to Sogndal over the next six months.\nBy collecting data about newcomers at an early point, the municipality may facilitate and customize the services to the newcomers before the first moving box has even been packed.\nSogndal has a few requirements for the services described in the sections below.\nRequirements from the municipality Vis/skjul innhold Naming The application must have a sensible name that makes it easy to find it again among the large number of repositories, Sogndal keeps in Altinn Studio.\nThere are currently no plans for yearly revisions of the app, so the year does not need to be taken into account.\nThere is a wish that one or more of the words \u0026ldquo;newcomer\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sogndal\u0026rdquo; is included in the name.\nVis/skjul innhold Data Name and age of the person who is a newcomer First name Middle name (optional) Last name Age Address of the person who is a newcomer Street address Postal code Postal city Contact information of the person who is a newcomer Email Phone number Vis/skjul innhold Texts All input fields should have descriptive labels that clarify what should be filled in. The application must be available in bokmål, nynorsk and english. For the first edition it is sufficient that only one of these languages is available. It is important that the title of the application sounds good and is descriptive of the service.

Se en oversikt over våre ledige stillinger her. Line 2 in the text should be a link that directs to https://sogndal.easycruit.com/index.html. The text and link should only be visible if the user has chosen IKT (data/it). In all other cases, this will be hidden.\nConfirmation before submission Vis/skjul innhold Requirements The user should be presented with the data that will be used and consents (indirectly) to this by submitting the form.\nPossible operations At this point in the workflow the user should be able to\nView an overview of the data entered Exit the workflow without submitting the form Exit the workflow and submit the form Authorization The same role requirements should apply to both fill out and confirm an instance.

Previous residences should contain following fields:\nStreet address Postal code Postal city It should be possible to enter up to 10 former residences.\nValidation of previous residential addresses Vis/skjul innhold Requirements Due to a personal vendetta among one of the employees in the municipality of Sogndal, a user who enters postal code 4619 as a previous residence should NOT be allowed to move to Sogndal.\nIn this case, an error message should appear at the field in question with the following text:\nDu er ikke velkommen til vår kommune. Beklager! Data processing of invalid street address Vis/skjul innhold Requirements There is an address in Sogndal which is often misspelled by newcomers which leads to case workers having to spend a lot of time manually correcting it. Therefore, we want the app to automatically fix this mistake when the misspelled address is detected.\nIf the user enters Sesame Street 1 in the field Innflytter.Adresse.Gateadresse, it should automatically be corrected to Sesamsgate 1. For all other addresses the field should remain the same.\n"

These are stored in the Altinn Studio repository under App/models in the application\u0026rsquo;s file structure. An application has 4 model files:\nC# data model (\u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.cs): Data model used by the application\u0026rsquo;s backend/APIs to process and validate data. JSON Schema (\u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.schema.json): Data model in JSON Schema format used by the application on the client-side (frontend) to validate data in real-time. This is also the file that is worked on in the data modeling tool. XSD data model (\u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.XSD): Data model in XML format that defines the elements that can be used in a document. This is not directly used by the application but can be uploaded to generate the other model files in Altinn Studio or downloaded as needed. JSON metadata (\u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.metadata.json): Used by Altinn Studio to generate the \u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.cs file. This file will not be stored in the application and will only be generated if needed. Data models for organizations Data models for organizations are located in Altinn Studio\u0026rsquo;s repos. To access these, log in with an Altinn Studio user. If this is your first time using Altinn Studio, you need to create a user.\nThe data models are located in the \u0026lt;org\u0026gt;-datamodels repository, where \u0026lt;org\u0026gt; is the organization you belong to. For example, the data models for the organization \u0026lsquo;Test Department (ttd)\u0026rsquo; are located under https://altinn.studio/repos/ttd/ttd-datamodels.\nYou can find the link to this repository in the Altinn Studio Dashboard. Select Edit (blue pencil icon) to access the Altinn Studio Data Modeling tool. Select Gitea (green cup icon) to view the files directly in the repository.\nOverview of data model repo Access to Data Models By default, anyone can view an organization\u0026rsquo;s data models. To gain access to edit the data models, the user needs to be part of the Data models team in the organization. Refer to the access management for more information.\nUploading XSD to Repository XSD files can be directly uploaded to the tool Altinn Studio Data Modeling and are described under Upload and Display Data Model.\nIf you only need to upload XSD files for storage and do not intend to use the tool to edit the model, you can upload XSD files directly to the \u0026lt;org\u0026gt;-datamodels repo. To do this, navigate to the desired folder and select \u0026ldquo;Add file\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Upload file.\u0026rdquo; In the text field that appears at the top, you can enter the folder name you wish to use (optional).

Upload and Display Data Model The data model defines the data that can be submitted through an app and the allowed format of the data. Currently, we only support uploading XSD data models. When uploading an XSD model \u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.xsd, the tool will generate the following files: \u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.cs and \u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.schema.json (see Data Model Files).\nYou must be a member of an organisation to upload data models. Click Last opp datamodell (Upload Data Model) from the data modeling page if there are no existing data models or Last opp (Upload) from the toolbar at the top of the tool. Select an XSD data model file in the file picker and click Last opp. Upload Data Model After the data model is processed, you can find the generated files under App/models/ in the app repository.\nThe types defined in the data model are displayed in the left-side panel. A tree view of the data model can be opened to see a visual representation of the data model and the available fields.\nView Data Model Selecting a Model from the Dropdown List There are two categories in the dropdown list:\nXSD - These files are shown when there are XSD models without a corresponding JSON Schema model file. Selecting a model from the XSD list automatically imports it into the tool and generates a JSON Schema file, which you can then work on in the data modeling tool. JSON Schema - models generated after the processing of uploaded XSD models. Only data models placed in a repository\u0026rsquo;s App/models folder will be shown in the dropdown list. Create a New Data Model To create a new data model from scratch:\nClick Lag ny (Create new) on the left-side of the toolbar. Enter the name of the data model in the field. Click Opprett modell (Create model). Create a new data model The data model will be created with some example fields that you can work with or delete:\nproperty1 (text, required) property2 (text, required) property3 (text) New data model Editing a Data Model Select the model you wish to edit from the dropdown list on the toolbar.\nThe JSON Schema model is automatically saved as you work on it. To generate other model files such as XSD and C# files, you need to click Generer modeller (Generate Models) on the toolbar (see Generating Model Files). Add New Field To add a field at the top-level (root node), click \u0026ldquo;Legg til\u0026rdquo; (1 in below image).\nYou can add subfields to fields of the Object type by clicking the adjacent + button or by clicking the field and selecting the tab Felter (Fields) in the right-side panel.\nAdding a New Type Click on the + sign in the \u0026ldquo;Typer\u0026rdquo; panel on the left side (2 in below image).\nConverting Field to Type A field can be converted to a type by pressing the reference icon to the right of the field (3 in below image).\nAdd field and type and convert field to type Editing a Type Select the type from the panel on the left side. A tree view for the type will appear in the center. Properties for the type can be edited in the right-side panel. Add new fields by clicking the Legg til (add) button at the top. Select individual fields to edit their properties in the right-side panel. Exit the type editing mode by clicking Tilbake til datamodell at the top of the model panel. Deleting a Type Select the desired type from the panel on the left side. Click the delete button on the top field (root node) of the type. Note that it is not possible to delete types that are in use.\nType References A type reference is a field that follows the structure of a custom type. For instance, if you have the type Address with fields StreetName, PostalCode, and Location, adding a reference to that type will automatically add these fields. The type is displayed next to the field name in the tree view.\nType references Adding a Type Reference Drag and drop a type from the left side panel into the tree view (middle section). This will create a new field with the chosen type.\nYou can also add a type reference as a subfield by dragging the type into an existing field.\nNOTE\nTo add a reference as a subfield, the parent field must be of type Object. Deleting a Field Click on the delete button to the right of the node/field.\nEditing Properties of a Field Click on the node/field you want to edit to display the properties in the right-side panel. Edit the properties of the node/field as desired. The available properties for the field will vary based on the base type of the field. Editing/Adding XSD attributes, namespaces, etc., including dataFormatId and dataFormatVersion. This is currently not directly supported in the tool and must be done manually. Descriptions on how to do this can be found in the links below:\ndataFormatId og dataFormatVersion XSD attributter generelt XSD namespaces Generating Model Files (XSD and C#) Once the model is ready, you can generate model files by clicking on the Generate Models button in the toolbar. Both XSD and C# model files will be generated. Remember to click Del dine endringer (Upload your changes) on the right side of the main menu in Altinn Studio to save your changes.\nDownloading XSD A generated XSD file can be downloaded by accessing the repository: click on the person icon in the top right corner of the page and select \u0026ldquo;Open repository.\u0026rdquo; Navigate to the desired file in App/models/ and click on the download icon.\nDownload XSD from repo "

	"description": "Reference information about front channel embeds",
	"content": "Introduction See getting started with front channel embeds for an introduction.\nBelow are the terms used on this page.\nEnd-user system (EUS) EUS is used to describe the system that the end user uses - usually the client side of a web browser application, running JavaScript or WebAssembly code. Content provider system (CPS) The content provider system is the system that responds to the endpoints (URLs) that the FCE refers to. This is usually the service provider platform (such as Altinn 3). Basic steps The end-user systems (EUS) identifies a particular content as a front channel embed The end-user system performs (without user interaction) a request to the specified end-point with the dialog token The content provider system (CPS) responds with data in accordance with the defined content media type The end-user system handles the response, renders the data in accordance with the defined content media type, and embeds the data into the UI Step 1: identifying a front-channel embed See content types for a list of content fields for which a FCE may be used as a media type. This list might change, so EUS implementors are adviced to handle FCE media types on any content field.\nThe FCE media types can be identified by their prefix application/vnd.dialogporten.frontchannelembed-url. All FCEs however, also provide a remote content type suffix, which indicates the type of data that the endpoint at CPS can be expecte to return. Currently, two formats are allowed (for Markdown and HTML), which gives us these valid media types:\napplication/vnd.dialogporten.frontchannelembed-url;type=text/markdown application/vnd.dialogporten.frontchannelembed-url;type=text/html Example { // Content on dialog level (defining only a \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34; translation) \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: { // ... \u0026#34;mainContentReference\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://example.com/fce?lang=nb\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;languageCode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;mediaType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;application/vnd.dialogporten.frontchannelembed-url;type=text/markdown\u0026#34; } }, // Content on transmission level (defining only a \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34; translation) \u0026#34;transmissions\u0026#34;: [{ // ... \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;contentReference\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://example.com/fce?lang=nb\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;languageCode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;mediaType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;application/vnd.dialogporten.frontchannelembed-url;type=text/markdown\u0026#34; } } }] } Step 2: Performing the request (using CORS protocol) Once identified, the EUS MUST perform a GET request to the specified endpoint using a HTTP client mechanism that supports either HTTP 1.1 or 2.0. The request MUST contain a Authorization: Bearer \u0026lt;dialog token\u0026gt; header, using the dialog token supplied with the dialog. The EUS MUST make sure that the dialog token is no older than 10 minutes. A new dialog token is issued with every request to the dialog details endpoint in the Dialgporten end-user API (either REST or GraphQL).\nThe EUS MAY supply a Origin header in accordance with the CORS protocol. The EUS SHOULD NOT supply any cookies belonging to the domain of the CPS endpoint.\nStep 3: Handling the request at the CPS endpoint The CPS MUST validate the received token by checking the token signature against the Dialogporten published JWKs, and checking that the token is not expired. Additional validations MAY be performed (ie. checking the \u0026ldquo;actions\u0026rdquo; claim). The CPS MAY validate that Origin header, but MUST NOT rely on this header alone for authorization purposes as this can be easily spoofed.\nGiven a successful authorization and no other error conditions, the CPS MUST respond with a 200 OK and a Content-Type header matching the remote content part of the media type for the FCE (currently either text/markdown or text/html) and a body containing the content for the FCE. The body MAY be empty, in which the CPS MAY use the response code 204 No Content.\nIn case of any errors arising, see error handling below.\nStep 4. Handling the response The EUS MUST follow redirects (3xx) responses, but also MUST handle infinite redirects by limiting the number of redirects to a number no less than 5. The EUS MUST ensure that the returned Content-Type header matches that of the FCE mediatype. The FCE MUST handle an empty response body, in which no UI changes should occur, allowing the CPS to utilize FCEs as a way to trigger remote processes.\nGiven a successful response (200) and a non-empty body, the EUS should render the content and inject it into the UI at its own discretion.\nIn case of any errors arising, see error handling below.\nError handling Any errors occuring on the CPS side MUST result in a 4xx or 5xx HTTP status code being returned to the EUS. This should follow standard HTTP semantics (ie. 4xx being client side errors and 5xx being server side errors).\nNote that the end-user very rarely are \u0026ldquo;to blame\u0026rdquo; for FCE errors to occur, and will have few, if any, ways to remedy the situation. Error messages should therefore be of a generic nature, and only display specific details of the error to the user when there is actionable information available. The CPS MAY supply a RFC9457 Problem Details response body, adding additional details about the error condition occured, including a \u0026ldquo;details\u0026rdquo; field with human readable information that the EUS MAY display to the end user for support purposes. The error details MUST be localized to the language indicated by the content field.\nThe EUS MUST handle 5xx and 4xx by displaying a generic, localized error message, and MAY include the CPS provided details, if available. The EUS SHOULD take steps to make it clear for the end user what information was provided by the CPS. Both the EUS and the CPS SHOULD log the error that occured for further diagnosis.\nConstraints Here are the constrains of the FCE remote content types that both CPSs and EUSs must adhere to:\nGeneric (HTTP etc) Response bodys MUST NOT exceed 100KB EUS clients SHOULD terminate the request if no response has been received after 10 seconds, displaying a generic error message Markdown and HTML CPS implementors MUST ensure that the returned markdown adheres to the current CommonMark specification (0.31.2). EUS implementors SHOULD use a well-known library for rendering, in accordance with the constraints listed below. The resulting HTML rendered to the end-user MUST consist of only the tags specified below. Both the CPS and the EUS MUST take steps to ensure this. All attributes causing script execution is disallowed MUST NOT be produced by the CPS and MUST be stripped by the EUS EUSs SHOULD clearly indicate that any links provided pointing to external URLs are in fact external, and add rel=\u0026ldquo;noreferrer\u0026rdquo; attributes to the anchor tags Allowed tags HTML Tag Purpose Markdown Equivalent \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; Paragraphs Plain text separated by a blank line \u0026lt;em\u0026gt; Italic / emphasis *italic* or _italic_ \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt; Bold / strong emphasis **bold** or __bold__ \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; / \u0026lt;ol\u0026gt; / \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; Lists - item, 1. item \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; Links [link](https://example.com) \u0026lt;code\u0026gt; Inline code `inline code` \u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt; Code blocks ```js\nconst x = 1;\n``` \u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt; Blockquotes \u0026gt; quoted text \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; Horizontal rule/separator --- or *** \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;–\u0026lt;h6\u0026gt; Headings # H1, ## H2, \u0026hellip;, ###### H6 \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Line break Line ends with 2+ spaces + Enter "

	"content": "ServiceOwners In order to use the Broker Transition solution in Altinn to create, upload and retrieve file metadata, a service owner must complete the following steps.\nHave an existing Altinn 2 Broker Service. Have or create a corresponding Altinn 3 Broker Resource. See how to get started with Altinn Broker here. To configure your resource to correctly function as a Broker Transition service, see below. Request a transition setup from the Altinn 2 Service to the Altinn 3 Resource, see below for details. Go live with the transition solution while encouraging consumers to migrate to Altinn Broker. Once all consumers have migrated to Altinn Broker, decommission the Altinn 2 Broker Service. Configure Resource for Transition Solution To configure the resource to function in the Transition Solution, and work as closely as Altinn 2 service, you should set the following values when configuring the resource\nBase these values on your existing Altinn 2 service, and set the values to the same where applicable.\nMaxFileTransferSize = \u0026ldquo;1073741824\u0026rdquo; (1 GB - max allowed in Altinn 2). FileTransferTimeToLive = The equivalent TimeToLive of the Altinn 2 service, most used \u0026ldquo;30D\u0026rdquo; - 30 days. PurgeFileTransferAfterAllRecipientsConfirmed = The equivalent TimeToLive of the Altinn 2 service, most used \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; PurgeFileTransferGracePeriod = \u0026ldquo;PT24H\u0026rdquo; - Files will not be deleted before 24hrs have passed (was hard-coded to 48hrs in Altinn 2). Must be ISO8601 Duration and 24 hours is the max. If you need to use the Manifest file feature, you also need to set the following values.\nUseManifestFileShim = true. ExternalServiceCodeLegacy = set to External Service Code for the legacy service. ExternalServiceEditionCodeLegacy = set to External Service Edition Code for the legacy service. Once you have transitioned all users over to Altinn 3 APIs, you are free to change the values according to your own preferences. The last 3 values used only in the transition solution to create the manifest, and should be set to false/null.\nRequest Transition Setup The transition setup is configured in the Altinn 2 codebase, and once it has been set, the traffic for the defined service will be redirected to Altinn 3. Please provide the necessary details, and make sure the relevant details match what you set for the resource.\nExternalServiceCode and ExternalServiceEditionCode of the Altinn 2 service. ResourceId of the Altinn 3 resource. The environments where the change should be performed. Altinn 2 TT02 -\u0026gt; Altinn 3 TT02/Staging Altinn 2 PROD -\u0026gt; Altinn 3 PROD The date and time for the change(s) to go live. Contact us in the public slack channel Altinn@Slack#produkt-formidling, and we will perform the needed steps.\nPerforming this configuration change does not create downtime in Altinn 2, but there will be a short timeframe of \u0026lt;1 minute where the configuration is loaded onto all servers and the transition solution is active.\nAdditional Service Owner information After the transition setup has been activated, the Altinn 2 service will no longer pass requests to the Altinn 2 Broker Storage, but instead be forwarded to Altinn 3. This means existing Broker files in the Altinn 2 Broker Storage will become unavailable for end users once the service is set up to transition to Altinn 3.\nDue to this, we recommend you plan for a downtime period for your service in which no new files are created, but you allow all recipients to download their files before you perform the transition. The exact length of time depends on the work pattern of your recipients; how long they take before they download available files. If you do not know. contact us and we may be able to generate some statistics to guide you to a decision.\nOne method of enforcing this is to use Altinn 2 SRR to temporarily remove the \u0026ldquo;write\u0026rdquo; access for all the organizations you have approved as senders, but keep the \u0026ldquo;read\u0026rdquo; access for all recipients. Once the transition has been set up, you can give the \u0026ldquo;write\u0026rdquo; access back to all the senders, and the files will now be created i Altinn 3.\nBe aware that SRR Rights in Altinn 2 are cached for 10 minutes (SC+SEC+Orgnr), so ensure to afford this amount of time between adding/removing the rights and other steps of your go-live plan. End Users For end users, there is very little technical difference between using an Altinn 2 Broker service and a Broker service that has been transitioned to Altinn 3. But all consumers should have their technical team go through this documentation to determine if the changes in the Transition solution require changes to their implementation or code.\nFunctionally, receipts will no longer have a Receipt Id, and if enabled, the manifest files will not have a File List.\nAdditionally, while in Altinn 2 Broker Services a file is virus-scanned as part of the upload process, in Altinn 3 the virus-scanning is done after upload, which means an uploaded file in Altinn 3 will not be immediately available, unlike in Altinn 2. The file will be made available once the automatic virus scan is completed.\nCalls to get Receipt through external Receipt SOAP endpoint is not supported. If this is a requirement of a service owner or end user, please send us a feature request.\n"

This ID becomes the primary reference to the resource.\nMigration When you click \u0026ldquo;Import\u0026rdquo;, Altinn Studio creates a new resource in your organisation’s repository.\nThe Resource Registry requires more complete data than Altinn 2. You must add:\nTitle in Bokmål, Nynorsk, and English Delegation text in Bokmål, Nynorsk, and English Description in Bokmål, Nynorsk, and English Contact information for the service (can be displayed in the service catalogue) Migration Access Rules Import creates access rules that mirror those in Altinn 2.\nAdd any relevant access packages so the service is ready for a transition to access packages based on Altinn roles.\nMigration For delegation migration to succeed, the policy must still contain the rules that exist in Altinn 2. For example, you cannot remove the signing rule if it was part of the service there. Publishing When the resource information is complete, you can publish it to the test or production environment.\nChanging API Integration To enforce access control in external services, the service owner must call Altinn access control (PDP). The API is based on the XACML standard.\nThe request contains:\nWho wants to perform the request Which resource the request concerns, and the party associated with it Which operation the end user wants to perform You can check multiple operations in the same request if needed.\nMigration of Delegations Most linked services have active delegations in Altinn 2. These rights are granted from an actor to a person or organisation. To preserve user access after moving to the Resource Registry, the delegations must be migrated.\nIn Altinn Studio you can start a batch job for services created from an imported Altinn 2 resource. The job:\ndeactivates the Altinn 2 service so delegations cannot change during the migration copies the delegations to the new resource in Altinn 3 The functionality is currently hidden behind a feature flag in Altinn Studio.\nlocalStorage.setItem(\u0026#34;featureFlags\u0026#34;, \u0026#39;[\u0026#34;resourceMigration\u0026#34;]\u0026#39;); Run the command in the browser console (developer tools).\nAfter you start the batch job it takes roughly ten minutes before it kicks off. The first step is to deactivate the service in Altinn 2 before migrating to Altinn 3.\nThe service must already be deployed to the environment in which you plan to migrate delegations. We strongly recommend testing in TT02 before running the job in production.\nMigration options in Altinn Studio Migration options in Altinn Studio When the job finishes, the delegations are transferred. Verify the result manually for now—counts are not yet available. We welcome feedback from service owners so we can fine-tune the process.\nCreating Reference to Altinn 2 Service If you have created a resource in the Altinn 3 Resource Registry without using the import functionality, you can add the reference manually.\nAdd the reference by editing the resource file in Gitea with content similar to:\n\u0026#34;resourceReferences\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;referenceSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;reference\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;5600\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;referenceType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ServiceCode\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;referenceSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;reference\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;100\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;referenceType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ServiceEditionCode\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;referenceSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;reference\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://test.landbruksdirektoratet.no/disko/soker\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;referenceType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Uri\u0026#34; } ] Remember to use the correct service codes and URL.\n"

Access packages define which services and resources the system user should have access to.\nImportant: There are specific access packages for client systems (agent system users) that cannot be used for system users for your own system. These access packages are designed to handle delegations from clients to service providers (such as accountants, auditors, or business managers), and therefore require client relationships that are established via the Central Coordinating Register or direct delegation.\nThe access packages for client systems must be linked to the roles Accountant (REGN), Auditor (REVI), or Business Manager (FFOR). See the table of available access packages based on ER roles for an overview of these specific access packages.\nYou can also create a system user for client relationships with regular access packages, as long as the client has delegated the access package to the organization that owns the system user.\n\u0026#34;accessPackages\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;urn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:accesspackage:skattnaering\u0026#34; } ] ClientId A system can be associated with multiple client IDs. These client IDs must be relevant client IDs that are defined on the Maskinporten client of the system vendor or those who will retrieve the system user token. The client IDs are generated for integrations in Maskinporten, and each one is unique, tied specifically to a system. As a result, a client ID cannot be reused for a different system. If the system linked to a client ID is deleted, the client ID may be reassigned to a new or existing system.\nImportant: clientId is a required field when creating a system, but unfortunately the content cannot be validated. These client IDs must be relevant client IDs that are defined on the Maskinporten client of the system vendor or those who will retrieve the system user token. Without a correct client ID, you cannot retrieve a system user token for the system user.\n\u0026#34;clientId\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;32ef65ac-6e62-498d-880f-76c85c2052ae\u0026#34; ] IsVisible The vendor can decide whether the system should be visible in the Altinn portal for end users to manually create it.\nImportant: You cannot set IsVisible = true in combination with an access package intended for client relationships. See the table of access packages for client relationships for which access packages this applies to.\nTrue: The system is visible in the user-driven system creation process in the Altinn portal. False: The system is not visible in the Altinn portal and can only be created by the vendor through the vendor-driven system creation process. AllowedRedirectUrls This is to whitelist the urls that is allowed to be set in the redirecturl for a vendor driven system user request. Only https urls are allowed.\n\u0026#34;allowedredirecturls\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;https://vg.no\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://nrk.no\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://altinn.no\u0026#34; ] "

	"content": "Consider What are the current challenges? Start by defining the problem. What are you going to solve? It is easier to create a solution with a clearly defined scope for your problem. It might be a good idea to gather your project group, and to look for a nice wall to put post-it notes on. Who are the users and what are their needs? We recommend starting by defining your target audience and their requirements as early as possible during the project. Create an overview of your users and who they are. In most cases your service should be usable by multiple user groups. Are they citizens or do they represent a company? What background do they have? Are they digitally inclined or not accustomed to digital services? This phase normally starts with interviews, observations or a focus group. Points of contact for the user Create an overview of the points of contact for the user. What does the customer see during their use of your service? One way to do this is pictured below: Points of contact Should Altinn be hidden from the end user or will you be using Altinns internal UI? Does this match how the user expects to complete their task? Is it possible to offer the customer the relevant part of Altinn in the context they are in, instead of sending them back and forth? What data do you need? The need for a digital solution usually starts with a need to gather data. Start by checking if someone else has the data you need, and if it is available for reuse. You can check for data in our common datacatalog. If not - how can you request it in a way that requires the least effort by your users? Sometimes it could be an idea to try something different than than obvious solutions where you ask through a form. After working through the initial phase and defining the user requirements, we recommend that you set up a prototype that can be tested by relevant users. If you are creating a form, you can use our prototype-Kit for Figma.\n"

In XML, a repeating group is defined as a list of elements, where each element is a group/object with properties.\nExample Below is a form with a repeating group that:\nContains two components (checkbox and address) Can be repeated up to three times Is bound to the data model group/array GruppeListe Form with repeating group Vis/skjul innhold Show configuration for this screenshot 1[ 2 { 3 \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;gruppe\u0026#34;, 4 \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, 5 \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ 6 \u0026#34;avkrysningsboks\u0026#34;, 7 \u0026#34;adresse\u0026#34; 8 ], 9 \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 3, 10 \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { 11 \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;GruppeListe\u0026#34; 12 } 13 }, 14 { 15 \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;avkrysningsboks\u0026#34;, 16 \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Checkboxes\u0026#34;, 17 \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { 18 \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Avkrysningsboks\u0026#34; 19 }, 20 \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { 21 \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;GruppeListe.Avkrysning\u0026#34; 22 }, 23 \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: [ 24 { 25 \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Navn\u0026#34;, 26 \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Verdi1\u0026#34; 27 }, 28 { 29 \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Adresse\u0026#34;, 30 \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Verdi2\u0026#34; 31 } 32 ], 33 \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true 34 }, 35 { 36 \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;addresse\u0026#34;, 37 \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AddressComponent\u0026#34;, 38 \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { 39 \u0026#34;address\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;GruppeListe.Adresse\u0026#34;, 40 \u0026#34;zipCode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;GruppeListe.Postnr\u0026#34;, 41 \u0026#34;postPlace\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;GruppeListe.Poststed\u0026#34; 42 }, 43 \u0026#34;simplified\u0026#34;: true, 44 \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: false, 45 \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true 46 } 47] Parameters Parameter Required Description id Yes Unique ID, same as ID on other components.

	"description": "This guide describes how you, as an end-user system vendor, register a system in the system registry.",
	"content": " Target Audience: Developers or technical integration managers at end-user system suppliers (SBS).\nPrerequisites You must have some prerequisites in place before you register a system, see the Getting Started guide.\nInstructions Registration of an end-user system is done by calling Altinn\u0026rsquo;s system registry API with a JSON payload that defines the system.\nNote: The token used must have been assigned the scope: altinn:authentication/systemregister.write. Step-by-step Structure the JSON payload Prepare a JSON payload to be sent to the API. Below is a detailed description of the fields.\nDefine Identifiers\nid: A unique identifier for the system. Format: {systemsupplier_orgnr}_{chosen_name}. Example: 991825827_smartcloud. vendor: Contains the organization number of the system supplier. Format: ID must be set to 0192:{orgnr} to specify a reference to the Brønnøysund Register Centre (Enhetsregisteret). Example: \u0026quot;ID\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0192:991825827\u0026quot;. Important: The organization number used in id and vendor.ID must match the organization number in the authentication token (Maskinporten or Altinn). To get a real organization number created in TT02, the SBS must contact servicedesk@altinn.no. Define Visible Texts\nSpecify the name and description to be displayed for the system in the Altinn portal. Texts must be provided for all supported languages: nb (Bokmål), nn (Nynorsk), and en (English). Define Rights (rights and accessPackages)\nSpecify which services or access packages the system requires access to. Use rights to specify individual resources (e.g., urn:altinn:resource). Use accessPackages to specify predefined access packages (e.g., urn:altinn:accesspackage:skattegrunnlag). Note: These rights must be defined correctly before a system user can be created for this system. Link Client ID (clientId)\nProvide a list of clientId values (as UUIDs) that have been generated in Maskinporten for this integration. A system can be linked to multiple client IDs. This is the same client ID that will later be used when creating a system user towards Maskinporten. Set Visibility (isVisible)\ntrue: The system is visible in the Altinn portal and can be used to create a system user from there (user-managed creation). false: The system is not visible in the portal. In this case, the system user must be created through a supplier-managed process. Important: A system cannot be set to isVisible: true if it simultaneously has IsAssignable: false (a field that controls assignability, not shown in the JSON example). Set Redirect URLs (Optional) (allowedredirecturls)\nThis field is optional and can be omitted or set as an empty list ([]).\nIf the field is used, it must contain a list of exact URLs that are approved for redirection in the system user creation flow.\nIf the list is defined, a system user request must use a URL from this list (or a subset of it).\nExample JSON Payload Use the following structure as a template for your JSON payload:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;991825827_smartcloud\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;vendor\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;authority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;iso6523-actorid-upis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0192:991825827\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SmartCloud 1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SmartCloud 1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Smart SKY\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SmartCloud er verdens beste system.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SmartCloud Rocks.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SmartSky er vestlandets beste system\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;rights\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;resource\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ske-krav-og-betalinger\u0026#34; } ] }, { \u0026#34;resource\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ske-innrapportering-amelding\u0026#34; } ] } ], \u0026#34;accessPackages\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;urn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:accesspackage:skattegrunnlag\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;clientId\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;32ef65ac-6e62-498d-880f-76c85c2052ae\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;allowedredirecturls\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;https://smartcloudxxxx/receipt\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;isVisible\u0026#34;: true } Send the API call\nUse a POST request to create the system the first time.\nUse a PUT request to modify an existing system.\nIMPORTANT: A PUT request overwrites the entire system definition. When you need to make changes (e.g., add a new access package), you must retrieve the existing definition, make the changes, and then send the entire updated JSON payload in the PUT call. If you only send the new changes, all previous information will be deleted.\nAlways include your valid Maskinporten or Altinn token in the Authorization header for authentication.\nVerification and Notes Verification: After successful registration, the system will be available for creating system users. If isVisible is set to true, the system will also be visible in the Altinn portal. Modification: Systems that are registered can be modified and deleted afterwards via the API. "

	"description": "The Altinn 3 Broker Transition Solution allows service owners who own broker services in Altinn 2 to point those services towards Altinn 3 using an internal Altinn 2 bridge.",
	"content": "About The Altinn 3 Broker Transition service bridge is an internal component in Altinn 2 that transfers Broker requests from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3 for a given request, based on the ServiceCode/ServiceEditionCode combination of the request. This is an implementation of the soft shift solution described here.\nTechnical overview Altinn 2 allows end users in Altinn 2 to make BrokerService requests for specific Broker Services that will be transferred to Altinn 3 instead of being stored in Altinn 2. Files transferred in this way will be available for Altinn 3 and Altinn 2 users.\nAuthentication and authorization are primarily performed at the API endpoint being called (Altinn 2 or 3). For Altinn 2, authentication/authorization is performed at the service level before routing the service calls to Altinn 3 through a dedicated endpoint that can assume service-level authentication and authorization are OK. For Altinn 3, everything happens internally within the environment. This means that you need both an Altinn 2 service (with associated authorization rules and setup in SRR) and an Altinn 3 Broker Resource with access defined in the Resource Registry. This is a natural pattern when setting up a transition solution for an existing service, but it is worth noting if you want to set up dedicated test services.\nRequests that have the ability to specify ServiceCode / ServiceEdition. In this case Altinn will immediately determine that the request should be transferred to Altinn 3 via the Altinn 3 Broker Bridge. In cases where the SC/SE can be specified, but aren\u0026rsquo;t, requests will not be transferred to Altinn 3. Requests that do not have the ability to specify SC/SE. In this case a call will first be made to Altinn 2 Broker storage. If nothing is found in Altinn 2, a call will be made to Altinn 3. Files in Altinn 3 cannot be larger than 1 GB, as this is the maximum file size in Altinn 2. The Altinn 3 Resource should be configured with this max filesize restriction. File data and metadata will be stored in the Altinn 3 store, while Altinn 2 will simply call Altinn 3. Receipts will no longer be stored in Altinn 2, instead a pseudo receipt (with receiptId 0) will be generated from Altinn 3 Metadata in the relevant Broker-specific operations. The Receipt endpoint in Altinn 2 will as such no longer be able to be used to access receipts for Broker, as they do not exist.. If you require the use of Receipt endpoint, please submit a feature request with detailed examples and we will look into a solution. The use of Manifest file in the submitted file data is deprecated in Altinn 3; but you may enable functionality for Manifest files in the transition solution. See description below for details. Switch Over - What to expect When the Altinn 3 Broker Transition Solution feature is enabled in Altinn 2, the following occurs:\nServiceOwners can request that Altinn 2 Broker Services be transitioned to Altinn 3 Resources. End users that use these services will then transmit data to Altinn 3 instead of Altinn 2 data stores. Files that were available in Altinn 2 for the Broker Service will no longer be available. All new files and status changes will occur in the Altinn 3 Broker Service Solution. ServiceOwners with transitioned Broker Services will have to manage changes in access rights in both Altinn 3 and Altinn 2 simultaneously, as these are not automatically synchronized. Manifest file Due to the manifest files being deprecated in Altinn 3, we have added a feature to enable creation/update of manifest files for the transition solution. The feature is implemented as part of the Download operation from the Altinn 2 side, and due to greater performance impact, is disabled by default. To enable this feature you need to configure the Altinn 3 Resource with the properties:\nUseManifestFileShim = true ExternalServiceCodeLegacy = The External Service Code of the Altinn 2 legacy service, this is only used to build the Manifest xml, and will not affect any other functionality. ExternalServiceEditionCodeLegacy = The External Service Edition Code of the Altinn 2 legacy service, this is only used to build the Manifest xml, and will not affect any other functionality. The manifest file is created based upon the \u0026ldquo;PropertyList\u0026rdquo; specified when initializing a file transfer, as well ExternalServiceCodeLegacy and ExternalServiceEditionCodeLegacy specified on the Resource. The optional list \u0026ldquo;FileList\u0026rdquo; will no longer be created as part of the manifest.\nExample Manifest file:\n\u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;utf-16\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;BrokerServiceManifest xmlns:xsd=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\u0026#34; xmlns:xsi=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\u0026#34; xmlns=\u0026#34;http://schema.altinn.no/services/ServiceEngine/Broker/2015/06\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ExternalServiceCode\u0026gt;4752\u0026lt;/ExternalServiceCode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ExternalServiceEditionCode\u0026gt;1\u0026lt;/ExternalServiceEditionCode\u0026gt; \u0026lt;SendersReference\u0026gt;ref:1245\u0026lt;/SendersReference\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Reportee\u0026gt;837884942\u0026lt;/Reportee\u0026gt; \u0026lt;SentDate\u0026gt;2024-10-18T08:43:48.453\u0026lt;/SentDate\u0026gt; \u0026lt;FileList /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyList\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyKey\u0026gt;senderPhone\u0026lt;/PropertyKey\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyValue\u0026gt;12345678\u0026lt;/PropertyValue\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyKey\u0026gt;senderName\u0026lt;/PropertyKey\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyValue\u0026gt;Ola Normann\u0026lt;/PropertyValue\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyKey\u0026gt;messageType\u0026lt;/PropertyKey\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyValue\u0026gt;SignedMortgageDeed\u0026lt;/PropertyValue\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyKey\u0026gt;notificationMode\u0026lt;/PropertyKey\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyValue\u0026gt;AltinnNotification\u0026lt;/PropertyValue\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyKey\u0026gt;senderEmail\u0026lt;/PropertyKey\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyValue\u0026gt;ola.normann@norge.no\u0026lt;/PropertyValue\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyKey\u0026gt;coverLetter\u0026lt;/PropertyKey\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyValue\u0026gt;XmlAttached\u0026lt;/PropertyValue\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Property\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/PropertyList\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/BrokerServiceManifest\u0026gt; "

This means all receipts returned will be pseudo-receipts, and all receiptIds will be 0.\nIf your use case requires receipt usage, please submit a feature request.\nOutbox (Sender) Rest operations for Broker in Altinn 2 are logically split between Sender and Recipient (outbox / inbox).\nInitiate and Send File Altinn 2 Rest operations combine initiation and upload into the same call. The call consists of a Post request with a file as a binary body and filename and BrokerServiceDescription added as parameters.\nHeader\nPOST https://www.altinn.no/api/{who}/brokerservice/outbox?fileName={fileName}\u0026amp;brokerServiceDescription={\u0026#34;ServiceCode\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;{serviceCode}\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;ServiceEditionCode\u0026#34;:{serviceEdition},\u0026#34;Recipients\u0026#34;:[\u0026#34;{recipient1}\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;{recipient2}\u0026#34;],\u0026#34;SendersReference\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;{sendersReference}}\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Properties\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;{name1}\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;{value1}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;{name2}\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;{value2}\u0026#34;},\u0026#34;FileList\u0026#34;:null} accept: application/json ApiKey: myKey Content-Type: application/zip BrokerServiceDescription example\n{ \u0026#34;ServiceCode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;5678\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ServiceEditionCode\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;SendersReference\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;somereference\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Recipients\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;974760673\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;somethingservicespecific\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;somevalue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;somethingelseservicespecific\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;someothervalue\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;FileList\u0026#34;: null } Differences The transition service does not use the FileList property. No change is necessary from the End User implementation, but a NULL value will be accepted, and any values submitted will be discarded by the transition service. The returned receipt will not be a real receipt, but a pseudo-receipt built from the Altinn 3 Broker File metadata.\nSince the Upload, and Upload processing of the file is an asynchronous process in Altinn 3, the immediate Receipt status received from the call will not necessarily reflect the final state of the file. In addition, the Rest implementation of Altinn 2 Broker services synchronized the initiation and upload of the file, as a result of this the File Status requests do not include statuses for Failed files, since these would not historically be created in the first place.\nIf possible, you should therefore consider adding steps that make calls to Get File Receipt to ensure that the file has been successfully processed.\nExample of immediately returned status from InitiateAndUploadFile call:\n{ \u0026#34;ServiceCode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4947\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ServiceEditionCode\u0026#34;: 4678, \u0026#34;FileName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn2FileName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;FileReference\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1540b8dd-bb90-42d1-a95e-12e097823070\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;FileSize\u0026#34;: 123, \u0026#34;FileStatus\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Initialized\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ReceiptID\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;Sender\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;312903369\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SentDate\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2024-04-26T13:17:33.911\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SendersReference\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SendersReferenceValue\u0026#34; } Example of returned status from a subsequent GetFileDetails calls\n{ \u0026#34;ServiceCode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4947\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ServiceEditionCode\u0026#34;: 4678, \u0026#34;FileName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn2FileName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;FileReference\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1540b8dd-bb90-42d1-a95e-12e097823070\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;FileSize\u0026#34;: 123, \u0026#34;FileStatus\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Uploaded\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ReceiptID\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;Sender\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;312903369\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SentDate\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2024-04-26T13:17:33.911\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SendersReference\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SendersReferenceValue\u0026#34; } \u0026ldquo;Uploaded\u0026rdquo; state here means that the file has been processed OK.

Dette må derfor ikke ansees som en fasit pr nå\nI mange tilfeller er det mulig å registrere andre organisasjoner i en eller flere roller på virksomheten. Altinn vil i mange tilfeller da sørge for en knytning mellom disse virksomhetene slik at person som har bestemte roller i tilknyttet organisasjon da få fullmakter på vegne av den aktuelle virksomheten. Vi kaller dette nøsting av fullmakter.\nHvem får fullmakt på vegne av tilknyttet virksomhet Det er tilknyttet virksomhet og personer reigstrert med nøkkelroller i denne som får fullmakter på vegne av den aktuelle virksomheten. I tabeller på denne siden finner du oversikt over hvilke nøkkelroller som finnes på ulike organisasjonsformer.\nEksempel 1 på hvordan det fungerer:\n\u0026ldquo;Bergen AS\u0026rdquo; registrerer \u0026ldquo;Trondheim AS\u0026rdquo; i rollen som daglig leder Kari er daglig leder for \u0026ldquo;Trondheim AS\u0026rdquo; I dette eksemplet vil Kari få fullmakter på vegne av \u0026ldquo;Bergen AS\u0026rdquo;. Kari vil kunne opptre på vegne av \u0026ldquo;Bergen AS\u0026rdquo; med samme fullmakter som en daglig leder.\nEksempel 2 på hvordan det fungerer:\n\u0026ldquo;Bergen AS\u0026rdquo; registrerer \u0026ldquo;Trondheim AS\u0026rdquo; i rollen som daglig leder \u0026ldquo;Trondheim AS\u0026rdquo; oppretter en virksomhetsbruker og denne gis fullmakten \u0026ldquo;Fullmakt for leverandør\u0026rdquo; (ECKEY-role) på vegne av \u0026ldquo;Trondheim AS\u0026rdquo; I dette eksemplet vil virksomhetsbruker få fullmakter på vegne av \u0026ldquo;Bergen AS\u0026rdquo; gjennom sin knytning til \u0026ldquo;Trondheim AS\u0026rdquo;. Virksomhetsbruker vil kunne opptre på vegne av \u0026ldquo;Bergen AS\u0026rdquo; med samme fullmater som en daglig leder.\nFor hvor mange ledd nøstes fullmakter videre? Altinn nøster fullmakter kun i ett ledd.\nEksempel på hvordan det fungerer:\n\u0026ldquo;Bergen AS\u0026rdquo; registrerer \u0026ldquo;Trondheim AS\u0026rdquo; i rollen som daglig leder Daglig leder for \u0026ldquo;Trondheim AS\u0026rdquo; er \u0026ldquo;Oslo AS\u0026rdquo; Ola er daglig leder for \u0026ldquo;Oslo AS\u0026rdquo; I dette tilfellet vil ikke Ola få fullmakter på vegne av \u0026ldquo;Bergen AS\u0026rdquo;.\nHva med underenheter? Det registreres ikke roller direkte på underenheter (AAFY og BEDR) i Enhetsregisteret. Derfor styres tilgang på vegne av en underenhet gjennom roller registert på hovedenhet i Enhetsregisteret.\nEks 1\n\u0026ldquo;Avdeling Salhus\u0026rdquo; er knyttet til aksjeselskapet \u0026ldquo;Brønnøysund AS\u0026rdquo; Kari er registert som daglig leder for \u0026ldquo;Brønnøysund AS\u0026rdquo; I dette tilfellet vil Kari få samme fullmakter for \u0026ldquo;Avdeling Salhus\u0026rdquo; som hun har for \u0026ldquo;Brønnøysund AS\u0026rdquo; Eks 2\n\u0026ldquo;Avdeling Salhus\u0026rdquo; er knyttet til aksjeselskapet \u0026ldquo;Brønnøysund AS\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Regnskap AS\u0026rdquo; er registert som regnskapsfører for \u0026ldquo;Brønnøysund AS\u0026rdquo; Ola er daglig leder for \u0026ldquo;Regnskap AS\u0026rdquo; I dette tilfellet vil Ola få regnskapsfullmakter på vegne av \u0026ldquo;Avdeling salhus\u0026rdquo; og \u0026ldquo;Brønnøysund AS\u0026rdquo; Hva med regnskapsfører og revisor for Enkeltpersonforetak? Enkeltpersonforetak er spesielle på den måten at det er innehaver selv som er 100% ansvarlig for virksomheten. Derfor får nøstes enkelte fullmakter videre til innehavers personnummer for regnskapsfører og revisor\nEks:\nKari har registert et ENK kalt \u0026ldquo;Kari sitt ENK\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Rgnskap AS\u0026rdquo; er registert regnskapsfører for \u0026ldquo;Kari ENK\u0026rdquo; Ola er daglig leder for \u0026ldquo;Regnskap AS\u0026rdquo; I dette tilfellet vil Ola få regnskapsfullmakter på vegne av \u0026ldquo;Kari sitt ENK\u0026rdquo; og på vegne av Kari som person.

See the Client Delegation API documentation.\nAutomatic Client Relationships Some client relationships are created automatically based on roles registered in the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities (Enhetsregisteret).

These packages must align with the roles you have in the Central Coordinating Register.\nNote: Access packages with client relationships only work for \u0026ldquo;AND\u0026rdquo; cases. This means that if a system user for client relationships has multiple access packages, the client must have either directly delegated or received delegation through the ER role for all packages for the system user to function. For example: If the system user for client relationships has both the agriculture package and the accountant package, the client must have explicitly delegated the agriculture package (directly delegated) in addition to having received delegation for the accountant package through the ER role (which comes automatically).\nIn the Altinn Portal Go to the overview of system accesses Select system access Click \u0026ldquo;Add clients\u0026rdquo; Select clients (one, several, or all) Click confirm and close "

	"description": "This guide shows how you, as an end-user system vendor, can create a system user for your own system and a system user for a client system.",
	"content": "Target Audience: Developers and system integrators at an End-User System Vendor (SBSL) who will be integrating their system with the Altinn platform.\nPrerequisites:\nYou must have some prerequisites in place before you create system user, see the Getting Started guide.\n1. Create System User for Own System This applies to a system user for your own system, where the system acts on behalf of the end-user organization. This can be done in two ways.\nMethod A: Vendor-controlled Creation This is the preferred method where you, as the SBSL, initiate the creation via API.\nInitiate request: Send an HTTP POST request to the API endpoint.\nTest (TT02): https://platform.tt02.altinn.no/authentication/api/v1/systemuser/request/vendor Production: https://platform.altinn.no/authentication/api/v1/systemuser/request/vendor Configure Request Body: Include a JSON body that specifies the system, customer, and access rights (accesspackage).\n{ \u0026#34;systemId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;991825827_smartcloud\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;partyOrgNo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;314248295\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rights\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;resource\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ske-krav-og-betalinger\u0026#34; } ] } ], \u0026#34;accessPackages\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;urn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:accesspackage:skattegrunnlag\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;redirectUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://smartcloudxxxx/receipt\u0026#34; } Receive response: The API validates the request. Upon success, you will receive a JSON response with status: \u0026quot;New\u0026quot;.\nGet deep link: From the response, retrieve the value of confirmUrl. Example response:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;505f8488-3d48-4c15-8e21-35cb9432f815\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;New\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;confirmUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://am.ui.tt02.altinn.no/accessmanagement/ui/systemuser/request?id=...\u0026#34; } ``` Relay link: Provide the confirmUrl deep link to the end-user in a secure manner (e.g., directly in your software).\nEnd-user approves: The end-user must follow the link to approve the System User. The request will then get the status Accepted.\nMethod B: User-controlled Creation This method is only relevant if you, as the SBSL, do not have your own interface to handle vendor-controlled creation.\nInstruct end-user: Ask the end-user to perform the following: Go to the Altinn portal. Navigate to system user creation. Select your system from the dropdown list. (You must inform the customer what your system is named in the list). Automatic approval: When the user completes the process, they automatically approve all the predefined access rights the system needs. Retrieve token: After the user is created, you (SBSL) can retrieve the system user token needed for the integration. 2. Create System User for Client System This applies to a system user for a system that will act on behalf of the end-user\u0026rsquo;s clients (e.g., an accounting system).\nKey differences:\nOnly vendor-controlled creation is possible. You can only specify required access via accessPackages, not rights. After approval, an additional manual step is required from the end-user. Instructions (Vendor-controlled Creation) Initiate request: Send an HTTP POST request to the specific endpoint for client systems (vendor/agent/).\nTest (TT02): POST https://platform.tt02.altinn.no/authentication/api/v1/systemuser/request/vendor/agent/ Production: POST https://platform.altinn.no/authentication/api/v1/systemuser/request/vendor/agent/ Configure Request Body: Include a JSON body. Note that the rights list must be empty or omitted.\n{ \u0026#34;systemId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;312605031_SuperRegnskap\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;partyOrgNo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;310495670\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;accessPackages\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;urn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:accesspackage:ansvarlig-revisor\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;redirectUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://superregnskap.no\u0026#34; } This request presupposes that a System exists in the System Registry with the systemId \u0026ldquo;312605031_SuperRegnskap\u0026rdquo; and the access package \u0026ldquo;ansvarlig revisor\u0026rdquo; (responsible auditor) beforehand.\nReceive response: Receive a JSON response with status: \u0026quot;New\u0026quot; and a confirmUrl, similar to the process for \u0026ldquo;own system\u0026rdquo;.\nRelay link: Provide the confirmUrl deep link to the end-user in a secure manner.\nEnd-user approves: The end-user follows the link and approves the request. (See Approve System User). The status is set to Accepted.\n(Required) End-user delegates clients: After the system user is approved, the end-user must manually log in to Altinn and delegate the clients (i.e., the organizations to be reported on behalf of) to the newly created system user. (See Delegate Clients).\n3. Verification and Status Verify Creation After an end-user has approved a request (status Accepted), you as the SBSL can verify that the system user exists.\nSend an HTTP GET request to: {{API_BASE_URL}}/authentication/api/v1/systemuser/vendor/byquery?system-id={systemId}\u0026amp;orgno={customerOrgno} (Replace {API_BASE_URL}, {systemId} and {customerOrgno})\nA successful response returns JSON with details about the system user, including the system user id and userType.\nRequest Status A request has a lifecycle defined by its status:\nNew: Newly created request, awaiting user action. Accepted: The end-user has approved the request. Rejected: The end-user has clicked \u0026ldquo;Do not approve\u0026rdquo;. TimedOut: The request was not answered within 10 days and has expired. It is no longer available via the API. Denied: Not in use.

This applies to cases where there is no established client relationship in the Brønnøysund Registers. It is the clients themselves who grant this authorization to the organization that owns the system access.\nPrerequisites You must have access to Altinn as Client Administrator or Managing Director. Process in the Altinn portal Log in as the Managing Director of the organization that is to be added as a client in a system access for clients. In this example, we use \u0026ldquo;Klientkunde AS\u0026rdquo; as the client. Go to Users in the menu, if you are not already on this page. Click + New user to establish a client relationship. Enter the organization number of the organization you want to grant authorization to. In this example, we enter the organization number of \u0026ldquo;DISKRET NÆR TIGER AS\u0026rdquo;, which we used in the example above. Click Add organization. You have now created a relationship between \u0026ldquo;Klientkunde AS\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;DISKRET NÆR TIGER AS\u0026rdquo;, but without having granted any authorizations to \u0026ldquo;DISKRET NÆR TIGER AS\u0026rdquo; yet.

In this example, we want to grant authorization to the access package \u0026ldquo;Skattegrunnlag\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;DISKRET NÆR TIGER AS\u0026rdquo;, so we search for \u0026ldquo;Skattegrunnlag\u0026rdquo;. Click Grant authorization on the access package \u0026ldquo;Skattegrunnlag\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;DISKRET NÆR TIGER AS\u0026rdquo; has now been granted authorization to the access package \u0026ldquo;Skattegrunnlag\u0026rdquo;. You have now established a client relationship that can be used for the system access. After you have established the client relationship through these steps, \u0026ldquo;Klientkunde AS\u0026rdquo; can be added to a system access for clients that is configured with the access package \u0026ldquo;Skattegrunnlag\u0026rdquo;.

Default is true. maxHeight - sets number of lines before overflowing text is hidden with an ellipsis (\u0026hellip;). \u0026quot;maxHeight\u0026quot;: 0 results in turning off linebreaking. editInTable - set to true to enable editing of the component in the table view. Default is false. See more about this in the section describing this functionality. showInExpandedEdit - set to false to hide the component in the expanded edit view. Default is true. See more about this in the section describing this functionality. Example:\n{ ... \u0026#34;tableHeaders\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;streetAdress\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;postalNumber\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;tableColumns\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;streetAdress\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;width\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;20%\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alignText\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;left\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textOverflow\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lineWrap\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;maxHeight\u0026#34;: 1 } }, \u0026#34;postalNumber\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;alignText\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;right\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;city\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;width\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;auto\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alignText\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;left\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textOverflow\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lineWrap\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;maxHeight\u0026#34;: 3 } } }, ... } Example for column options Sticky table headers v4 (App Frontend) The table headers can be made sticky by setting the stickyHeaders property to true. This will make the headers stick to the top of the table when scrolling. This is useful for tables with a lot of rows, where the headers are not visible when scrolling down.\nExample for sticky header Showing components directly in the table It is possible to show components directly in the table view. This is done by setting editInTable to true for the component in question, via the tableColumns property. This is useful for components and groups that are not very complex, and where it is not necessary to show the component in the expanded edit view. Visually, this can make the repeating group functionality resemble some configurations of the Grid component, but allows the user to add/remove rows from the table - and allows for storing the data in a repeating structure in the data model.\nExample of editing in table There are several levels of configuration to allow editing in the table. It is possible to allow a combination of editing in the table and editing in the expanded edit view. It is also possible to hide some components in the expanded edit view and only allow editing in the table.\nEditing all fields in table If you want to set up a repeating group where all possible fields should be editable in the table, there is a shortcut for this. By setting edit.mode to onlyTable, all fields in the table will be editable. Note that not all components that can be shown in a repeating group are supported in the table. See a full list of components that are supported in table mode in the documentation for the Grid component.\nExample The example above shows a repeating group configuration where all fields are editable in the table. Note that the button for editing a row disappears in this mode, since all fields are editable directly in the table.\nEditing some fields in table It is also possible to set up a repeating group where some fields are editable in the table, while others are only editable in the expanded edit view. This is done by setting editInTable to true for the components that should be editable in the table, and showInExpandedEdit to false for the components that should be hidden in the expanded edit view. See details on how to set this up in the documentation for tableColumns above.\nExample The example above shows a repeating group configuration where some fields are only editable in the table (first name and last name), one component is editable in both the table and the expanded edit view (age), and the last component is only editable in the expanded edit view (address).\nThe Group component configuration for the example above is as follows:\nv4 (App Frontend) { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myRepeatingGroup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;RepeatingGroup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;fornavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;etternavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alder\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fullt-navn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;adresse\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;tableHeaders\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;fornavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;etternavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alder\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;tableColumns\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;fornavn\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;editInTable\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;showInExpandedEdit\u0026#34;: false }, \u0026#34;etternavn\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;editInTable\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;showInExpandedEdit\u0026#34;: false }, \u0026#34;alder\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;editInTable\u0026#34;: true } }, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;add_button\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;person\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;RepGroup.Personer\u0026#34; } } v3 (App Frontend) { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myRepeatingGroup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;fornavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;etternavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alder\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fullt-navn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;adresse\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;tableHeaders\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;fornavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;etternavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alder\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;tableColumns\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;fornavn\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;editInTable\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;showInExpandedEdit\u0026#34;: false }, \u0026#34;etternavn\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;editInTable\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;showInExpandedEdit\u0026#34;: false }, \u0026#34;alder\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;editInTable\u0026#34;: true } }, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 99999, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;add_button\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;person\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;RepGroup.Personer\u0026#34; } } "

In the Resource Register, rules can be created specifying who can use a service, for what purpose, and under which conditions. If a service should only be available to a specific group of organizations, this can be managed through access lists. With the authorization service (PDP), the resource owner can ensure access control over the resource. This access control supports users from both ID-porten and Maskinporten.\nSystem-vendors can use our APIs to authenticate their users against public services.\nEnd-user can act on behalf of an organization or themselves. In the Altinn portal or via an end-user system, the user can select whom they are acting on behalf of. The end user can view which authorizations exist and who has authorization on their behalf. Authorizations can be granted or revoked via both the user interface and API.\nAuthentication Altinn Authorization provides authentication functionality using ID-porten and Maskinporten against Altinn.

	"content": "Microsoft Azure as service provider Altinn 3 runs on Microsoft Azure, which is one of the largest cloud service providers, in data centers in Norway.\nRunning in the cloud has both advantages and disadvantages. What happens if the connection between the data centers in Norway and the remote management location goes down? How do cloud services function in times of peace, crisis, and war?\n⚠ Service owners must consider operational requirements during crisis situations. Microsoft invests heavily in security, not only in the technology they develop but also in documentation and tools for using their solutions securely. More information on this can be found on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Trust Center.\nThe Trust Center also contains information about certifications and audits.\nThe relationship between cloud providers and governments is discussed in the DPIA.\n\u0026ldquo;Common\u0026rdquo; security challenges in the cloud and how they are addressed Misconfiguration One of the biggest security challenges when using the cloud is misconfiguration, which can lead to for example data leaks. There may be several reasons why a cloud service is misconfigured. The service may have default settings that allow the service to be open. There have been several examples in the media where there have been data leaks because storage services have not been configured to require authentication (and authorization).\nDigdir thinks security in depth is important. Most services are set up to require both authentication and correct network affiliation.\nResponsibility distribution There are clear boundaries on what is the responsibility of the customer (here Digdir) and what is the responsibility of Azure. The \u0026ldquo;Shared responsibility model\u0026rdquo; diagram shows how responsibility is distributed.\nFigure 1 - Responsibility shared between customer and cloud provider (Azure) Resource control The properties of the cloud allow for almost instantaneous provisioning of resources. Uncontrolled provisioning (and scaling) leads to financial loss. Decommissioning is also almost instantaneous, which can result in loss of data and capacity.\nBoth organizational and technical measures have been introduced to reduce these risks.\nEncryption as protection against the cloud provider NSM\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Frequently Asked Questions about Cloud and Service Outsourcing\u0026rdquo; discusses the issue of using encryption to protect against the cloud provider. Since the cloud provider has control over the hypervisor layer, the cloud provider will also have access to encryption keys in memory or the keys used to access an external HSM service. The only known method of protection would be to keep all encryption, including key management, outside the effective control of the cloud provider.\nDigdir has evaluated Microsoft Azure\u0026rsquo;s regime for key management, certifications, and third-party audits. Keeping all encryption and key management outside the effective control of the cloud provider would significantly impair the benefits of using cloud services.\nBased on available information from Microsoft Azure, certifications, and third-party audit reports, we believe that we can trust Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s handling of this. The opposite would in practice imply that we had no confidence in our chosen provider - and then there would be no basis for continuing the contractual relationship. The general risks associated with such encryption, key management, and information security in general are taken into account in a more thorough ROS analysis and an overall assessment of the supplier as a data processor.\nDigdir/Altinn has accepted this risk.\n⚠ Service owners must evaluate the use of Azure as a subcontractor. What about Schrems II? If personal data is to be transferred from the EU/EEA to a third country, such as the USA, there must be a legal basis for the transfer according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A widely used basis for transferring personal data to the USA was an agreement called the EU-US Privacy Shield. In the Schrems II ruling of 2020, this agreement was declared invalid.\nHowever, on July 10, 2023, a new framework for transferring personal data between the EU and the USA was introduced through an adequacy decision that took immediate effect. An adequacy decision is a decision by the EU Commission stating that an area outside the EU and EEA has rules that safeguard privacy in a manner comparable to that of EU and EEA countries. If the EU Commission has made such a decision, personal data can be transferred to the area in accordance with the decision, and the transfer will be comparable to transfers within the EEA. It is important to note that other requirements of data protection regulations must be followed, such as having a legal basis for processing and a data processing agreement if necessary. It is also important to assess subcontractors to see if they are certified and if they are located in third countries other than the USA, as this adequacy decision only applies to transfers to the USA.\nThis new framework, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, is a self-certification system where US businesses can become certified if they commit to processing personal data in accordance with the framework and provided they offer free and independent complaint mechanisms for individuals. If personal data is transferred to a certified US business, no other legal basis than this adequacy decision is required. It is also not necessary to assess the level of protection in the USA or to implement security measures. This specific interpretation of the effect of the adequacy decision is adopted by the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.\nMicrosoft Corporation is certified, and therefore the adequacy decision is a valid legal basis for any transfer of personal data from the EU/EEA to the USA. Microsoft Azure, like other cloud providers, extensively uses subcontractors and third parties, such as support centers in various locations worldwide. The Standard terms and conditions are designed so that the customer generally consents in advance to the provider using such subcontractors/sub-processors.\nAs mentioned, Altinn 3 runs on Azure in Norwegian data centers. Data storage related to running services and end-users is done in Norway. Support may be provided in several different ways. Digdir will primarily use support services provided within Norway and the EU/EEA. It is Digdir itself that controls when and if to contact support personnel and what support providers should see and have access to.\nFurthermore, we refer to the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) carried out for Altinn 3. Digdir has made its assessments of Altinn in the roles of data controller and data processor for personal data. However, service owners, the businesses using Altinn, are the data controllers for the processing of personal data in their services—as well as for their employees\u0026rsquo; and consultants\u0026rsquo; use of Altinn and support tools. It is therefore important to specify that the service owners themselves must make their own assessments for their use and their specific services in their role as data controllers.\n"

	"content": "Methodology Digdir follows a secure development methodology for the development and operation of Altinn 3, where security is an important element in every phase of the process. Each DevOps team has a Security Champion/Security Coordinator with special focus on security in the team. The Security Coordinator also participates in the security group in the BOD department at Digdir, where issues and areas are discussed. The development process is continuously improved.\nFigure 2 - Secure DevOps To be able to put the developers in focus, the use of security tools and automation is preferred where possible. This includes integration with security tools in the build and deploy processes where identified security flaws stop the processes.\nAltinn has several important architecture principles that support security:\nOpen source Promotes openness and the possibility for service owners and others to quality-assure the source code Use known, modern, and popular frameworks and technologies Prefer standards rather than creating something themselves Isolation Prefer managed services (PaaS) over IaaS services Defense in depth More information about the principles can be found at https://docs.altinn.studio/technology/architecture/principles/\nThird-party vendors and supply chains Figure 3 - Frameworks and technologies used in Altinn 3 Altinn 3 is based on open source code and uses several third-party libraries and products. These libraries, in turn, use other libraries, which again use other libraries, and so on. This creates long supply chains that are difficult to oversee and control. There will also be different developers/teams/organizations behind the libraries. Transfer of ownership of a library can also be transferred to a person/team with a completely different motivation than the original owner. There have been examples where owners have withdrawn the library, which has led to downtime for many websites, or new owners have introduced functionality with malicious intent.\nMaintaining a manual overview of these libraries would be an insurmountable task. Therefore, Digdir uses \u0026ldquo;Dependabot\u0026rdquo; and other GitHub security features to monitor third-party libraries for updates and vulnerabilities, in addition to having routines for doing continous patching and evaluation of dependencies.\n⚠ Service owners must monitor and update their use of third-party libraries in their apps themselves.

The principles are document as suggested by TOGAF.\nThe architecture principles below is described like TOGAF recommends.\nFree and open-source software Principle\nThe components and solutions in Altinn 3 are Free and Open Source.\nRationale\nPossibility to share the platform as Open Source. The possibility to create an Open Source community around the platform.\nImplications\nCode developed is shared on GitHub. See License. We also have our backlog on GitHub. Can\u0026rsquo;t use closed source products in the platform Can\u0026rsquo;t use products with licensing limiting use and modifications Others can easily reuse, modify and improve our components and solutions Web Standards Principle\nUse Web Standards.\nRationale\nCan use standard tools and developers does not need to have special skills to develop components in the platform or applications to run on the platform.\nImplications\nFormats and frameworks used need to follow standards We use JWT in authentication cookies Build with modern and popular frameworks Principle\nWhen choosing between different technology with similar capabilites, select the most modern and popular framework.\nRationale\nThe project is open source and it is a big advantage to build the solution on open source technology that developers love to use. This gives better access to resources with the needed competency.\nImplications\nWe build the frontend using React and ASP.NET Core, the 2 most loved web frameworks. We use .NET Core, the framework that developers love the most We use Linux and Docker containers in Kubernetes, the 3 most loved platforms. We use Visual Studio Code, the most loved development environment. Favor standards over custom Principle\nWhenever we need to store information we favor standard formats for that information over creating a custom format.\nRationale\nStandard formats are documented and is some cases it exists 3. party tools to edit information.\nImplications\nWe use BPMN 2.0 to define the process for applications We use XACML 3.0 to define authorization policies for applications We use JSON as general format. Isolation Principle We should try isolate application and data own by one organization from others.\nRationale\nReduce risk for one organization affecting service for another organization.\nImplications\nSeperate Kubernetes Clusters for each organization Seperate data store for each organization Design and build for Public Cloud Principle\nThe solutions should be deployed to a public cloud solution. The architecture need to support that.\nRationale\nUsing public cloud infrastructure from one of the big vendors gives cost savings, the team can be more agile and the solutions can take scale.\nImplications\nAdditional security measures Need to build knowledge about cloud solutions Limit cloud lock-in Principle\nThe architecture should try to avoid technology that locks the platform to a specific public cloud vendor. But not for all costs. In many cases it would still make sense to choose a managed service only available in a given public cloud.\nRationale\nThe goal with this principle is that it should be possible to move the solution to a different cloud provider without needing to build everything from scratch.\nImplications\nDocker and Kubernetes is used for containers and orhecstration of containers. We use document databases and BLOBS for storing data. Everything talks through APIs. Build as microservices Principle\nThe platform is built as microservices. Related functionality is grouped in to seperate applications and deployed as containers. Apps created in Altinn Studio will be deployed as microservices/apps.\nRationale\nThe different components can be scaled differently, it can be deployed independently. Reduced deploy time. Different teams can be responsible for different microservices/apps.\nImplications\nFunctionality in Altinn Platform is seperated in Authentication, Authorization, Profile, Storage, Pdf and Register components Applications created in Altinn Studio is deployed as microapps to Altinn Apps Design for automation Principle\nThe component should be created in a way that they support automation in development, deployment and operations.\nRationale\nReduce the required effort to develop and operate the platform.\nImplications\nWe use Continuous integration We use Continuous deployment We build Infrastructure as code We use Automatic scaling We monitor and do automatic recovery of components Favor managed services Principle\nWe should use manages cloud services when possible.\nRationale\nReduce effort needed to host and scale the platform.\nImplications\nUse managed PostgreSQL in Azure for Gitea Use managed CosmosDB as document database Use Azure blob storage for storing data Use Azure Kubernets Services to manage the Kubernetes Clusters Use Azure Api Management as API-management platform Security in depth Principle\nAll components should authenticate and authorize requests.\nRationale\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t trust other components.\nImplications\nComponents in Altinn Platform authenticates and authorize end user even if the request comes throug a application that also require the same We use API management to control traffic between Altinn Apps and Altinn Platform. Cross-platform Principle\nThe components in the platform should be cross platform and can run on Microsoft Windows, Linux and MacOs.\nRationale\nDevelopers should be able to create applications on any platform, and our platform should never be locked to a single operating system or processor-architecture.\nImplications\nWe use .NET Core or Java to build components. Container technology Principle\nApplications should be deployed as containers.\nRationale\nThe rationale to use containers is that we get a consistent runtime environment that can run anywhere. Isolate runtime environment. Consistency.\nImplications\nDeploy and run applications/components in docker containers. "

	"description": "The Altinn consent functionality is a technical solution for sharing data from a service owner to a data consumer based on the consent of the individual or organisation the information concerns.",
	"content": "\nDepending on the purpose and content of the consent, it can give the service owner both the necessary legal basis for sharing data in line with the Personal Data Act/GDPR and consent for, for example, lifting statutory confidentiality.\nWhat do you get with consent in Altinn 3? An end-to-end consent process where Altinn manages the dialogue between end user, data consumer, and service owner. A single Maskinporten consent token that contains everything you need to validate and log the delegation. An improved end-user experience with an upgraded consent screen and clearer information flow. Flexible support for third-party vendors that can administer consent on behalf of the data consumer. Built-in controls for access lists, duration, and revocation so users and service owners stay in control of shared data. What\u0026rsquo;s new in Altinn 3? The consent process in Altinn 2 works well, so we have aimed to change it as little as possible to keep the transition to Altinn 3 simple. To make the experience even smoother for everyone involved, we have still introduced some improvements.\nSimplified token handling: Only one Maskinporten token is used, containing all the information about the consent. New token format: API providers must update their validation code to interpret the new format. The format is described in the guides for both service owners and data consumers. Improved user experience: End users meet an upgraded and more user-friendly interface. Support for vendors: Option to use third-party vendors to manage the consent process. How the consent process works Actors End user Individual or organisation that grants consent.\nData consumer Organisation (e.g. a bank) that requests access to data. Service owner (Data source) Public entity that owns the data. [\nProcess flow The end user starts a service where the data consumer needs to fetch data from a public service → initiates the consent flow. The data consumer sends a consent request to Altinn. Altinn returns a redirect_url → the user is sent there to approve. The user authenticates and grants consent (delegation). The data consumer retrieves the consent token (consent_id). The data consumer uses the token to fetch data from the service owner (data source). Vis/skjul innhold Detailed process flow Step Description Technical action Comment 1. Start the service End user starts the consent process via the data consumer (e.g. the bank’s site) User clicks “Request consent” Data consumer initiates the flow 2. Create request Data consumer creates a consent request in Altinn POST /api/consentRequests with parameters (CoveredBy, OfferedBy, RedirectUrl, etc.) Requires enterprise authentication (Maskinporten) 3. Redirect to Altinn Data consumer sends the end user to Altinn’s consent form Redirect to a GUI link that contains consentRequestId User reviews and approves the request 4. Perform delegation User approves the consent in Altinn Altinn registers the delegation and updates the consent status User signs in via ID-porten 5. Fetch consent token Data consumer fetches a consent token after approval GET /api/consentTokens/{consent_id} Token confirms that consent has been granted 6. Fetch data Data consumer uses the consent token to access data from the service owner API call to the service owner with the token in the header Service owner validates the token and returns data Technical requirements Enterprise authentication Data consumers must authenticate via Maskinporten with the correct scopes.\nTo use consent, the data consumer needs the following tokens:\naltinn:consentrequests.read altinn:consentrequests.write In addition to this, each individual service owner must grant the necessary tokens for their service. The service owner is responsible for documenting the necessary tokens for their service, as well as how the data consumer can be granted these.\nAccess lists Service owners can control which organisations are allowed to use the service with access lists.\nValidity Consents must have a defined duration.\nRevocation The user can withdraw consent at any time in the Altinn portal.\nUse of Suppliers For data consumers, it is possible to use suppliers (third-party actors) to create consent requests and retrieve data on behalf of the data consumer.\nRequirements for using a supplier:\nScope altinn:consentrequests.write must be delegated to the supplier. The scope for the relevant API must also be delegated to the supplier (e.g., skatteetaten:inntekt). The supplier creates the request on behalf of the data consumer. The user retrieves the consent token and calls the API to fetch data. Note: End users receive information in the GUI that the consent is handled by a supplier.\nThe EBevis Solution For Digdir\u0026rsquo;s EBevis solution, Digdir can request consent on behalf of the data consumer without the scope being delegated to Digdir. This makes it possible for actors such as municipalities to use the solution without having a complete setup in Maskinporten.\nThe EBevis solution has its own scope that allows the creation of consent requests for all organizations for their resources.\nGetting started Read the specific steps you need to complete under Getting Started\n"

Independent Deployment: Simple services are easier to deploy, and since they are autonomous, are less likely to cause system failures when they go wrong. Technology Diversity: With microservices you can mix multiple languages, development frameworks and data-storage technologies. Risk \u0026amp; Issues Distribution: Distributed systems are harder to program, since remote calls are slow and are always at risk of failure. Eventual Consistency: Maintaining strong consistency is extremely difficult for a distributed system, which means everyone has to manage eventual consistency. Operational Complexity: You need a mature operations team to manage lots of services, which are being redeployed regularly. Layered Pattern Overview Applications/Components are organized into horizontal layers, each layer performing a specific role within the application. Typical the layers will typical be Presentation, API, Business and dataacess where dataccess could be access to database or API calls to other components.\nLayered Pattern Conceptual View Benefits Testability.

	"description": "How to build expressions with Altinn Studio.",
	"content": "This documentation will describe how to build expressions connected to component fields using the Expressions tool in Altinn Studio.\nExpressions are a concept in Altinn apps that lets app-developers dynamically assign values to different elements in an application. Please read more in the Expressions section of Apps documentation of what expressions can be used for and how the syntax works.\nTerminology In Altinn Studio the concept is called logic where an expression is addressed as a logic rule.\nExpression: A unit consisting of the boolean component field and the actual expression that will evaluate to be a boolean value when calculated in a running app. The most simple expression can consist of a single sub expression, while a more advanced expression can consist of multiple sub expressions combined with an operator. Sub Expression: A term used to address the most elementary unit of an expression that only consists of a function and two values, whereas a value either can be a single element or a combined element with the first part of the element defining a source where the following value can be found. Property or Field: The boolean property or field of the component that the expression should be connected to. Function: The function that should be used to compare the two values in the sub expression. Data Source: The source for the values in the sub expression. Can also be addressed as the type of the value. Data Source Value: The actual value that should be used to evaluate the sub expression. However, if the value has a data source being application settings, component, data model or instance context, it acts as a reference to a value rather than an explicit value. Operator: The operator will only be relevant when there are more than one sub expression and will be used to evaluate if all the sub expressions should imply (use AND) or if it is enough that only one of the sub expressions implies (use OR). Building expressions in Altinn Studio When building expressions in the Expressions panel in Studio, it is always possible to add one expression for each of the following states:\nhidden required readOnly For group components, also these states can have attached expressions:\nedit.addButton edit.deleteButton edit.saveButton edit.saveAndNextButton If all these fields have expressions added to them you will be shown an info message saying that you have reached the limit for expressions.\nwhen going forward configuring an expression for your component in the Expression tool in Altinn Studio for the first time, follow this guide:\nBasic Expressions Choose a component field to add the expression to\nChoose a function that you want your first sub expression to use\nChoose a data source that you want the first element in your sub expression to be\nThis data source can be either an actual source which will provide you with a set of available values to choose from, or the data source can be a type for a value. The available data sources that will provide you with a set of given values are:\nData Model: Fields from the current selected datamodel Component: All component ids present across layouts Application Settings: All custom configuration values added in the appsettings.json Instance Context: One of the following values that exist on the instance object in Altinn storage; instanceId , InstanceOwnerPartyId or appId While the available data sources that will act as types are:\nString: Lets you assign any custom string as the value Number: Lets you assign any custom number as the value Boolean: Lets you assign the value as true or false Null: Automatically assigns the value ass null WARNING: The given values provided when choosing Application Settings as the data source are not yet implemented.\nChoose a value that you want the first element in your sub expression to have\nChoose a comparable data source and value for the second element in your sub expression\nSave expression or continue adding sub expressions\nSaving the expression will connect the expression to the component property you chose and visualize it in a preview mode. Or you can keep adding sub expression by expanding the rule and set the operator, that should evaluate the sub expressions together, to either and or or. Then you repeat these steps from point 2 - adding a function to the new sub expression and so on. Then you can save the complete expression, with the arbitrary number of sub expressions, and visualize it in preview mode. \u0026ldquo;Complex\u0026rdquo; expressions There is also a possibility for adding expressions by writing them directly in the syntax expected by the configuration of a running Altinn app. This functionality will be enabled in Studio if the expression is manually added to the field through Gitea or an editor IDE and if the expression is written in a way that can not be interpreted by the Studio Expressions tool. This accounts for nested expressions, as well as for expressions that are written in a simplified way, e.g. not including the function, since it will be interpreted by app-frontend implicitly.\nThe possibility to edit the expression by freestyle writing can also be enabled as an option at any given point. However, when editing the expression freestyle you will only be able to switch back to using the Studio tool if you write an expression that can be interpreted by the tool.\nSee that the switch is available to enable freestyle editing: Enable it and see your expression in the freestyle editing text area: Making changes to an invalid (or not-interpretable) expression will disable the switch: Limitations As mentioned there are a few limitations in the Studio tool for configuring expressions.\nAvailable Component Fields Firstly, there are only some component fields that Studio are able to interpret and build connected expressions for. In a later stage of development we will enable building and interpreting expressions connected to\ntext resource bindings on components process Nesting Second, Studio is limited to building expressions with only one level of nesting. This means that a value in a sub expression only can be either an implicit or explicit value and not a sub expression. If the value is a sub expression you will end up with a \u0026ldquo;complex\u0026rdquo; expression as in the example above.\nExisting Boolean properties are lost when adding expressions If you have defined any of the boolean properties/fields on the component to have a boolean value, true or false, and you connect an expression to it, Studio will not remember this value. This means that if you add an expression to a field that originally had a boolean value and you delete the expression, the field will disappear from the component and be evaluated to its default value.\nWhat is a Valid Expression from a Studio Point of View To be allowed to save an expression to the layout file Studio will only visualize the Save button when some conditions imply:\nYou have selected a component property/field that the expression should be connected to You have selected a function for the first sub expression of your expression When these conditions imply you can save the expression without filling in any of the values. This will add an expression looking like this to the given component field:\n\u0026#34;[COMPONENT_PROPERTY]\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;[FUNCTION]\u0026#34;, null, null ] Be aware that the expression will be valid and calculate a boolean value that will have effect on the behaviour of your component. Depending on the chosen function the expression can be calculated to true or false. If the null values would not make sense with the given function the default calculated expression value will be false.\n"

	"content": "A large portion of communication between the public sector and businesses occurs via APIs in Altinn and at other platform providers in the public sector. Much of this communication happens on behalf of the organization and does not need to be performed by a specific person. System User makes it easy to create a user that is granted the necessary authorizations in relation to the tasks it is to perform.\nSystem User builds upon Maskinporten, which provides secure authentication and coarse-grained access control, and extends this with fine-grained access control.\nSystem User makes it easy to set up a virtual user that can operate on behalf of the organization, either as a self-created system or in a customer-supplier relationship. System User can be used both for services running in Altinn and for external services that use Altinn Authorization as their authorization solution.\nSystem User is not intended to replace ID-porten or Maskinporten, but to supplement and extend what is already provided through these components. ID-porten and System User can be used separately or in combination on the same service, depending on the service owner\u0026rsquo;s need to know whether it is a person or a system calling the service.\nWhen you need to link the operations performed with which person is performing them, use ID-Porten.\nWhen you need to link the operations performed with the system behind them, use System User.\nIf you only need to know which organization and any scopes, use Maskinporten.\nFor a high-level functional walkthrough and user journey, see Samarbeidsportalen.\nFeatures with System User System User provides a number of advantages compared to today\u0026rsquo;s enterprise user and end user system concept in Altinn 2.\nFor service owners To support System User on your service, you must choose Maskinporten as the authentication method and make queries against our authorization API (PDP) with the system user information found in the Maskinporten token.\nA detailed guide to get started can be found here\nFor end user system vendors\nSystem User gives you a simple and secure way to create a user that can be used to automate actions on behalf of your customers, without the need to exchange certificates or other secrets. System User supports both customers who work on behalf of themselves in your system and on behalf of clients (accountants, etc.). You can choose whether you want your customers to be able to create System Users from the Altinn portal, or if you want to control and guide them through the process in your end user system. To use System User, you must ensure that the service owner supports this on their service.\nFor more information to get started, see here\nFor end users\nSystem User enables your end user system vendor to perform actions on behalf of your organization in a simple and secure way. At any time, you can see which authorizations you have granted the System User via the Altinn user interface and delete the System User if the vendor no longer needs the authorizations.\nFor more information to get started, see here\nEcosystem Resource Owner The resource owner creates a service in the Resource Registry so that Altinn Authorization can be used for authorization. Furthermore, the resource owner creates or determines which scopes should be used for their service. If the scopes are not public, the resource owner assigns scopes to those who should have access to use the service. When the service is in operation, the resource owner queries Altinn Authorization to determine whether the System User can perform the requested action on behalf of the organization it represents.\nAltinn Authorization Altinn Authorization is the solution that contains information about who can do what, on behalf of whom in the public sector.\nSystem Registry is a registry of end user systems that can request to have a System User created. End user system vendors register metadata about the system here, authorizations the system can request, as well as which Maskinporten client ID the system uses. End user system vendors also choose whether the system can be created via the Altinn user interface or if it happens upon request from the end user system. Systems in the System Registry can be seen as templates for a System User.\nSystem User is a non-personal user that is granted authorizations on behalf of the organization that owns it. The System User can be created upon request from a system vendor or via the Altinn user interface if the end user system vendor has made this available.\nPDP is the service that resource owners call to authorize that the System User can perform the requested action.\nMaskinporten Maskinporten is used for fine- and coarse-grained access control in the solution. The Maskinporten token contains information about:\nThe authentication mechanism for everything related to System Users:\nRegistration of systems in the System Registry (API at Altinn Authorization) Registering System User (API at Altinn Authorization) Submission from the system (the vendor\u0026rsquo;s system/end user system) Coarse-grained access control that gives service owners the ability to control access to their API Authorization bearer in the form of a System User token (Maskinporten token with extended information about the System User) End User System The definition for the end user system. This definition contains, among other things, which rights the system needs from the System User, and which Maskinporten client (client ID) the system intends to use for authentication in Maskinporten. The system is registered and owned by the end user system vendor in the System Registry.\nIn Use The end user system requests a System User token from Maskinporten. The request specifies the necessary scopes, client ID, and the organization number of the end user organization it acts on behalf of. Maskinporten verifies against Altinn Authorization that the customer has granted access to the end user system linked to the client. Given that a valid System User exists, a Maskinporten token with System User information is returned. The end user system (SBS) queries the service with the Maskinporten token. The service authenticates the SBS and verifies that the token contains the necessary scopes to use the service. Then a query is made against Altinn Authorization to verify that the System User has the necessary authorizations. Delivery Plan System User will be delivered as part of several releases.\nMore detailed information about the delivery plan and status can be found in Digdir\u0026rsquo;s Roadmap\n"

	"content": "Terms Below are key terms used in the user scenarios.\nSystem vendor Provider of end-user software available on the market. Has access to the system register in Altinn to register software with the necessary rights.\nFor locally installed or self-developed software, the system customer is also registered as the vendor.\nEnd-user system Software that usually runs in the public cloud, but can also be run locally with some limitations. The end-user system supports organization and citizen processes and can for example be used for lice reporting or VAT reporting.\nThe end-user system can identify itself as a system user associated with the system. Which rights are required depends on the processes supported.\nSystem user Virtual user for which system vendors can obtain tokens. Grants the end-user system the rights that the system user has.\nThe system user is only assigned rights from the system customer.\nSystem customer The organization that has procured the end-user system. The system user is created for the system customer, and the system vendor is given authority to authenticate as the system user on behalf of the system customer.\nSystem user for client relationships Virtual user for which the system vendor can obtain tokens, used in client relationships where the system user is delegated rights for one or more clients.\nSystem user token Token issued by Maskinporten that identifies a system user. Also contains information about the end-user system and the system vendor.\nClient Organization that has an agreement with a service provider for support of organization processes. “Client” is often used in accounting and auditor contexts and corresponds to \u0026ldquo;customer\u0026rdquo;.\nIn reporting contexts the client is often referred to as the \u0026ldquo;party\u0026rdquo;.\nClient administrator Employee at the system customer responsible for linking their clients (customers) to the correct system users.\nAccess package A collection of rights for public services, defined in Altinn. Service owners bind rights to a given package, which has a name/scope adapted to the services.\nGeneral assumptions The following apply to most user scenarios:\nSystem vendor responsibility for access control Have an overview of which rights system users need (e.g., access packages or individual rights for VAT reporting).\nInformation about rights is obtained from the service owner or via the Altinn API. The service owner must communicate requirements clearly. Configure these rights in the system register so that system users can be granted the necessary rights per customer. Access control in the end-user system When using a system user, public services will not know the identity of the person behind the software that triggers issuance of a system user token and API calls.\nTo avoid misuse, system vendors must have good routines for authentication and authorization of users in the end-user system so that only authorized users get access to system user tokens.\nThis is especially important for larger organizations, such as accounting firms with many customers and employees, where there is a need to restrict access to data for different customers.\n1. Registered accountant reports data for a client Example: VAT reporting\nPreconditions The accountant is registered in the Enhetsregisteret for the relevant client. The Tax Administration has defined a policy on the application so that users with the access package \u0026ldquo;VAT reporting\u0026rdquo; get access. The end-user system is configured with the necessary access packages for VAT reporting. The accountant has created a system user for client relationships linked to the end-user system. Steps Add client\nThe client administrator at the accounting firm links the accounting client (client) to the system user. Access for the accounting client is automatically delegated to the system user. Retrieve token\nThe end-user system retrieves a system user token via Maskinporten. Send report\nThe end-user system sends the VAT report via the API with a valid token. Validation and confirmation\nThe API calls Altinn Authorization PDP to check access. The API returns confirmation. Support: Developed as part of system user delivery 5.\n2. Property manager reports data for the principal Rett Revisjon is property manager for several housing cooperatives. They have a dedicated team working with housing cooperatives and want a system user setup limited to this team and able to handle both registered and unregistered property managers.\nService: Reporting for housing cooperatives\nThis service has configured that the following access packages grant the right to report for housing cooperatives\nregnskapsforer-med-signeringsrettighet ansvarlig-revisor skattegrunnlag forretningsforer-eiendom Preconditions The property manager is registered in the Enhetsregisteret for the housing cooperative. The system vendor has registered the system in the system register with the mentioned access package. The system vendor has user management such that the property manager team can be assigned rights for functionality that uses the system user. Steps System vendor sends a request to create a system user for clients to the property manager (the customer). The access package forretningsforer-eiendom is included as a requirement. The property manager approves the request. The property manager defines the property manager team in the end-user system and assigns which authenticated users (i.e., employees) can use the property manager functionality. The client administrator adds the housing cooperative as a customer/client on the system user. The access package is automatically delegated to the system user. The employee logs in and the end-user system validates that the employee can use the property manager functionality. Reporting takes place via the system. A system user token is retrieved from Maskinporten. Submission is done via API. Access is verified by Altinn PDP API. Customers with multiple types of client relationships Support: Developed as part of system user delivery 5.\n3. Accountant needing to differentiate access to system user Rett Revisjon\u0026rsquo;s small business division allocates tasks internally and has now delegated reporting of payments to self-employed individuals to staff who are unregistered accountants for those companies.\nSome are delegated access packages from their clients.\nSome have access packages re-delegated from a registered auditor at Rett Revisjon.\nRett Revisjon is concerned that actions may be performed on behalf of companies via the system user that exceed the responsibility of the unregistered accountants (often by accident).\nChallenge When using a system user, the service does not know the identity of the person initiating the calls. It may be fully automated processes or actions performed by a logged-in user in the end-user system. Delegations in Altinn authorization do not affect who is actually using the system, and an end-user system therefore has no reliable way to verify which rights each user has been granted in Altinn.\nConsequence: the end-user system must handle local authentication and authorization so that only authorized employees get access to functionality that calls Altinn on behalf of clients.\nService: Payments to self-employed persons\nThe following access packages are relevant for reporting:\nregnskapsforer-med-signeringsrettighet ansvarlig-revisor skattegrunnlag Preconditions Rett Revisjon is registered in the Enhetsregisteret for relevant clients. Unregistered clients have organization-delegated the access package skattegrunnlag to Rett Revisjon. The system vendor has registered the system in the system register with the required access packages. The system supports customer management so clients can be assigned to employees/roles. Rett Revisjon has defined which clients are registered vs. unregistered. Steps System vendor sends a request to create a system user for registered clients (requirement: regnskapsforer-med-signeringsrettighet). System vendor sends a request to create a system user for unregistered clients (requirement: skattegrunnlag). Rett Revisjon approves the requests. Rett Revisjon defines which employees should have access to registered and unregistered clients in the end-user system. The client administrator distributes the clients across the correct system users (the accesses are re-delegated to the system user). The employee logs in to the end-user system; the system validates locally that the person has the rights for the chosen client. Reporting is sent via the system. A system user token is retrieved from Maskinporten. Submission is done via API. Access is verified by Altinn PDP API. The system must implement access control itself 4. Unregistered accountant reports data for a client Scenario: The client is not registered in Enhetsregisteret with an accountant.\nPreconditions The client (accounting customer) has an agreement with the accountant for accounting services. The accountant has purchased the end-user system and configured it. Steps Request access\nThe accountant asks the client to delegate the necessary rights. Delegation\nThe client delegates via Altinn. Add client\nThe client administrator at the accounting firm links the client to the system user. Access is re-delegated to the system user. Retrieve token\nThe system user token is retrieved from Maskinporten. Reporting\nSubmission is done via API. Validation\nAltinn verifies access and returns confirmation. Support: Developed as part of system user delivery 6.\n5. Organization reports its own data Scenario: The organization uses a system user for reporting.\nPreconditions The system is configured with the resource that defines the service. Steps Procurement of the system\nThe organization purchases a system from a vendor. Request a system user\nThe vendor sends a request to create a system user with the necessary accesses. Approval\nThe organization approves, and the system user is created. Reporting\nThe system retrieves a token and sends data via API. Validation\nThe API checks access and returns confirmation. Support: Setup with single rights was developed as part of system user delivery 2.\nSetup with access packages is developed as part of system user delivery 4.\nReporting of own data 6. Accountant retrieves messages for a client via Dialogporten Scenario: System user retrieves messages sent to a client.\nPreconditions Access to messages is included in the access package. The system supports Dialogporten. Steps Request a system user\nThe vendor sends a request with requirements for message scope. Approval\nThe accountant/organization approves the request. Client linking\nThe client administrator has linked the client to the system user. Retrieve token\nToken is retrieved from Maskinporten. Retrieve messages\nMessages are fetched via API. Validation\nAltinn validates and returns messages. 7. Organization sends a file via a brokerage service (broker) Scenario: Submission of registration of title (tinglysning) via the Land Registry\u0026rsquo;s brokerage service.\nPreconditions The Land Registry has defined a resource and access. The system vendor has registered the system and received approval. Steps User sends the registration via the system. Token is retrieved from Maskinporten. The API is called with the token. Access is validated by Altinn. 8. Organization has developed its own reporting system Scenario: Self-developed solution for submission via a brokerage service.\nPreconditions Agreement with DigDir and access to the system register. The system is registered with the necessary rights. Steps A request for a system user is sent (to itself). The request is approved. Token is retrieved. The system sends data via API. Homemade system 9. Organization has purchased SAP for local installation Scenario: SAP software is installed on the organization\u0026rsquo;s own servers, without SAP having control.\nPreconditions The organization has an agreement with DigDir for access to the system register. The organization has created a Maskinporten client. The organization registers the system in the register representing the SAP installation, with the necessary access rights. The key for the client is installed and available on the server. Steps A request to create a system user is sent to the organization itself. The request is approved and the system user is created with the correct rights. The system can now create Maskinporten tokens for the system user and call the necessary APIs. Note: In such scenarios, the system vendor cannot share its own certificate/key pair with the system customer, as this could lead to misuse and access to customer data across system customers.\n10. Rett Revisjon is accountant and auditor reporting the shareholder register for clients Scenario: The firm Rett Revisjon offers accounting and auditing services in the market. For audit clients, Rett Revisjon is registered in the ER with the role REVI for their customers.\nFor accounting clients, some have registered Rett Revisjon as their accountant with the role REGN, while others have organization-delegated access packages such as Skattegrunnlag.\nThe service \u0026ldquo;Reporting shareholder register\u0026rdquo; has a setup that grants the following access packages the right to report\nregnskapsforer-med-signeringsrettighet (ER registered accountant) ansvarlig-revisor (ER registered auditor) skattegrunnlag (organization-delegated access package from the client\u0026rsquo;s CEO) revisormedarbeider (ER registered auditor) Rett Revisjon has purchased Maestro to report the shareholder register.\nPreconditions Rett Revisjon has shared with Maestro which client relationship they have for each customer. Steps Maestro sends a request to create a system user for client relationships that require revisormedarbeider. Maestro sends a request to create a system user for client relationships that require skattegrunnlag. Maestro sends a request to create a system user for client relationships that require regnskapsforer-med-signeringsrettighet. Rett Revisjon accepts these requests. Rett Revisjon allocates their clients to the correct system users (see which package is linked to the system user). Rett Revisjon uses Maestro to report for Customer A. Maestro must at submission time know which type of client relationship Customer A has with Rett Revisjon to select the correct system user. This must be shared by Rett Revisjon. Maestro must request a system user token from Maskinporten for the correct system user. Maestro submits the shareholder register with the correct system user token. The Tax Administration authorizes that the system user has the right to report the shareholder register for Customer A. Customers with multiple types of client relationships Note: An alternative solution would be to register a system per customer type and link each system user to that. This avoids extref but then you must manage a corresponding large number of clients.\n10b. New customers Rett Revisjon has acquired new customers. These must be linked to the correct system user based on the type of client relationship.\nPreconditions Rett Revisjon knows it has acquired new customers. Steps Go to system user admin. Identify the correct system user based on which customer to link to the system user. Add the customer. Screenshots Below are some screenshots for this scenario.\nSystem user request System user request Overview of system users System user details Link client to system user NAV Scenario A (functionality not currently prioritized) Example: Accountant uses \u0026ldquo;Superavstemming\u0026rdquo; from Kontrollen AS.\nChallenges NAV does not offer access packages with granularity only for A06/A07. Granular rights for system users or clients are not supported. Steps System vendor sends a request for a limited system user. The accountant approves. Clients are added and assigned only A06/A07. Reporting occurs via the system. Token is retrieved and the API is called. Authorization via Altinn PDP. NAV Scenario B (functionality not currently prioritized) The service provider has purchased the system Superavstemming from Kontrollen AS.\nSuperavstemming needs the necessary accesses to retrieve reconciliation data for the a-reporting (A06/A07) for the clients the system will be used for.\nThe service provider wants to ensure that Superavstemming does not receive rights beyond retrieving reconciliation data for a-reporting.\nThe client has only purchased the service \u0026ldquo;reconciliation of a-reporting\u0026rdquo; and wants to delegate rights only for this.\n(Here there are a few specific rights needed, likely not a whole access package, as access packages are often coarse-grained.)\nNAV Scenario C (functionality not currently prioritized) The service provider has purchased the system Superavstemming from Kontrollen AS.\nSuperavstemming needs the necessary accesses to retrieve reconciliation data for a-reporting (A06/A07) for the relevant clients.\nThe service provider wants to ensure that Superavstemming does not receive rights beyond what is necessary.\nThe client has purchased several services but wants to delegate only the necessary rights for the relevant services.\n(Here there will be several different rights relevant, but there is no single suitable access package.)\n"

	"description": "Altinn Studio a platform that lets you develop, operate, and manage public digital services for citizens and businesses.",
	"content": "The platform runs on a secure, isolated, and scalable infrastructure and is pre-integrated with a range of shared solutions and open APIs. Altinn Studio supports both user interfaces for manual submission and APIs for machine-to-machine submission.\nWhat can I create with Altinn Studio? With Altinn Studio, you can develop digital services that cover a broad spectrum of use cases - from simple form services and information solutions to complex workflows with payment and signing functionality. The platform supports everything from traditional forms to custom applications with advanced integrations.\nSee detailed overview of use cases for a description of the possibilities.\nAltinn Studio is the \u0026ldquo;connector\u0026rdquo; A form is rarely just data fields to be submitted; more is needed to create a good service – e.g., connection to ID-porten, submission to the case processing system or connection to national registers.\nAltinn Studio has pre-developed integrations with several of Digdir\u0026rsquo;s shared services and national registers, and will continue to develop and add more.\nAltinn Studio is the connector Low-code and traditional code Altinn Studio is a hybrid between low-code and traditional coding. This means you can start with low-code in Altinn Studio Designer and switch to dedicated development tools like Visual Studio Code if you have advanced needs that require coding.\nOur goal is to do as much as possible with low-code but retain the option for traditional coding and the flexibility it provides. This allows non-technical resources to design and publish services without the need to involve developers. At the same time, a developer can be brought in to create more advanced functionality that requires coding.\nThe tool supports both low-code and traditional coding Principles that Altinn Studio is built on Here are some of the principles underlying our development of Altinn Studio.\nFree and open-source code because we genuinely believe that openness and the opportunity for others to contribute is the way to go for developing services in the public sector. Based on open standards because closed code ties you to a supplier and often entails additional costs. Cloud-based infrastructure where loose connections are sought without binding to a specific cloud provider. Built on modern and popular frameworks/products because it makes it easier for both us and our customers to acquire technical resources and because it\u0026rsquo;s something one wants to work with/learn. Embedded security where each layer in the architecture authorizes use regardless of where the calls come from. Isolation – Service owners get their own environments for testing and production. Open source and collaboration Altinn Studio is not perfect, but it takes you a long way in creating good digital services - and we continuously add new functionality.\nInstead of creating something on your own or buying something – why not contribute to the open-source project where there may be gaps and thus give something back to the community? The Altinn Studio teams handle quality assurance and ongoing code management.\nCreating an environment around the development of services is important to us, and we now have a good number of contributors from many public agencies contributing to advancing the product with us. Contributions range from fixing typos that take seconds to fix to major components that have taken months.\nAn important part of creating an environment is the developer contact we have via Altinn Slack. Each service owner has their own channel where questions can be asked. We also see that service owners help each other and share experiences across organizations. Backlog, user stories, plans, and roadmaps – everything is openly available on GitHub, providing both insight and comments.\nGovernance The Studio product consists of multiple components. Here are core services and libraries that are owned and governed by the Studio team:\nStudio Designer New features and bugfixes are continuously deployed on a daily basis Development and work is tracked in the Altinn/altinn-studio GitHub repository App libraries - Altinn.App.Api, Altinn.App.Core and the frontend Libraries hosted on NuGet.org. All Studio apps reference these libraries Versioned using SemVer 2.0. Prereleases consist of preview and rc (release candidate) stages. When rc stage is reached we intend to only do bug fixes and patching until stabilization HTTP APIs described in the app via OpenAPI specifications have their own versioning scheme. API changes here occur in line with major version changes in the rest of the app (the libraries). Note that there may be APIs that are not described in OpenAPI specifications; these are intended for internal use and we may make changes to these without any communication. Development and work is tracked in the Altinn/app-lib-dotnet and Altinn/app-frontend-react GitHub repositories Localtest - local copy of core Altinn platform APIs New features and bugfixes are continuously deployed as needed Development and work is tracked in the Altinn/app-localtest GitHub repository The apps themselves are owned and operated by the owning organisation.\n"

	"description": "A brief introduction to Dialogporten.",
	"content": "What is Dialogporten? Dialogporten is a solution which serves as a common API and metadata state store for digital dialogs. The primary goal of Dialogporten is to facilitate secure and efficient communication between public service platforms (such as Altinn) and users by providing a standardized way to handle digital dialogs and messages. This involves managing the metadata associated with these dialogs and ensuring interoperability across different systems.\nWhat is stored in Dialogporten? Dialogporten contains \u0026ldquo;dialogs\u0026rdquo;, which are representations of a particular instance of a digital service. A dialog consists of a sender (usually a government actor), a recipient (a citizen or organization) and a reference to a digital service definition in Altinn Resource Registry, which itself contains information about the service itself as well as authorization policies governing its use.\nIn addition, a dialog contains some content used to describe to end users the state of the dialog and give information on what the user should do (if anything), such as a title field, a short summary text, and activity history showing the various actions performed and state changes throughout the life-time of the dialog.\nWhat is not stored in Dialogporten? Actual content, such as body texts, forms, form data entered by users, attachments etc. are not included in the dialog, but merely referenced using URLs pointing to the resources at the digital service platform in which the service is realized.\nHow does this work? Dialogporten operates on a read-only basis 1 for end users. The digital service platforms (e.g., Altinn), which we refer to as \u0026ldquo;service providers\u0026rdquo;, on behalf of a service owner (the government actor), performs the writes to the dialog. This means that while users can view the state and metadata of their dialogs through Dialogporten, any updates or actions are managed and recorded by the service platform itself - usually in sync with the user interacting with the relevant service, e.g., filling out or submitting a form. This ensures that data remains consistent and secure across all systems involved. 1There are two exceptions; dialog labels, which users can assign in order to keep the dialogs organized, and the seen log which keeps track of user access to dialogs. How do app developers in Altinn use Dialogporten? The Altinn platform will automatically make all app instances and correspondence available in Dialogporten, exposing relevant information and actions, and will update the representation as the app instance/correspondence gets updated.\nFor additional control, the app template utilizes a Dialogporten API client that enables the app to take full control on how the app is represented in Dialogporten, and thus portals like Altinn Inbox (\u0026ldquo;arbeidsflate\u0026rdquo;).\nThe app template integration is under development. For now, app developers must utilize the Dialogporten API client NuGet package directly. Where do the user find the dialogs? Users can access their dialogs by logging in to altinn.no and navigating to their \u0026ldquo;arbeidsflate\u0026rdquo;, which is the common Dialogporten frontend (previosuly called \u0026ldquo;inbox\u0026rdquo;). This utilizes Dialogporten end-user APIs to search for and view dialogs and visualizes the dialogs, providing users with an intuitive interface to manage their interactions. Additionally, other end-user systems can utilize the same APIs to create tailored user experiences, allowing for flexible integration with various service provider platforms.\nThe next generation of the Altinn \u0026ldquo;inbox\u0026rdquo; GUI is under development and not currently available. Track the progress of the \u0026ldquo;Arbeidsflate\u0026rdquo; development in the roadmap Next steps Read more about what Dialogporten has to offer in high level functionality and features\nAn overview of the features provided by Dialogporten "

Ensure that your app uses version 8.1.0 or higher of the NuGet packages to enable native notifications. For optimal performance and security, always use the latest stable version.\nFor detailed guidance on Altinn App development, refer to the Altinn Studio documentation.\n2. Review policies for relevant resources in the Altinn Resource Registry Note: All intended recipients must be granted read through the policy of the resource. Associating a notification with a resource results in the policy of said resource being used to identify the correct recipients of the notification. All intended recipients must be granted read through the policy of the resource.\nA resource in this case can be both an Altinn App or a resource (tjenesteeierressurs).\nFor Altinn Apps, you must also ensure that the access-subject has read granted for all relevant tasks and events.\nA new Altinn Resources can be registered in Altinn Studio or through an API. Please reference Altinn Resource Administration for instructions on how to create a new resource.\nThe policy for both Altinn Apps and other Altinn Resources can be managed in Altinn Studio. Please reference the Altinn Studio documentation on how to do this.\n3. Understand guidelines and best practices for sending notifications To ensure effective communication, it is essential to strictly define what qualifies as a notification and avoid overwhelming users with too many messages.\nFamiliarize yourself with our guidelines to understand what notifications should and should not contain, promoting digital safety and preventing notification fatigue.\n4. Set up your app to send notifications Follow the instructions in the Altinn App reference documentation to configure your app for sending notifications.\n"

These are:\nThe Norwegian Tax Administration The Norwegian Public Roads Administration The Norwegian Food Safety Authority The Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund Norwegian Helsenett NAV (Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration) The Norwegian Digitalisation Agency Important information to service owners of «Delegatable API resources» in Altinn As we have previously informed you, we are now in the process of decomposing and migrating Altinn Authorization from the Altinn 2 platform to Altinn 3 format. See here for information about the progress plan.\nWe are starting by moving functionality and services of the type «Delegatable API resources» and according to the plan this will happen at the end of January/beginning of February. See here for detailed information about moving services.\nAll services of the type \u0026ldquo;Delegatable API resources\u0026rdquo; will be moved from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3 in one operation. There are currently about 82 services of this type. This will result in a short downtime for these services. Downtime will be announced in advance.\nDigdir will take responsibility for actually moving the services from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3. All delegations that have been made on the services will be preserved and moved together with the service. This means that all system suppliers who today have the right to use your APIs on behalf of their customers will retain these delegations even after the services have been moved.\nWhat service owners must do before services are migrated Attached you will find a list of all Delegatable API resources that your agency is the service owner for and that currently exist in production in Altinn. We ask that you go through the list of these and check the following:\nIs the service still in use and should it be moved from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3? Is the title of the service of good and user-friendly quality so that it is easy for users to find the service? a. Title must be provided in all three languages (en, nb, nn) and is separated by commas in the file. Is the delegation description of good and user-friendly quality that explains to users what services and information they are giving the system supplier access to? a. Delegation description must be provided in all three languages (en, nb, nn) and is separated by commas in the file. We ask that you give us written feedback on this by January 15. Services we do not receive feedback on will not be migrated and will thus be taken out of production and will no longer function.\nConsequences for you as service owner after migration Today, new services of the type «Delegatable API resources» are created via a REST interface «/maskinporten-api/delegationSchemes» in Altinn 2. After the services have been moved, this API will no longer be available.\nWe will create new APIs to register services of the type \u0026ldquo;Delegatable API resources\u0026rdquo;, but in a transition phase, those who want to create new services must do this by sending an email to Digdir so that we can do it for you.\nIf you have questions, you can reach us via digdir-samarbeid.slack.com or by sending an email to tjenesteeier@altinn.no.\n"

It\u0026rsquo;s a regular event with a specific type platform.events.validatesubscription. There is already a handler for this type registered and the validation should be done without further action required.\nRun custom code when receiving events All inbound events are received through the EventsReceiverController on the route /{org}/{app}/api/v1/eventsreceiver. The controller uses IEventHandlerResolver interface to resolve the the class that should handle the event based on mapping the incoming event type to the EventType property on registered implementations of IEventHandler.\nIn order to handle an inbound event, all you have to do is two things:\nCreate an implementation of IEventHandler Register your implementation in Program.cs Create an implementation of IEventHandler In order to run your code when you receive an event, you need to create a class implementing the IEventHandler interface. IEventHandler is an interface that can have multiple implementations registered. The key to resolving the correct implementation is the event type which means you need to set the EventType property equal to the event type you want to handle. This is then matched against the event type of the incoming events, and the ProcessEvent method is invoked.\nYour implementation can of course have a constructor that takes in any registered service from the dependency injection container needed to handle the event.\nusing Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Models; namespace Altinn.App.Core.Internal.Events { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Implementation used to handled events that the Event system used to validate /// the events receiver endpoint. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public class SubscriptionValidationHandler : IEventHandler { /// \u0026lt;inheritdoc/\u0026gt; public string EventType =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;platform.events.validatesubscription\u0026#34;; /// \u0026lt;inheritdoc/\u0026gt; public Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessEvent(CloudEvent cloudEvent) { return Task.FromResult(true); } } } Register your implementation in Program.cs Add your implementation of the IEventHandler interface in Program.cs to allow the resolver to find it.\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;IEventHandler, SubscriptionValidationHandler\u0026gt;(); "

	"description": "Instructions for setting up application A",
	"content": "Application A is responsible for triggering the instantiation of application B and passing data to it. To accomplish this, several steps must be followed.\nExtend the application process with an additional process task. Add logic for instantiation of application B to an event trigger. Populate/retrieve and pass on relevant data to the newly created instance of application B. These guidelines assume that a basic Altinn application already exists. The focus is on the more technical adaptations necessary for realizing the purpose of the multi-app solution Add task to process Why the need for multiple tasks In most cases it is necessary to pass the data the end user has added to the form, further on to application B. This data is preserved in the pdf-element which is stored as a part of the instance object. However, this pdf is only generated at the end of a process task. Hence there is need for an extra task to be able to retrieve the pdf. You will need to have at least two tasks, where the final task is not a data task. The task can be a confirm or feedback task type. We recommend using the confirm task type, and this is what the following guidelines will use.\nHow to extend the process with multiple tasks In order to add task types to extend the application process, we need to update process.bpmn and policy.xml.\nYou will find examples of how to adapt the process.bpmn file, where the application process is defined, in the process documentation. When using the confirm task type we need to allow for going back to a previous task type, which also means that we need to take advantage of exclusive gateways. Read more about exclusive gateways here. The policy.xml file, where the authorization rules are defined, needs updates so read and write operations can be done on the new task. See XACML policy , policy editor and Guidelines for authorization rules for details. Most apps allow this by default by the current template. Trigger the instantiation of application B Why triggering instantiation of application B needs custom adaptations The essential purpose of a multi-app solution relies on the fact that an instance of an application is created by a given trigger action in another Altinn application. The native way of instantiating an Altinn application is by doing an API POST request to the running Altinn application. However, there is no built-in way in the Altinn context to trigger this behaviour which means that we will need to trigger the API request as custom code in application A.\nHow to customize application A to trigger instantiation of application B The general approach for an Altinn application to perform custom operations is by implement code on certain hooks, which are predefined functions in app-backend. Read about how this custom code is added here.\nIf not already present, create a file for implementing the custom code that runs on the end events, ProcessTaskEnd.cs. In the file, implement the code that creates the instance object that will be used as the foundation for the new instance of application B. See the below example for a template. Make sure that the instance creation happens when the task is finished, i.e. use the ProcessTaskEnd.End() function. This is necessary since the user can go back to the data task and do changes on the form. The instanceOwner-part of the instance object is essential as this is where you specify the instance owner. Defining it by OrganisationNumber means that the owner is an organization, while defining it by PersonNumber means that the owner is a private person. A natural part of the instance object is the prefill section where you will add the desired data that the new instance of application B should be prefilled with. The resulting instance object, will look something like this:\nvar instanceTemplate = new InstansiationInstance { InstanceOwner = new InstanceOwner { //OrganisationNumber = [receiverOrgNr], Or //PersonNumber = [receiverSsnNr], }, Prefill = new() { {\u0026#34;someDataInReceiverDataModel\u0026#34;, someValueFromThisTriggerAppliaction}, {\u0026#34;moreDataInReceiverDataModel\u0026#34;, someStaticValue}, ... }, }; To actually perform the request to create the instance, we need to add a client. Refer to the consume documentation to see an example of how such a client can be added to the application. A fitting name for the client used in this context might be f.ex. AppInstantiationClient. In addition to the instructions in the referenced documentation, our constructor needs additional configuration to the HttpClient. Add the following code the the constructor to add a subscription key to the header of the requests sent by the http client.\npublic AppClient( ... HttpClient httpClient, ... { ... httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(General.SubscriptionKeyHeaderName, platformSettings.Value.SubscriptionKey); _client = httpClient; ... } Instead of creating a function in the client named GetCountry, as in the referenced documentation above, implement the following function,CreateNewInstance:\npublic async Task\u0026lt;Instance\u0026gt; CreateNewInstance(string AppOwnerOrgName, string applicationB, InstansiationInstance instanceTemplate) { string apiUrl = $\u0026#34;{AppOwnerOrgName}/{applicationB}/instances/create\u0026#34;; string envUrl = $\u0026#34;https://{AppOwnerOrgName}.apps.{_settings.HostName}\u0026#34;; _client.BaseAddress = new Uri(envUrl); StringContent content = new StringContent(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(instanceTemplate), Encoding.UTF8, \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;); HttpResponseMessage response = await _client.PostAsync(apiUrl, content); if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode) { Instance createdInstance = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject\u0026lt;Instance\u0026gt;(await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync()); return createdInstance; } throw await PlatformHttpException.CreateAsync(response); } In the ProcessTaskEnd.cs file, add the new AppInstantiationClient to the ProcessTaskEnd class in the same way as the CountryClient is added to the DataProcessingHandler class in the consume documentation. Further, call the method triggering the request in the appInstantiationClient like this:\nInstance applicationBInstance = await _appInstantiationClient.CreateNewInstance([AppOwnerOrgName], [applicationB], [instanceTemplate]); If the client should authenticate itself as the end user, rather than the application owner via maskinporten, please reference the app-lib client implementations on details for how to adapt the API request in the AppInstantiationClient to achieve this.\nDelivering Data to Application B Why manipulating the data for application B in application A It is natural to utilize the multi-app solution to control the presentation of information in application B dynamically depending on what data is inserted in an instance of application A. This means that all adaptations on application B that is dependent on data retrieved from application A, must be done in application A and in some way delivered or represented in application B.\nRetrieving data from application A to pass over to application B Before some data types can be added, they must be retrieved from Altinn Storage since the application does not have direct access to this by default. The probably most attractive data type to pass over from application A to application B is the pdf including all the information filled into the instance of application A. To retrieve this data from application A, it needs to be collected from Altinn Storage. The pdf exists on the instance object as a part of the dataTypes field with the name ref-data-as-pdf. This can be fetched by getting the instance and fetch the data directly on the retrieved instance object, or by using the already defined GetBinaryData method on the dataClient. See example code below of both below:\n// Using the instance object directly with the GetInstance method on the InstanceClient Instance updatedInstance = await _instanceClient.GetInstance(innsendingsApp, mutliAppOwner, int.Parse(instance.InstanceOwner.PartyId), instanceGuid); DataElement pdf = updatedInstance.Data.FindLast(d =\u0026gt; d.DataType == \u0026#34;ref-data-as-pdf\u0026#34;); // Using the GetBinaryData method on the DataClient var stream = await _dataClient.GetBinaryData(instance.Org, instance.AppId,int.Parse(instance.InstanceOwner.PartyId), instanceGuid, Guid.Parse(pdf.Id)); NB: In order to use these methods in the ProcessTaskEnd class, the constructor needs to be configured to use the InstanceClient and/or the DataClient.\nHow to control data in application B from application A There are several ways to control certain data in application B, whereas one or multiple can be utilized:\nAlt 1: Add data as values on the datamodel of application B by adding the data model field name and the corresponding value in the prefill field of the instance template that you created in the Trigger the instantiation of application B section above.\nAlt 2: If the intention is to manipulate the texts in Altinn Inbox for the instances of application B, use presentation fields .\nAlt 3: Add data as binary data by doing a POST request to the instance of application B.\npublic async Task\u0026lt;DataElement\u0026gt; InsertBinaryData(string org, string app, string instanceId, string contentType, string filename, Stream stream) { string envUrl = $\u0026#34;https://{org}.apps.{_settings.HostName}\u0026#34;; _client.BaseAddress = new Uri(envUrl); string apiUrl = $\u0026#34;{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceId}/data?dataType=vedlegg\u0026#34;; StreamContent content = new(stream); content.Headers.ContentType = MediaTypeHeaderValue.Parse(contentType); if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(filename)) { content.Headers.ContentDisposition = new ContentDispositionHeaderValue(DispositionTypeNames.Attachment) { FileName = filename, FileNameStar = filename }; } HttpResponseMessage response = await _client.PostAsync(apiUrl, content); if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode) { await Task.CompletedTask; } } "

These APIs will usually require tokens with specific scopes, such as \u0026ldquo;altinn:correspondence.read\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;altinn:instances.read\u0026rdquo;. The scopes can be provisioned to the same client and placed in the same token as the one used against Dialogporten. ID-porten authentication ID-porten authentication should be employed by end-user systems that want to access Dialogporten and related services using the identity of a single person, and utilize their authorization in order to access dialogs available across the parties in which the authenticated user has access. This is the API that is being used by the common GUI frontend (\u0026ldquo;arbeidsflate\u0026rdquo;) available after logging in to altinn.no.\nThe following general steps must be performed in order to access the end-user API as a person:\nCreate a ID-porten integration (OAuth2 client) Provision the scope digdir:dialogporten on the client, as well as any additional scopes required for access content data (ie. altinn:correspondence.read) Redirect the user to the authorize-endpoint in ID-porten, where they authenticate themselves and consent to you integration getting access to call Dialogporten on your behalf At your redirect endpoint, use the authorization code provided against the ID-porten token endpoint to get an access token Perform requests to the end-user API using the access token in a Authorization: Bearer \u0026lt;token\u0026gt; header. ID-porten implements a standard OAuth2 protocol, and issues refresh tokens that can be stored and reused in order to get fresh access tokens at a later stage. Authorizations (OAuth \u0026ldquo;consents\u0026rdquo;) to the digdir:dialogporten scope are valid up to 90 days.\nFor detailed steps on how to create an ID-porten integration and utilizing the OAuth2 protocol, see the ID-porten documentation linked below.\nRead more\nAbout ID-porten (norwegian) Getting started with ID-porten Using Altinn Token Exchange Maskinporten authentication with system users System users are the new and preferred authentication method where an organization can create a \u0026ldquo;virtual user\u0026rdquo;, delegate it service rights and associate it with a system - either self-owned or provided by a third-party. This is the successor of the \u0026ldquo;enterprise user (virksomhetsbruker)\u0026rdquo; in Altinn 2, and allows for a more secure and user friendly onboarding process for customers and end-users.\nFor detailed steps on how to create and utilize a system user, see the link below.\nRead more\nAuthenticating with system users Usage for service owner systems Service owner systems must use Maskinporten-issued tokens, optionally exchanged in Altinn Token Exchange.\nThere are several scopes defining access to various parts of the service owner API:\nScope Grants access to digdir:dialogporten.serviceprovider All service owner APIs, except the search/list API digdir:dialogporten.serviceprovider.search All service owner APIs, including the search/list API digdir:dialogporten.serviceprovider.correspondence Create and update dialogs referring a service resource of type CorrespondenceService in Altinn Resource Registry (internal use only) Using these scopes requires the organization in the consumer claim of the to be registered as a service owner (\u0026ldquo;org\u0026rdquo;) in Altinn.

Valid examples:\nurn:altinn:subresource:mysubresource urn:altinn:task:Task_1 urn:altinn:resource:someotherresource In addition, a bare non-URN string like foobar can be supplied as a shorthand for urn:altinn:subresource:foobar The authorization attribute is split at the last segment, and the first part is used as the attribute id and the second part as the attribute value.\nMapping to XACML Eg. given a dialog that has ServiceResource set to urn:altinn:resource:myfirstservice and a GUI/API action shaped like this on a dialog :\n{ \u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sign\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;authorizationAttribute\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:task:gm_signing_task\u0026#34;, ... } will result in a XACML request like this:\n{ \u0026#34;Request\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;AccessSubject\u0026#34;: [ /* information about the user omitted */ ], \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Attribute\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;AttributeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sign\u0026#34; } ] } ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Attribute\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;AttributeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myfirstservice\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;AttributeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:task\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;gm_signing_task\u0026#34; } /* information about the party owning the dialog omitted */ ] } ] } } This can be governed by a policy rule like this:\n\u0026lt;xacml:Rule RuleId=\u0026#34;urn:altinn:example:ruleid:1\u0026#34; Effect=\u0026#34;Permit\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:Description\u0026gt;A rule giving user with role DAGL to \u0026#34;sign\u0026#34; within the task named \u0026#34;gm_signing_task\u0026#34;\u0026lt;/xacml:Description\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:Target\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AnyOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AllOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:Match MatchId=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:function:string-equal-ignore-case\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AttributeValue DataType=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\u0026#34;\u0026gt;DAGL\u0026lt;/xacml:AttributeValue\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AttributeDesignator AttributeId=\u0026#34;urn:altinn:rolecode\u0026#34; Category=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:subject-category:access-subject\u0026#34; DataType=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\u0026#34; MustBePresent=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:Match\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:AllOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:AnyOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AnyOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AllOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:Match MatchId=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AttributeValue DataType=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\u0026#34;\u0026gt;myfirstservice\u0026lt;/xacml:AttributeValue\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AttributeDesignator AttributeId=\u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource\u0026#34; Category=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:resource\u0026#34; DataType=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\u0026#34; MustBePresent=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:Match\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:Match MatchId=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AttributeValue DataType=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\u0026#34;\u0026gt;gm_signing_task\u0026lt;/xacml:AttributeValue\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AttributeDesignator AttributeId=\u0026#34;urn:altinn:task\u0026#34; Category=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:resource\u0026#34; DataType=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\u0026#34; MustBePresent=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:Match\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:AllOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:AnyOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AnyOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AllOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:Match MatchId=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AttributeValue DataType=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\u0026#34;\u0026gt;sign\u0026lt;/xacml:AttributeValue\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AttributeDesignator AttributeId=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id\u0026#34; Category=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action\u0026#34; DataType=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\u0026#34; MustBePresent=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:Match\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:AllOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:AnyOf\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:Target\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:Rule\u0026gt; If the request fails, Dialogporten will flag the GUI/API-action or transmission with isAuthorized: false and remove the associated URLs. This allows for end user systems to indicate to the user that access to the given action is denied.\nWhile Dialogporten indicates that the action is unauthorized, and removes the URLs, the endpoint should still always perform authentication/authorization on incoming requests and not rely on Dialogporten simply obscuring access to the endpoints Using authorization attributes on transmissions For transmissions, the mechanics are the same, but there are no explicit actions associated with transmission. Therefore, either read or transmissionread actions are inferred and used in the XACML requests.\nIf a authorization attribute is supplied that refers to a separate resource/policy in Resource Registry (see below), read will be used as the action in the authorization check. read is also used if no authorization attribute is supplied at all. However, if a authorization attribute that does NOT refer to a separate resource/policy i Resource Registry is supplied, then transmissionread will be used as the action in the authorization check.\nThe reason for this is that the read action is usually defined for the entire resource, which will include all subresources due to the matching nature of XACML authorization \u0026ldquo;permit\u0026rdquo;-rules used in Altinn Authorization (a XACML rule defines constraints, ie. attributes that must be present in the request; an empty XACML rule will thus match - and return \u0026ldquo;permit\u0026rdquo; - any request). So in order to use authorization attributes that refer to rules within the same policy that should define separate access requirements, using something else than read is required, ie transmissionread.\nExample:\n\u0026lt;xacml:Rule RuleId=\u0026#34;urn:altinn:example:ruleid:1\u0026#34;

In the above example, the following XACML request:\n{ \u0026#34;Request\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;AccessSubject\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Attribute\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;AttributeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:rolecode\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;UTINN\u0026#34;

Using a different action, ie transmissionread, it will no longer match the first rule, and because UTINN is not part of the subject in the second rule, a Permit response will not be given and the transmission will be flagged as unaccessible by Dialogporten.\nRefer to separate resource/policy in Resource Registry If the authorization attribute value starts with either urn:altinn:resource or urn:altinn:app, and the full value differs from what ServiceResource for the given dialog is set to, the authorization attribute is considered as referring to different resources in the Resource Registry. This way, access to the various part of a dialog might be governed by different policies.\nA typical use case is having dialogs that all refer to different resources/policies, but within them contain transmissions representing a shared kind of communication (ie. notice of coercive fine) that are governed by the same authorization policy, regardless of the dialog in which it is used.\nExample:\n// First dialog { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;019275d2-1b5d-7b82-b436-4b74e5cbd02b\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;serviceResource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource:some-service\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;transmissions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;019275d3-41d5-743c-be44-aa729cf95acf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;authorizationAttribute\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource:notice-of-coervice-fine\u0026#34;, ... } ] ... } // Second dialog { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;019275d4-d550-7e93-9819-1e40579f243a\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;serviceResource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource:other-service\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;transmissions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;019275d5-0044-7b10-803a-fa5e6ac3f593\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;authorizationAttribute\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource:notice-of-coervice-fine\u0026#34;, ... } ] ... } This allows for having fine-grained control over what parts of dialogs a given role is given access to, whilst avoiding duplicating policy rules across the policies governing access to various dialog types.\n"

	"content": "Context overview The following diagram gives a high level overview of Altinn 3 Broker actors, services and information flow.\nAltinn Broker Context Diagram Explanation to the diagram:\nThe main service provided by Altinn Broker is managed file transfer from one sender (provider) to one or more recipients (consumers) with intermediary storage of files and metadata. File Upload and File Download services are configurable. All features are accessible to End User Systems via APIs. Human End Users communicate with Altinn Broker via GUIs provided by either their custom End User Systems or GUI-s provided ny Altinn Broker. Note: Service owners may choose to leverage Altinn Studio for building GUIs. End User Systems may be triggered by events via notifications to Webhooks. The same events may alternatively be detected by polling the APIs, however supporting Webhooks in the End User Systems is recommended over API polling. Service Owners configure the services and receive usage reports, invoices and other information according to the agreed service levels. Senders upload files and receive status updates about processing and delivery to recipients. Recipients receive notifications about available files. Recipients confirm successful downloads. Terminology The following table gives brief descriptions of the main terms used to describe Altinn 3 Broker. Also see https://docs.altinn.studio/en/technology/terms/ and https://data.norge.no/concepts.\nTerm Explanation Broker A \u0026lsquo;broker\u0026rsquo; facilitates transactions, negotiations, or agreements between two parties, such as buyers and sellers, or providers and consumers. Customer In the context of Altinn, \u0026lsquo;customer\u0026rsquo; is associated with \u0026lsquo;service owner\u0026rsquo;. Data Consumer A \u0026lsquo;data consumer\u0026rsquo; is an individual or system that uses data provided by data sources or services. Also see \u0026lsquo;recipient. Data Holder ‘Data holder’ means a legal person, including public sector bodies and international organisations, or a natural person who is not a data subject with respect to the specific data in question, which, in accordance with applicable law, has the right to grant access to or to share certain personal data or non-personal data. Data Provider A \u0026lsquo;data provider\u0026rsquo; is an entity that supplies or grants access to data. Also see \u0026lsquo;sender. Document A \u0026lsquo;document\u0026rsquo; refers to any form of recorded content, whether in digital or paper format, used to communicate, store, or present information, ranging from text and images to diagrams and multimedia. It serves various purposes, including legal evidence, historical records, educational material, or business transactions, facilitating the sharing and preservation of knowledge. End user An \u0026rsquo;end user\u0026rsquo; is the final consumer of the services in questions, typically human users through a graphical user interface (GUI). End user system An \u0026rsquo;end user system\u0026rsquo; provides the services and user interface for end users. File A digital container used to store, manage, and manipulate data on a computer system or network. It can consist of text, images, audio, video, or other types of data, and is typically organized within a file system that allows for easy retrieval and access. File transfer The process of moving or copying data over a computer network or through data storage devices. File transfer broker A \u0026lsquo;file transfer broker\u0026rsquo; is a system or service that acts as an intermediary to facilitate the secure and efficient exchange of files between different parties or systems. Also see \u0026lsquo;message broker\u0026rsquo;. Intermediary An \u0026lsquo;intermediary\u0026rsquo; is an entity that acts as a middleman or mediator between two parties in a transaction or communication process. Managed File Transfer (MFT) \u0026lsquo;Managed file transfer\u0026rsquo; is a solution or service that facilitates and manages the secure transfer of data between systems. It provides a more reliable and secure alternative to traditional file transfer methods, by ensuring the encryption of data in transit and at rest, and offering better management and monitoring capabilities. Message Broker A ‘message broker’ is a system or service that acts as an intermediary to facilitate message exchange between different parties or systems. On-premise \u0026lsquo;On-premise\u0026rsquo; means installation and operation of software and technology infrastructure directly within an organization\u0026rsquo;s physical facilities, rather than hosted remotely or in the cloud. Process A series of actions or steps taken to achieve a particular end. Recipient An individual or entity that receives a message, package, or service from a sender. Also see Data Consumer. Sender An individual or entity that initiates the transmission of a message or data to one or more recipients. Also see Data Provider. Service Owner In the context of Altinn, a \u0026lsquo;service owner\u0026rsquo; refers to an entity responsible for the development, management, and maintenance of a particular service within the Altinn platform. User Journey A \u0026lsquo;user journey\u0026rsquo; is a visual or narrative representation of a user\u0026rsquo;s interactions with a product or service from start to finish. Notes:\nIn the context of Altinn Broker, the terms Data Provider and Sender may be assumed to mean the same. In the context of Altinn Broker, the terms Data Consumer and recipient may be assumed to mean the same. Conceptual information model A high level conceptual information model for Altinn 3 Broker is shown in the below figure. This model is used as basis for the more detailed information model of Altinn Broker Metadata Storage.\nAltinn 3 Broker High Level Conceptual Information Model Explanation:\nThe overall File Transfer Process includes exactly one Upload Process by a Sender and one or more Download Processes corresponding to the number of Recipients. Each File Transfer Process considers one File only. The same applies for each Upload Process and Download Process. The same File may be used in several File Transfer Processes and consequently in several Download Processes. Only one Upload Process per File is considered. Note that if the same file is uploaded more than once, Altinn Broker will consider the files as different and assign different identifiers. Notifications about File Transfer Events are given to Senders and recipients depending on subscription setup. E.g. recipients may be notified about new messages, and senders may be notified about delivery events. Each File Transfer Event relates to one File Transfer Process, and consequently only one File, however any number of events may occur for the same File Transfer Process. File Transfer Process States The overall transfer process is depicted by the following model. It shows the main states and state transitions of the overall file transfer process, as relevant for Altinn Broker and status reporting to the sender.\nAltinn Broker File Transfer Processes and States The above figure depicts a Finite State Machine with the following states:\nInitialized: The transfer prosess is initialized by the sender. Note: This state machine description does not consider preceeding events. The file transfer could e.g. be a reply to a single request from a single party, or it could be a publication to an y number of known or unknown subscribers.\nUpload in Progress: Large files may take time to upload. Altinn Broker will keep track of the progress.\nUpload Processing: Uploaded files are validated and checked for viruses.\nerik ver.2 Cancelled: Altinn Broker supports cancelling of file transfers as long as no download process has started.\nPublished: Ready for downloads.\nDownloads Initiated:One or more recipients has started downloading.\nTransferFailed: The overall transfer process failed, for some reason, either during upload, upload processing or during download by one or more repepients.\nAll Confirmed Downloaded: All required recipients have confirmed download.\nDeleted: The uploaded file has been purged. This could be upon specific request by the sender, or upon agreed criteria for purging, e.g. when all required recipients have confirmed download. Note that the concept allows for files to remain in Altinn Broker File Store, to support file sharing for other purposes than a single file transfer process. In such cases, the process ends when the file has been uploaded and published, with separate processes for downloading and purging.\n"

	"description": "Displays content structured as one or more cards.",
	"content": "Usage The Cards component can be used to display various types of content (other components) in a card-based layout. It can be used to display information, images, audio, videos, and form components.\nAnatomy In the screenshot above, we see a Cards component with 4 cards.\nThe first card has a title, description, and uses an Image component to display an image as media. The second card has a title, description, and uses an Audio component to display an audio clip as media. The third card has a title, description, and uses a Video component to display a video as media. The fourth card has a title, description, and uses a Checkboxes component to display a confirmation checkbox below the description. Visually, a card will typically display content in this order:\nAt the top, a media component (e.g., image, video, audio clip) is displayed if specified (in cards[0].media). You can also change the media position to be displayed at the bottom by setting mediaPosition to bottom on the component. Below the media, the title is displayed if specified (in cards[0].title). Below the title, the description is displayed if specified (in cards[0].description). Below the description, the content of the card is displayed if specified (in cards[0].children). Below the content, any text specified in cards[0].footer is displayed. At the bottom, any media component is displayed if specified and mediaPosition is set to bottom. Style This component has several properties to control its appearance. Experiment with these settings to achieve a consistent look that complements both form and media components within the cards.\ncolor can be set on the component to control the background color of the cards. You can choose between neutral and subtle. minWidth is used to determine the minimum width of each card. The default value if not specified is 250px, and this will determine how many cards can be on a row. In addition to px, you can also use rem and % to specify the width. minMediaHeight is used to determine the minimum height of components specified in media (e.g., image, video, audio clip). The default value is 150px. Here too, you can use px, rem, and % to specify the height. Properties The following is a list of available properties for Cards.\nWe are currently updating how we implement components. The list of properties may therefore be somewhat inaccurate. Property Type Description mediaPosition string Determines the position of the media component. Can be top or bottom. Default is top. minMediaHeight string Determines the minimum height of components specified in media (e.g., image, video, audio clip). Default is 150px. minWidth string Determines the minimum width of each card. Default is 250px. color string Determines the background color of the cards. Can be neutral or subtle. cards array An array of cards to display. cards[0].title string The title of the card. cards[0].description string The description of the card. cards[0].footer string The footer text of the card. cards[0].media string The ID of a media component to display on the top/bottom of the card. cards[0].children array An array of IDs of components to display in the card.

Tittel i tabell (textResourceBindings.tableTitle): Table title. Overrides the title of the component used in column headers when the component is within repeating groups. Data Model To store and manipulate the data collected by the component, the component must be linked to a field in a data model. The option values are stored as strings.\nAltinn Studio Designer Select the field you want to link the component to from the dropdown menu. If there are no fields available, you must first upload a data model.\nCode App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MyDataModel.SomeField\u0026#34; } } Adding Options Options can be added manually or by using code lists.\nManually (options) Altinn Studio Designer Select \u0026ldquo;Manuelt\u0026rdquo; and click \u0026ldquo;Legg til flere\u0026rdquo; to add a new option. Choose or create a new text to add a label (label).\nThe option comes with a pre-filled value (value), which is the data that is stored when the user makes a selection. The value is stored as a string and can be changed as you wish.\nCode App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alternativ 1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; } ] } Code List (optionsId) A code list is a predefined list of options.\nAltinn Studio Designer To add options from a code list, select \u0026ldquo;Kodeliste\u0026rdquo; and enter a code list ID. To use a custom (dynamic) code list, click \u0026ldquo;Bytt til egendefinert kodeliste\u0026rdquo; (switch to custom code list).\nIf you wish to secure dynamic code lists, you can check this option:\nCode App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;land\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;secure\u0026#34;: true } Source (source) One way to add options is by linking the component to a code list based on form data stored within the app itself.

The grid property controls horizontal alignment based on a 12-column layout. Items are allocated fractions of 12 which sets their width relative to the screen width. In the example below, we set the component\u0026rsquo;s width to 2/12 of the screen width for all screen sizes (from xs and up).\nCode App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 2, } } You can also use grid to place items side by side.\nSee Components placed side by side (grid) for details and examples.\n"

Get access to scopes Register your Maskinporten client(s) to authenticate with the Broker API, assigning them relevant scopes:\naltinn:broker.write - For clients sending files. altinn:broker.read - For clients receiving files. These scopes are maintained by Altinn and are required to be authorized for the appropriate API operations, and as such are independent of the access set by Service Owners for the specific Broker Service Resource.\nTo obtain access to scopes, you must submit a request to: servicedesk@altinn.no. Please include all necessary scopes in your request. For example, beyond altinn:broker-scopes, your integration may require additional scopes. You can find the complete list of available scopes here: Complete list of scopes\n2. Register your Maskinporten Client with correct scopes Use Samarbeidsportalen self-service for registration. Here\u0026rsquo;s a detailed guide.\nTest environments Production environment 3. Get access to specific resource Contact the Service owner for the Broker Resource and ask for access to the Resource, supplying them with:\nOrganization number you will represent System user This will in the future be handled by System User / Resource Registry /Access Lists through GUI. If you are a service owner creating your first Broker Service; skip to the Service Owner guide.\n4. Integrate against Broker API You are now ready to start integrating against the Broker APIs, see the developer guides for next steps.\n5. Set up Event Subscriptions In order to use events/webhooks for a Broker resource, you need to setup a subscription for the given resource.\nSee the developer guide for detailed instruction.\n"

	"description": "To simplify usage and avoid confusion, interaction patterns should be shared across services.",
	"content": "When users interact with a new service, they carry expectations from previous interactions. When these expectations are met, interactions between with the user and the components of the form are less demanding, which reassures the user. By not requiring learning new interactions, the user\u0026rsquo;s focus will be on the content of the form.\nWe do not recommend changing the CSS for individual services that use the Altinn-design. Allowing\nchanges to the design and colour would hurt the consistency between services. Common designs between service owners is something that we should strive for. To achieve a common framework, cooperation between Altinn employees and service owners is required.\nWe wish for a good common solution that can be used and improved by all, instead of a variety of different solutions through unique CSS-changes. This will also simplify following accessibility requirements across apps on our platform. You will be required and responsible in following all WCAG-demands, should you choose to walk away from our design.\nDo you need a new component?\nWe want everyone who is working on developing apps to contribute to our library of components with both design and code. Practically this means that Altinn is accepting suggestions of new components requested by service owners according to their needs.\nOpprett en sak i github Skriv til oss på Slack "

	"description": "Explain what is needed to fill the form correctly to the user and divide the content into multiple steps.",
	"content": "The user should not need an error message to understand what is required to fill out the application correctly. It should be obvious in the informative text at the start of the form and in the labels for each input field.\nYou should usually only ask about information that is strictly required to complete the task of the form. With this in mind, you should inform the user of which fields are mandatory and which are not. One suggested way to do this is to write (voluntary) in either the title or in an explanation of the input field.\nDivide the content into multiple steps and use paths One long page with too much information and multiple tasks can quickly overwhelm a user. Try to divide your service up into pages in a way where the user only has one task per page. This can for example be a question that the user has to answer or important information that the user must be aware of. This simplifies the process for the user by only giving them one thing to focus on and understand at a time.\nThe design we are currently offering has been created with this concept in mind. Altinn 2 style sheets can also be created within the Altinn 3 platform, but larger amounts of total components can lead to large amounts of scrolling and a more confusing experience for the user, and short pages with less content help remedy this confusion. Example: starting a sole proprietorship.\nThe user should not be required to give more information than necessary. If the user has answered a question that leads to another, you can decide to hide or show the question (or page) depending on their answer with dynamic expressions.\nDisabled By showing fields as disabled you might expect that users know why they can\u0026rsquo;t use the element, but this is not always the case. Some users do not understand that a field is deactivated, which can lead to further confusion. Because of this we recommend limiting your use of disabling elements, and possibly including a text to explain why it is disabled, should you choose to use this feature.\n"

	"description": "Overview over the CustomButton component",
	"content": " ⚠️ Custom actions is under active development. This functionality is not configurable directly in Altinn Studio yet, and must be configured manually in the JSON files.\nIntroduction The CustomButton component provides a way to define custom behaviour tied to the clicking of a button. The component lets you define a list of actions that will be executed when the button is clicked. These actions are separated into two types: ClientActions and ServerActions. The ClientActions are executed on the client-side, and have predefined functionality such as navigating to a new page. The ServerActions are executed on the server-side, and have entirely custom functionality that you define yourself. The ServerActions can also return a list of ClientActions which execute after the server-side action has finished.\nAnatomy This example is taken from Altinn Studio Komponenter. Note that the example is not identical to the actual code but has been adapted to create prototypes in Figma.\nClientActions Client actions are predefined functionality that can be executed on the client-side. They are called by adding an action to the actions propertiy of the CustomButton component. It is important to specify that the action is a ClientAction by setting the type property to ClientAction. This is how you do that:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;custom-button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CustomButton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;custom-button-title\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nextPage\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ClientAction\u0026#34; } ] } Client actions can also receive parameters. You can pass a parameter to a client action by using the metadata property. The object metadata will be passed to the function as an argument. This is how you do that:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;custom-button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CustomButton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;custom-button-title\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;navigateToPage\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ClientAction\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;page\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;page-2\u0026#34; } } ] } A client action exists for the purpose of closing a subform. You can add the option to validate before exiting. A standard use case would be to have two buttons in the subform, e.g. Exit and Done, where Exit would not validate. This will allow the user to return to the main form without having to fill out the subform. Here is how you would add a button with this action:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;close-subform-done\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CustomButton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;custom-button-title\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ClientAction\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;closeSubform\u0026#34;, // Validation is optional \u0026#34;validation\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;page\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;all\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;show\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;All\u0026#34;] } } ] } These are the available ClientActions:\nFunction name Parameters Behavior nextPage - Will navigate to the next page, if it exists previousPage - Will navigate to the previous page, if it exists navigateToPage { page: string } Navigates to the specified page if it exists closeSubform optional validation Closes the subform and returns to the main form ServerActions Server actions are entirely custom, and can be configured to do whatever you want. This is how you define a ServerAction:\nDefine a custom ServerAction that implements the IUserAction interface:\nusing System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Models.UserAction; namespace Altinn.App.Actions; public class FillAction : IUserAction { public string Id =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;fill\u0026#34;; public async Task\u0026lt;UserActionResult\u0026gt; HandleAction(UserActionContext context) { // Do whatever you want here // Return a UserActionResult: var userActionResult = UserActionResult.SuccessResult(new List\u0026lt;ClientAction\u0026gt;()); // Return an updated datamodel if any fields have changed: userActionResult.AddUpdatedDataModel(dataId, data); return userActionResult; } } Register your custom server action in the Program.cs class\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;IUserAction, FillAction\u0026gt;(); Add the server action to the actions property of the CustomButton component:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;custom-button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CustomButton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;custom-button-title\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;fill\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ServerAction\u0026#34; } ] } Returning client actions A ServerAction can also return a list of ClientActions that will be executed on the client-side after the server-side action has finished. This is useful if you want to navigate to a new page after the server-side action has finished. This is how you do that:\nusing System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Models.UserAction; namespace Altinn.App.Actions; public class FillAction : IUserAction { public string Id =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;fill\u0026#34;; public async Task\u0026lt;UserActionResult\u0026gt; HandleAction(UserActionContext context) { var userActionResult = UserActionResult.SuccessResult(new List\u0026lt;ClientAction\u0026gt; { ClientAction.NextPage }); return userActionResult; } } Order of execution: The actions are executed in the order they are defined in the actions property of the CustomButton component. If a ServerAction returns a list of ClientActions, these will be executed after the server-side action has finished, and before the next action in the list is executed. You can chain as many actions as you want together.\nInstructions for Adding serverAction to Desired Process Step Adding serverAction to \u0026ldquo;Task_1\u0026rdquo; in the process.bpmn file: Open the process.bpmn file and add serverAction to the desired process step, such as \u0026ldquo;Task_1\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026lt;bpmn:task id=\u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;Utfylling\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;SequenceFlow_1n56yn5\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;SequenceFlow_1oot28q\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskType\u0026gt;data\u0026lt;/altinn:taskType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action type=\u0026#34;serverAction\u0026#34;\u0026gt;fill\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:task\u0026gt; Adding serverAction id to desired step in the policy.xml file: Navigate to the policy.xml file to add the serverAction id to the desired step, such as \u0026ldquo;Task_1\u0026rdquo;:\n\u0026lt;xacml:Match MatchId=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-equal\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AttributeValue DataType=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\u0026#34;\u0026gt;fill\u0026lt;/xacml:AttributeValue\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xacml:AttributeDesignator AttributeId=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id\u0026#34; Category=\u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:attribute-category:action\u0026#34; DataType=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\u0026#34; MustBePresent=\u0026#34;false\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:Match\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xacml:AllOf\u0026gt; "

	"description": "A data model describes a collection of data fields",
	"content": "A data model is a structured description of what data should be collected and how that data is related. In the context of a form (for example, an online registration or application form), the data model describes the content of the form — that is, what information the user is expected to provide—but it does not specify how the form is visually designed or laid out.\nThe data model serves as a framework or blueprint for identifying what kind of information is relevant to collect. For instance, a data model might define that data such as name, date of birth, email address, and answers to certain questions should be collected. It also specifies the types of these fields (e.g., text, date, number) and any rules, such as whether a field is required or must be within a specific range. This contributes to ensuring that the collected data is of good quality.\nAlthough the data model and the visual design of the form often correspond, there isn\u0026rsquo;t always a one-to-one match. In some cases, the data model may mirror the form exactly—each form field has a corresponding definition in the model. In other cases, the data model may be more abstract or complex than the form itself—for example, if multiple forms feed into a shared model, or if the same model is used across different forms.\nThe purpose of a data model is to ensure consistency, structure, and reusability of data. It provides developers, designers, and system owners with a shared understanding of what information needs to be handled and how it should be organized, regardless of how the form appears to the user.\n"

	"description": "Learn about how Dialogporten uses a common model to express a state of a digital dialogue",
	"content": "Introduction This section explains the dialog model and its components from a functional standpoint. For technical information for the various entities, see links within each section of this page.\nFor step-by-step guides on how to use Dialogporten as a end-user or service owner, see the user guides.\nThe dialog The dialog is an abstract and common model for all ongoing or completed communications with a service owners, and contains descriptive metadata, e.g., who is the receiving party, addresses (URL), textual content (title, summary etc), date, status, a list of relevant actions that the user can perform, and an optional list of transmissions. Actions can be arbitrarily defined by the service provider, and all interaction with the dialog takes place in the service provider\u0026rsquo;s user interfaces or against the service provider\u0026rsquo;s API endpoints (except for GUI actions that describe write operations, see more about this in the section Actions).\nAn important difference from Altinn Correspondence is that dialogs in Dialogporten are mutable. The service provider can update the metadata and available actions on the dialog at any time (with some notable exceptions). Any change generates events, which authorized parties can act on, e.g., sending a notification or having an EUS perform an action.\nDialogs use UUIDv7 as its identifier. The service owner can specify the desired UUIDv7 upon creation to enable the use of the same identifier across systems and ensure idempotency. The date portion of the UUIDv7 cannot be set to a future date.\nRead more\nReference information about the dialog aggregate root Content While the dialog mainly contains metadata, there is some content, namely a title, a short summary and a field for \u0026ldquo;additional information\u0026rdquo;, used for providing non-personal textual information, eg. service owner contact information or links to documentation.\nAdditionally, a dialog may contain a content reference called a front channel embeds, which is a URL to a special endpoint provided by the service owner that returns a \u0026ldquo;full\u0026rdquo; personlized content payload.\nTransmissions A transmission is used to describe a single \u0026ldquo;communication\u0026rdquo; between the service owner and the party within a dialog Transmissions can typically be messages, pre-filled forms and receipts from the service provider, or submitted forms/messages from the party related to the dialog. The dialog may contain zero or more transmissions represented in a chronologically sorted list. Each transmission and the list of transmissions are immutable; it is only possible to append new tranmissions to the list, not change or delete transmissions.\nA transmission contains some textual metadata (title, summary) that explains what the transmission is, including front channel embeds. Additionally, a transmission may contain one or more attachments.\nTransmissions will by default inherit the authorization policy for the dialog itself, but this may be overridden such that individual transmissions are indicated as unavaiable if the end-user lacks privileges, in which case only the metadata is available, but not any front-channel embeds or attachments.\nAPI actions and activity log entries may refer to single transmissions.\nRead more\nReference information about the transmission entity Attachments Attachments are files referenced by one or more URLs, supporting various representations of the same logical resource (ie. various formats, such as PDF, XML, JSON etc), for either GUI-consumers (ie. end user in web browser) or API-consumers (structured formats for custom end user systems). In addition to the URLs, there are some describing metadata that can be used to identity what the attachment is.\nAttachments can be used on both transmission and dialog level.\nRead more\nReference information about the attachment entity Actions An action describes an interaction that users can perform with or related to a dialog. Examples of actions are \u0026ldquo;Open\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Start signing\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Pay\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Confirm\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Learn more\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Cancel\u0026rdquo;, etc. The list of relevant actions is part of the structured description of a dialog and can be changed at any time by the service provider through the API.\nAn action is either a \u0026ldquo;GUI\u0026rdquo; action or an \u0026ldquo;API\u0026rdquo; action. All actions - both GUI and API - have an identifier that maps to an action (and optionally an authorization attribute) in the authorization policy (XACML associated with a service resource.\nGUI Actions GUI actions are meant to be used with browser based end-user systems (portals), which are usually made visible to the user in the form of buttons, links, or similar interactive elements. The service provider specifies whether a given action is to be considered a primary, secondary, or tertiary action, which affects how it is presented to the user. A primary action will typically be presented as a highlighted button (\u0026ldquo;call to action\u0026rdquo;) and is used for the logical next step. A secondary action (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Cancel\u0026rdquo;) can be a more subdued button or text link, while a tertiary action (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Learn more about this service\u0026rdquo;) can be hidden behind a dropdown menu or similar. All this is up to the particular GUI used to evaluate, and different evaluations may be made depending on the \u0026ldquo;view\u0026rdquo; - i.e., context, intended user group, etc.\nAll GUI actions have a URL. These URLs are used in the front channel (ie. the browser) when the user activates the action, and involve the user being redirected to the service provider\u0026rsquo;s own user interface where the action is performed, either automatically or as a result of further user interaction. This redirection always occurs with a GET request, ensuring that any existing sessions with the service provider are used (i.e., that browsers will send session cookies), and that redirection via SSO login in ID-porten works. These URLs must therefore return either redirects or HTML, and since it is a GET request, it is not recommended that these actions directly result in state changes.\nGUI actions can, however, be marked as write operations and can then also be used to make state changes.\nRead more\nLearn how write actions are used to provide a more integrated user experience Reference information for the GUI action entity API Actions An API action is intended for EUSs and portals that use Dialogporten through their own integration and allows defining actions that result in direct state changes and take complex input that cannot be performed directly with a browser due to security mechanisms. API actions are versioned and contain a list of endpoints that can be called, possibly with information about whether an endpoint is being phased out and when this will happen. Each action also contains an identifier indicating what type of action it is, and each endpoint indicates which URL must be called to perform the action. The endpoint also contains information about which HTTP operation to use (typically GET or POST), and optionally a link to a structured description (e.g., JSON Schema) of the data model that is either returned or expected as input, which can be used for documentation purposes.\nDialogporten does not validate any data and does not see what data flows between the EUS and the service provider\u0026rsquo;s API. Read more\nReference information for the API action entity Activities An activity describes an action or event that has occurred in connection with the dialog. Each activity is part of the activity history, which is a chronological list of activities. The service provider populates the activity history as various state changes occur.\nRead more\nLearn about how Dialogporten provides a activity log for each dialog Refererence information about the dialog activity entity Dialog labels Dialogs can be assigned various labels that users may employ in order to organize their dialogs in order to make it easier to keep track and collaborate with each other.\nLabels does not affect the state of the actual dialog; ie. its status, content or progress, and cannot be used to advance or otherwise affect the dialog process as defined by the service owner. It is merely a mechanism to enable dialog organization by allowing the user interface to create views based on dialog labels. There are two main categories of labels; user defined labels and system labels.\nUser defined labels User defined labels are administered by the users, and may be shared with other users. Some user defined labels have global effect (ie. visible for everyone with access to the dialog), while other are personal (ie. only visible for the user owning the labels.)\nUser defined label functionality is under design, and will be made available at a later stage. See the news section for updated information. System labels System labels are predefined, global labels defined by Dialogporten. These may be assigned to any dialog by any user with write access to the dialog in question. Currently there are three system labels defined; Archive and Bin and Default. Assigning Archive or Bin labels will typically hide the dialog from the ordinary inbox views, and will make them available in other views. These system labels are mutually exclusive (ie. it can only have one of these labels at any time). By default, all dialogs will have the label Default, which indicates that default view/handling of the dialog should be applied.\nCommon for these two system labels is that any change made to the dialog by the service owner will reset them to Default. Ie. if a user decides to place a dialog in the bin, and the service owner subsequently updates it with more information, the dialog will again be visible in the ordinary views as if the Bin label was never assigned.\nLabel log Dialogporten keeps track of labellings, logging who performed them and at what time it was performed. This includes resetting of system labels due to dialog updates.\nRead more\nReference information about the system label entity "

	"description": "Input element that allows a user to select only one option from a number of choices",
	"content": "🚧 This documentation is a work in progress. Usage Dropdown lists are often used in forms to collect input from users where they need to choose only one of several options from a list.\nUse Cases:\nWhen the user can choose only one of several options. When the list of options is too long to display as radio buttons (see Related). For navigation menus. Anatomy Heading - Question or instruction. Description - Here you can describe it. Trigger - Click to open the menu. Option title - Main title for the option. Option description - Here you can describe the option. Selcted option - Indication of the selected option. Best Practices List options in a logical order: most likely to least likely to be selected simplest to most complex operation least to most risk Preselect one option. Choose the safest, most secure, and private option first. If safety and security are not important, choose the most likely or convenient option. If users should have the option to avoid making a selection, add a \u0026ldquo;None\u0026rdquo; (or equivalent) option. If you cannot have a list of all possible options, add an \u0026ldquo;Other\u0026rdquo; option. Avoid alphabetical sorting as it is language-dependent and not localizable. Avoid overlapping options. For example, Select age: 0-20, 20-40 — What do you choose if your age is 20? Include all relevant options. For example, Select age: Below 20, Above 20 — What do you choose if you are 20? Content Guidance Keep labels short and descriptive. Start all labels with a capital letter. Do not include punctuation after labels. Related For single selection with few options, use RadioButtons. If users can choose multiple options from a list, use Checkboxes. For a more compact way to display multiple options with multiple selections, use MultipleSelect.

	"title": "File validation",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "How to do extended file validation?",
	"content": "This functionality requires that the application uses at least version 7.10.0 of the Altinn.App.Core and Altinn.App.Api NuGet packages. By enabling this feature you change the response body type from string to json. You will still get the same http status code, but the body will contain an array of json objects describing the error. Introduction By default, before a file is uploaded and actually stored, only simple validation is done to ensure the file adheres to the rules set on the data type and/or upload component. These checks includes:\nIs the file extension valid according the the configured mime types The file size is below the configured limit Number of files uploaded is below the configured limit Extended file validation adds extension points to analyse the uploaded files byte stream before it\u0026rsquo;s stored and return an error messages to the client if something is wrong. By default a mime type checker is included that scans the file to see if it is the type it claims to be. But any custom analyser can be written to validate different types of files and different metadata. You could for example write an analyser that checks if a png file has a minimum resolution before it\u0026rsquo;s accepted or that a pdf file is of a specific version.\nThe Altinn.App.Core NuGet package only defines the interfaces required in addition to making sure the code is called. The analyser implementations are created as a separate NuGet package that can be imported into your application. This is done to keep the core of an Altinn 3 application as small as possible and to be able to release and use new analysers without depending on having to upgrade the application (beyond v7.10.0).\nHow to configure and enable the default mimetype validation in your application Add reference to Altinn.FileAnalyzers nuget package\nOpen command line to the repo of your application and navigate to the App folder where the App.csproj file is located and run the following command: nuget install Altinn.FileAnalyzers Register the mime type analyzer services.AddMimeTypeValidation(); Configure the the analyzer for the datatype it should be used for\nThe analyzer is configured on a per datatype basis and will only run against the configured datatype. The example below configures the mime type analyzer and it\u0026rsquo;s corresponding validator. { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;08112113-cc3a-4d35-a8d2-bfba53a1ddfd\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;image/jpeg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;application/pdf\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxSize\u0026#34;: 25, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;enablePdfCreation\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;enabledFileAnalysers\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;mimeTypeAnalyser\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;enabledFileValidators\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;mimeTypeValidator\u0026#34; ] } Add support for json objects in data response\nThis will tell the frontend to look for json in the response in order to provide an error message to the user. \u0026#34;FeatureManagement\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;JsonObjectInDataResponse\u0026#34;: true } How to write your own analyser If you would like to write your own analyser you need to implement two interfaces: IFileAnalyser and IFileValidator. The analyser analyses the file for any metadata you would like to extract and returns this in a FileAnalysisResult which in turn is passed into the validator implementation. The validator then only validates based on the extracted metadata. The result contains a few fixed metadata properties - filename, mimetype and the id of the analyser used to create the result. Any additional metadata is passed as key/value pairs in the Metadata property. This separation is primarily done to allow for the re-use of the analyser to extract metadata about the file for other usage.\nImplement the IFileAnalyser interface\nThe interface has one property Id and one method Analyse that needs to be implemented.\nThe Id property should be unique is used when you configure the analyser in the applicationmetadata.json file. This is how your implementation is resolved when the application figures out which analyser to run on a given data type.\nExample from the default implementation of the mimetype analyser: public string Id { get; private set; } = \u0026#34;mimeTypeAnalyser\u0026#34;; The Analyse method will be passed in a stream representing the file and a filename if available (normally is). The stream is already set to position 0 and can be read directly.\nExample from the default implementation of the mimetype analyser: public async Task\u0026lt;FileAnalysisResult\u0026gt; Analyse(Stream stream, string? filename = null) { var results = _inspector.Inspect(stream); var match = results.OrderByDescending(match =\u0026gt; match.Points).FirstOrDefault(match =\u0026gt; match.Percentage == 1); // You provide the id of the analyser in the result to allow to distinguish between results from different analysers. var fileAnalysisResult = new FileAnalysisResult(Id); if (match != null) { fileAnalysisResult.Extensions = match.Definition.File.Extensions.ToList(); fileAnalysisResult.MimeType = match.Definition.File.MimeType; fileAnalysisResult.Filename = filename; fileAnalysisResult.Metadata.Add(\u0026#34;key\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;); //This is just provided to show how you add custom metadata. } return fileAnalysisResult; } Implement the IFileValidator interface\nBased on the analysis result you can write a validator. The validator will be tightly coupled to the metadata properties you would like to validate against, meaning you will need to know the key and type of values to expect.\nThe interface has one property Id and one method Validate that needs to be implemented.\nThe Id property should be unique is used when you configure the analyser in the applicationmetadata.json file. This is how your implementation is resolved when the application figures out which validator to run on a given data type.\nExample from the default implementation of the mimetype validator: public string Id { get; private set; } = \u0026#34;mimeTypeValidator\u0026#34;; The Validate method will be passed in the data type it runs for and the result from the analysis. It returns a bool indicating if the validation was successful or not, and in the case of an error a list of errors will be returned. public async Task\u0026lt;(bool Success, IEnumerable\u0026lt;ValidationIssue\u0026gt; Errors)\u0026gt; Validate(DataType dataType, IEnumerable\u0026lt;FileAnalysisResult\u0026gt; fileAnalysisResults) { List\u0026lt;ValidationIssue\u0026gt; errors = new(); var fileMimeTypeResult = fileAnalysisResults.FirstOrDefault(x =\u0026gt; x.MimeType != null); // Verify that file mime type is an allowed content-type if (!dataType.AllowedContentTypes.Contains(fileMimeTypeResult?.MimeType, StringComparer.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !dataType.AllowedContentTypes.Contains(\u0026#34;application/octet-stream\u0026#34;)) { ValidationIssue error = new() { Source = \u0026#34;File\u0026#34;, Code = ValidationIssueCodes.DataElementCodes.ContentTypeNotAllowed, Severity = ValidationIssueSeverity.Error, Description = $\u0026#34;The {fileMimeTypeResult?.Filename + \u0026#34; \u0026#34;}file does not appear to be of the allowed content type according to the configuration for data type {dataType.Id}. Allowed content types are {string.Join(\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;, dataType.AllowedContentTypes)}\u0026#34;, CustomTextKey = \u0026#34;My.text.resource.key\u0026#34; }; errors.Add(error); return (false, errors); } return (true, errors); } Register you implementation in the applications dependency container\nOnce you have your code in place you need to register your implementation in order for the code to be executed when uploading files. services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IFileAnalyser, YourAnalyserImplementation\u0026gt;(); services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IFileValidator, YourValidatorImplementation\u0026gt;(); Configure your analyser and validator\nThe last part is to configure your analyser for the datatype you need it to run against. Open the applicationmetadata.json file and configure the analyser and validator. { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;08112113-cc3a-4d35-a8d2-bfba53a1ddfd\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;image/jpeg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;application/pdf\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxSize\u0026#34;: 25, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;enablePdfCreation\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;enabledFileAnalysers\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;mimeTypeAnalyser\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;enabledFileValidators\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;mimeTypeValidator\u0026#34; ] } "

	"content": "Innen juni 2025 så skal dagens Altinn løsning være modernisert og migrert til skyen. Det innebærer at mye av dagens løsning må utvikles på nytt.\nOverordnet målsetning for modernisering Autorisasjon skal være en selvstendig komponent og eget produkt Sikre en robust og sikker drift samtidig som vi understøtter stor vekst i bruken av autorisasjon. Øke endringstakten i Autorisasjon slik at veien fra behov til løsning blir raskere. Forbedre og forenkle brukerflyten slik at det blir enklere å administrere tilganger Tilby nye og moderne API som gjør det enklere å integrere mot og ta i bruk Altinn Autorisasjon som tilgangsstyringløsning for andre offentlige tjenester Hva skal gjøres? For å sikre fremtidige behov så tegnes det en ny arkitektur for Altinn Autorisasjon, se ny løsningsarkitektur\nMigrering av tjenester fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3 Alle tjenester som i dag bruker Altinn som autorisasjonsløsning må flyttes fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3 plattformen. Det er laget en egen plan for hvilken rekkefølge dette skal skje og når de enkelte tjenestene skal være ferdig migrert.\nNye tilgangspakker og ny brukerflate for tilgangsstyring for virksomheter Dette arbeidet vil starte opp Q1 2023. Målet er å lansere ney tilgangspakker Q4 2024 og ny brukerflate Q1 2025.\nI dag administrerer hvem som kan opptre på virksomhetens vegne i Altinns profil. Denne brukerflaten vil få et nytt utseende i Altinn 3.\nForslag til ny brukerflate på skissestadiet Dagens roller i Altinn 2.0 er forholdsvis store og rommer tilgang til veldig mange tjenester. I tilegg skal Altinn styre tilgang til mange tusen tjenester. Resultatet er at dette kan oppleves som forvirrende, overveldende, usikkert og frusterende for enkelte tilgansstyrere.\nDen nye brukerflaten i Altinn Autorisasjon har som mål å tilby en tilrettelagt og nøyaktig tilgangsstyring som forenkle arbeidsflyten og oppleves som betyrggende for brukeren. Dette skal også sikre at man ikke får tilgang til mer enn man strengt tatt trenger.\nEn konsekvens av dette er at dagens roller i Altinn 2.0 skal fases ut og erstattes med nye tilgangspakker i Altinn 3.0\nHva blir konsekvensen av at man innfører nye tilgangspakker? I forkant av lansering av nye tilgangspakker og i en overgangsfase vil det være nødvendig å angi både gamle Altinn 2.0 roller og nye 3.0 tilgangspakker som rollekrav knyttet til tjenesten. Det betyr at en bruker enten kan få tilgang til en tjeneste fordi vedkommende har en gammel 2.0 rolle eller fordi hun har fått en ny 3.0 tilgangspakke.\nDet vil fortsatt være mulig å delegere Altinn 2.0 roller etter at vi lanserer tilgangspakkene, så lenge det finnes tjenester i løsningen som benytter Altinn 2.0-roller. Dette er for å gi tjenesteeiere tilstrekkelig tid til å flytte tjenestene sine fra Altinn 2.0 til Altinn 3.0 (i Altinn Studio eller som ressurser i ressursregisteret). Tilgangspakkene vil tilgjengeliggjøres i Altinn Studio og ressursregisteret, og kan tas i bruk på tjenester fra begynnelsen av Q2-24, men må i en overgangsfase benyttes på tjenestene sammen med Altinn 2.0-roller. Dette skyldes at brukerflaten for å administrere tilganger til tjenester med tilgangspakker ikke blir tilgjengelig før på et senere tidspunkt, og sluttbrukerne må derfor tilgangsstyre med Altinn 2.0-roller i denne perioden. Etter at brukerflaten for tilgangsstyring er lansert, vil det ikke være mulig å benytte Altinn 2.0-roller på tjenester/ressurser som etableres på Altinn 3.0.\nVi vil utvikle en veileder og informasjonmateriell som skal hjelpe virksomheter i overgangen mellom Altinn 2.0-roller og Altinn 3.0-tilgangspakker, slik at de unngår at ansatte mister nødvendige tilganger når Altinn 2.0-rollene fases ut. Virksomhetene kommer til å få god tid til å rydde opp gamle 2.0 roller som er delegert før disse fjernes.\nNye Tilgangspakker og ny brukerflate for tilgangsstyring for innbyggere Dette arbeidet starter Q4 2024.\nI dag administrerer innbygger hvem som kan opptre på egne vegne i Altinns profil. Denne brukerflaten har høy brukerterskel for mange innbyggere og i forbindelse med migrering til Altinn 3 så vil denne gjøres om. I ny brukerflate vil man legge større vekt på behov som innbyggere har.\nMigrering av autorative kilder/registre og ta i bruk nye autorative kilder Dette arbeidet starter Q3 2024.\nI dag har Altinn en kopi av Enhetsregisteret og Folkeregisteret som er vår autorative kilde for å si hvem som i utgangspunktet har fullmakt til opptre på vegne av en virksomhet. Disse registrene skal flyttes fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3 plattfromen.\nI forbindelse med migrering av våre Autorative kilder vil man sikre at det blir enklere å ta i bruk andre autorative kilder for å gi tilgang til tjenester via Altinn Autorisasjon. Disse nye kildene kan være kopier som etableres i Altinn Autorisasjon eller det kan skje ved oppslag mot eksterne registre som vi har tilgang til.\nFølgende nye klider er aktuelle som nye autorative kilder, men nye kilder vil ikke implementeres før vi er ferdig med å flytte basisfunksjonalitet fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3:\nVergemål (dette får vi fra Folkeregisteret når FReg reetableres på Altinn 3), Advokatregisteret (Tilsynsrådet for advokater), Arbeidstaker og arbeidsgiverregisteret (NAV), Fullmaktsregister for innbygger hos eHelse, Fullmaktsregister for innbyggere hos NAV "

These rules will in the future be replaced by dynamic expressions. Currently only show/hide dynamics are supported using expressions, but calculation and validation will be supported in the future.\nLogic menu For backend the logic is done by implementing various interfaces. These are described in separate chapters for example in data processing. A complete project with examples on server-side application logic can be found in our training course application.\nNOTE: The way you reference elements in the data model is different between OR and SERES type XSD\u0026rsquo;s. For OR XSD\u0026rsquo;s, .value is a necessary suffix in the reference. The example code below uses a mixture of the two types of data models.\nAuto-complete/intellisense By editing the source code in the apps locally, e.g. in Visual Studio Code, you get intellisense and autocomplete automatically. For the C#-files, it\u0026rsquo;s easiest working on these locally.\nFor the javascript-files, intellisense/autocomplete is also available if you wish to edit the files directly in Altinn Studio. This appears automatically when writing, and you can also force it to appear by pressing CTRL + SPACE\nLogic menu - auto-complete/intellisense "

To start with a 2x2 Grid having two columns and two rows, we can use the following configuration:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myGrid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Grid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;rows\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;cells\u0026#34;: [{ \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Cell 1\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Cell 2\u0026#34; }] }, { \u0026#34;cells\u0026#34;: [{ \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Cell 3\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Cell 4\u0026#34; }] } ] } Each cell should either be an object with a text property (for text cells), an object with a component property (referencing other components), an object with a labelFrom property (referencing other components) or null (for an empty cell). Each row must have the same amount of cell objects as every other row.\nRows On some rows, usually the first, you might want to configure a header row. To do this, add a header property to the row and set it to true. This will make the row have a different background color and make the text bold.\n{ \u0026#34;header\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;cells\u0026#34;: [{ \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Cell 1\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Cell 2\u0026#34; }] } Similarly, a row can also be configured to be read-only. This will make the row have a yellow background color. To configure a row as read-only, add a readOnly property to the row and set it to true.\n{ \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;cells\u0026#34;: [{ \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Cell 3\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Cell 4\u0026#34; }] } Note that components inside a readOnly are not automatically set to readOnly as well. If you want to make a component inside a readOnly row read-only, you need to configure it manually for that component.\nRows can also be hidden, and a whole row will automatically be hidden if the following rules are met:\nThe row has at least one component reference (not just empty cells and text cells) All component references in the row points to components that are currently hidden In other words, rows that only have text cells will never be hidden, and even if the row has text cells, these cells will not be taken into account when the Grid component decides whether to hide the row or not.\nCells Cells can be configured to be either as either text cell or a component cell. To configure a cell as a text cell, add a text property to the cell and set it to the text you want to display. You can also specify a text resource key as the text to display in the cell. Additionally, it is possible to include a help property along with the text property to provide help text for the cell. Alternatively, you can retrieve the text content from a component\u0026rsquo;s text resources by using labelFrom property with the id of the component. By specifying a labelFrom you can retrieve text resources such as title, description, and help.\nTo configure a cell as a component cell, add a component property to the cell and set it to the id of the component you want to display in the cell.\n{ \u0026#34;cells\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Text content in cell 1\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text.resource.key\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Text content in cell 3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;help\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Help text for cell 3\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;labelFrom\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myComponent\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;component\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myComponent\u0026#34; } ] } In the above configuration, the myComponent is assumed to be a component that is configured elsewhere in the layout. Currently, a selection of components are supported in the Grid component. These are:\nButton Checkboxes Custom (subject to the custom implementation) Datepicker Dropdown Header Image Input InstantiationButton MultipleSelect Paragraph PrintButton RadioButtons TextArea For RadioButtons and Checkboxes, the option label will not be displayed if there is only one option to choose from when being displayed inside a Grid.\nWhen displayed in a table, components will not render their title and description text resources. However, these text resources should still be set on the component, as they will be used for accessibility purposes, and will still be displayed when the component is displayed outside of a Grid - such as on smaller screens and in a Summary.\nWidths, text and alignment There ar multiple properties on a cell that can be used to control the width, text and alignment of a cell, and how much text is displayed before it is truncated. These options are:\nwidth - The width of the column. The value can contain a percentage, for example \u0026quot;25%\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;auto\u0026quot; (default). Should be set on the first column, and will then apply to all cells in that column. alignText - Choose between \u0026quot;left\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;center\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;right\u0026quot; to align the text in the cell accordingly. This has no effect for cells with components, only cells with text. textOverflow - Used to control the behavior when the text content is too large to fit in a cell. Has no effect for cells with components, only cells with text. lineWrap - The text will wrap to the next line. This is the default behavior. Set to false to disable. maxHeight - The text will be truncated after a certain number of lines. Set to 0 to disable. You can override a column\u0026rsquo;s alignText and textOverflow settings for a specific text cell by adding the attributes directly to the selected text cell.\nExample:\n{ \u0026#34;cells\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;text\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Cell 1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;width\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;25%\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alignText\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;left\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textOverflow\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;lineWrap\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;maxHeight\u0026#34;: 0 } }, { \u0026#34;component\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myComponent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;width\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;75%\u0026#34; } ] } Mobile support Components in the examples above are displayed as single components on smaller screens Grid arrangement of components is useful to give the user a better overview of the content of a page and related fields when the screen is large enough. However, such a table view is not optimal for smaller screens, so the Grid component will automatically display the components (as if they were not part of a Grid) on smaller screens. The order of the components will be the same as the order of the rows and cells in the Grid configuration (one row at a time), and the order of the components as they are defined in the layout configuration has no significance.\nThe same applies to displaying a Grid component in a Summary, where the same components referenced in the Grid will be displayed as a summary of single components.\n"

	"content": "On this page Why use the IFrame component Security and Performance Concerns Accessibility Statement Concerns Basic implementation of the IFrame component Advanced implementation of the IFrame component Sandbox restrictions Why use the IFrame component As a service developer, it may be desirable to include your own HTML and CSS in an Altinn app, for example, to display external content that should resemble the company\u0026rsquo;s branding profile that develops the app.\nNow, this is possible to achieve using the IFrame component, which allows rendering HTML and CSS into existing Altinn applications.\nTip: It might be wise to consider whether it is strictly necessary to use this component or not. It is not optimal to rely on multiple iframes in the application. The best approach is to avoid them if possible.\nSecurity and Performance Concerns It is important to note that the content within the iframe will be from a different source code than the app itself, and this can affect the performance and potentially the security of the app.\nTherefore, it is crucial to ensure that the content loaded into the iframe is reliable and secure, and that it does not contain malicious code or potentially dangerous third-party resources that you, as a service developer, do not have control over.\nAccessibility Statement Concerns As a service developer, you are responsible for ensuring that the HTML code loaded into the IFrame component complies with accessibility laws and regulations, so that all users can access the content in an easy and efficient manner. This includes making sure that the content is accessible to individuals with various disabilities, such as visual or hearing impairments, and that it is easy to navigate and use for all users.\nIt is also important to ensure that the content is accessible on all platforms and devices, including mobile and tablets. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that users have the best possible experience when using your Altinn app along with your own HTML and CSS within the iframe-component.\nBasic implementation of the IFrame component To use the IFrame component in an Altinn app, simply add the IFrame component to your layout file, as demonstrated below.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;unique-component-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;IFrame\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;simple-heading\u0026#34; } } Now, you might be wondering how to embed the HTML and CSS into the IFrame. This can be achieved by adding the desired HTML and CSS code within your text-resource file.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;simple-heading\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;html\u0026gt;\u0026lt;head\u0026gt;\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Simple Heading\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt;\u0026lt;style\u0026gt;h1 { color: red; }\u0026lt;/style\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt;\u0026lt;body\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;My simple heading\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } It is important to note that the ID specified within your text-resource file must match the title specified in the textResourceBindings section of your layout file. Now, if we visit our app, we should be able to see the IFrame component rendering a red heading with the text content \u0026ldquo;My Simple Heading.\u0026rdquo;\nAdvanced implementation of the IFrame component Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s not enough to use static HTML and CSS directly written in the text resource file. There are situations where you need to fetch HTML dynamically based on certain criteria or perform calculations. To fetch HTML dynamically, you can make use of ProcessDataRead. You can learn more about data processing here.\nProcessDataRead and Data processing provide the capability to preprocess data before it is sent back to the frontend for rendering.\nSandbox restrictions The IFrame component uses the sandbox attribute which places heavy security restrictions on the features that can be used within the iframe. These restrictions can be lifted individually by adding the desired features to the sandbox attribute. See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#sandbox. By default, allow-same-origin is enabled. Some of the other restrictions can be lifted by configuring the sandbox property on the IFrame component.\nIf you want to allow opening links in a new tab, you can use the following configuration:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;unique-component-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;IFrame\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;content-with-link\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;sandbox\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;allowPopups\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;allowPopupsToEscapeSandbox\u0026#34;: true } } Note: allowPopupsToEscapeSandbox will remove all sandbox restrictions from the popup page. Without setting this property the page will not be able to run javascript.\n"

Alternative text: Used by screen readers and displayed if the image can not be rendered. Best practices We recommend following the guidelines by UUtilsynet.\nAdd an alternative text which explains the image. The alt. text will be displayed if the image is unavailable and is used by screen readers. If an image is purely decorative, it\u0026rsquo;s best not to include an alternative text. Don\u0026rsquo;t use images for image\u0026rsquo;s sake. Ask yourself if the image illustrates a point or increases the understanding of what you are trying to tell. Check if the image scales well on devices like mobile or tablet. An image which looks good on a PC can quickly fill a smaller screen. Avoid using images instead of text, as screen readers cannot read it. Content guidelines Keep alternative texts consistent:\nNever start with \u0026ldquo;Image of \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Write short and start with the most essential part of the image. End by saying if the photo is an illustration or graphic. Example\nAlt text: \u0026ldquo;Old wooden trolley.

	"description": "Component that allows users to upload an image and crop it before it is saved",
	"content": "Usage Use the image upload component when users need to upload an image, such as a profile picture. The component has built-in functionality for cropping the image before it is saved.\nAnatomy Upload image: The user clicks on the upload area to open the file explorer and select an image from their device. Alternatively, the user can drag and drop an image directly into the upload area. Preview: After upload, a preview of the image is displayed. The user can crop the image by dragging it and zooming in/out within the specified frame, either with a mouse or a keyboard. Control panel: Below the image is a control panel with buttons to zoom in, zoom out, reset cropping and positioning, upload a new image, and save the cropped image. Save image: When the user is satisfied with the cropping, they click the «Save» button to save the cropped image. The cropped image is then displayed in the preview along with a delete button that allows the user to remove the image and upload a new one if desired. Configuration The component has some specific properties that can be configured in addition to the general properties that apply to all components. Below is a list of the most important properties:\nProperty Type Description Required Default value id string Unique ID for the component yes type string Component type, for this component it is always ImageUpload yes crop object Configuration for the cropping area no { \u0026quot;shape\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;circle\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;diameter\u0026quot;: 250 } Examples of the crop object Circular cropping (default):\n\u0026#34;crop\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;shape\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;circle\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;diameter\u0026#34;: 250 } Rectangular cropping:\n\u0026#34;crop\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;shape\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;rectangle\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;width\u0026#34;: 270, \u0026#34;height\u0026#34;: 200 } Note: For usability on smaller screens, we recommend a maximum size of 270 pixels in width for the cropping area. This ensures that users with screens down to 320 pixels wide can use the component without problems. "

This can be done by using an expression in the target property. See the following example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Link\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Confirm in altinn.no\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;concat\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;https://altinn.no/confirm?instanceId=\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;instanceContext\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instanceId\u0026#34;] ] }, \u0026#34;openInNewTab\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;style\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;primary\u0026#34; } Download Let\u0026rsquo;s say you need to offer a PDF for download, and that PDF content is found in the data model as a base64 encoded string.

The data is defined in a separate file which implements the interface IDataListProvider. This works similar to code lists/options. The field dataListId defines which data list the component refers to. The dynamic data lists kan be either open or secured. After you have written your implementation of IDataListProvider you have to register is as a service inside RegisterCustomAppServices in Program.cs Here is one example of a class that implements the interface IDataListProvider\npublic class ListCases : IDataListProvider { public string Id { get; set; } = \u0026#34;people\u0026#34;; public Task\u0026lt;DataList\u0026gt; GetDataListAsync(string language, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; keyValuePairs) { int start = 0; int count = 10; string search = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; if (keyValuePairs.ContainsKey(\u0026#34;search\u0026#34;) ) { search = keyValuePairs[\u0026#34;search\u0026#34;]; } if (keyValuePairs.ContainsKey(\u0026#34;size\u0026#34;) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; keyValuePairs.ContainsKey(\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;)) { string size = keyValuePairs[\u0026#34;size\u0026#34;]; string page = keyValuePairs[\u0026#34;page\u0026#34;]; start = int.Parse(size) * int.Parse(page); count = int.Parse(size); } List\u0026lt;ListItem\u0026gt; items = new List\u0026lt;ListItem\u0026gt;(); items.Add(new ListItem { Name = \u0026#34;Caroline\u0026#34;, Age = 28, Profession = \u0026#34;Utvikler\u0026#34; }); items.Add(new ListItem { Name = \u0026#34;Kåre\u0026#34;, Age = 37, Profession = \u0026#34;Sykepleier\u0026#34; }); items.Add(new ListItem { Name = \u0026#34;Johanne\u0026#34;, Age = 27, Profession = \u0026#34;Utvikler\u0026#34; }); items.Add(new ListItem { Name = \u0026#34;Kari\u0026#34;, Age = 56, Profession = \u0026#34;Snekker\u0026#34; }); items.Add(new ListItem { Name = \u0026#34;Petter\u0026#34;, Age = 19, Profession = \u0026#34;Personlig trener\u0026#34; }); items.Add(new ListItem { Name = \u0026#34;Hans\u0026#34;, Age = 80, Profession = \u0026#34;Pensjonist\u0026#34; }); items.Add(new ListItem { Name = \u0026#34;Siri\u0026#34;, Age = 28, Profession = \u0026#34;UX designer\u0026#34; }); items.Add(new ListItem { Name = \u0026#34;Tiril\u0026#34;, Age = 40, Profession = \u0026#34;Arkitekt\u0026#34; }); items.Add(new ListItem { Name = \u0026#34;Karl\u0026#34;, Age = 49, Profession = \u0026#34;Skuespiller\u0026#34; }); items.Add(new ListItem { Name = \u0026#34;Mette\u0026#34;, Age = 33, Profession = \u0026#34;Artist\u0026#34; }); if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(search)) { items = items.Where(o =\u0026gt; (o.Name == search)).ToList(); } if (keyValuePairs.ContainsKey(\u0026#34;sortDirection\u0026#34;)) { string sortDirection = keyValuePairs[\u0026#34;sortDirection\u0026#34;]; if (sortDirection == \u0026#34;asc\u0026#34;) { items = items.OrderBy(o =\u0026gt; o.Age).ToList(); } else if (sortDirection == \u0026#34;desc\u0026#34;) { items = items.OrderBy(o =\u0026gt; o.Age).ToList(); items.Reverse(); } } DataListMetadata appListsMetaData = new DataListMetadata() { TotaltItemsCount = items.Count }; List\u0026lt;object\u0026gt; objectList = new List\u0026lt;object\u0026gt;(); items.ForEach(o =\u0026gt; objectList.Add(o)); int boundedCount = start + count \u0026gt; items.Count ? items.Count - start : count; return Task.FromResult(new DataList { ListItems = objectList.GetRange(start, boundedCount), _metaData = appListsMetaData }); } } To register this example as a service you would add services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IDataListProvider, ListCases\u0026gt;(); in the RegisterCustomAppServices method located in Program.cs In this example the list is created in code, but it is also possible to call an API which returns that data to be presented in the table. If this API supports sorting, pagination and search, you can pass this variables to the API to avoid fetching unnecessary data.\nColumns The table columns is defined in the component with the field tableHeaders. It is an object, where the keys correspond to fields in your data model representing a row. In the example above the model is ListItem with name, age and profession as fields. To support multiple languages this array can be populated with keys from the language files. For the content of the cells to match the header, you need to make sure that the table data is structured in the same order as the table headers.\nSorting In layout.json you define which columns should be sortable with the field sortableColumns. This is an array of strings, and the strings you use here also has to be defined as a header in the field tableHeaders. When a column is sortable the column header will have an arrow to show the direction of the sorting. The sorting logic you will have to implement your self. The method GetDataListAsync takes the parameter keyValuePairs which contains sortDirection and sortColumn for this purpose. This logic can be implemented directly in the GetDataListAsync method, like in the previous example, or you can forward the sorting parameters to an external API you use.\nPagination To define pagination you use the field pagination, which takes an object as value. In this object you define alternatives with an array of numbers which represents the choices the user will have for number of rows in the table. In addition you define default which is the default of how many rows to be shown in the list. In the same way as with sorting, the pagination logic need to be implemented for the correct data to show. The parameter keyValuePairs consists of the values size and page for this.\nSearch For a user to be able to search the list, you need to add a text field of type search. This text field is connected to a field in the data model, and then this value in the data model can be used for search. I the list component you need to add the field mapping. An example of this:\n\u0026#34;mapping\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;soknad.navn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;search\u0026#34; } The value of the data model field soknad.navn will then be sent as a key value pair with the key search. OBS! The mapping field can also be used to send any other query parameters.\nHow to store data in the data model The selected row is stored in the data model. You choose which column/cell values to store. Each column is stored in a separate field in the data model. This is defined with the field dataModelBindings:\n\u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SelectedItem\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;profession\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SelectedItemProfession\u0026#34; }, SelectedItem and SelectedItemProfession are fields in the data model, and name and profession are properties in the model used to describe a row in this case. In the example shown here it is created a model to present a row like this:\npublic class ListItem { public string Name { get; set; } public int Age { get; set; } public string Profession { get; set; } } List component in the summary If you want to show the selected row from the list component in the form summary, it will be shown simply with only one value. Which value is defined with the property bindingToShowInSummary, and will look like this:\nList component in summary Secured data lists In the same way as with code lists, you can secure the data list if they contain sensitive data. You then use the interface IInstanceDataListProvider for the class, and add the secure boolean to the component in layout.json.\nMobile view The table is quite compressed in mobile view, and you can therefore choose which fields to show on mobile. That is done with the field tableHeadersMobile, an array of strings representing the header and header values to show on mobile.\nUsing checkboxes in List To use List with checkboxes you have to add the dataModelBinding group. This should point to a repeating group structure in the data model, in other words a list of objects.\nThe other data model bindings in the List component should then have unique keys that points to properties within that repeating group structure.\nDatamodelbinding \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;person\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pofession\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;person.profession\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;person.name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;person.age\u0026#34; } Design Image of List component with checkboxes "

The documentation is continuously updated, and there may be more settings available than what is described here, and some settings may be in beta version. Add component Altinn Studio Designer You can add a component in Altinn Studio Designer by dragging it from the list of components to the page area. Selecting the component brings up its configuration panel. Code Basic component:\nApp/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, { \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MultipleSelect-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MultipleSelect\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } ] } } } Text (textResourceBindings) Altinn Studio Designer You can create a new text by clicking on the plus sign or select an existing one by clicking on the magnifying glass. See Adding and Editing Texts in an App for more information.\nCodeText can be added directly as a text string or by providing the key to a [text resource].(/altinn-studio/v8/reference/ux/texts/#add-and-change-texts-in-an-application).\nApp/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Checkboxes\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;help\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;shortName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tableTitle\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } Ledetekst (textResourceBindings.title): A heading with a question or instruction. Beskrivelse (textResourceBindings.description): Description. Text for further description or elaboration. Hjelpetekst (textResourceBindings.help): Help text. When help text is filled out, a question mark will appear next to the heading. Click on the question mark to display the text as a popup. Can be used for explanations, examples, use cases, etc. Kortnavn (textResourceBindings.shortName): Short name. Overrides the title of the component used in the default required validation message. Tittel i tabell (textResourceBindings.tableTitle): Table title. Overrides the title of the component used in column headers when the component is within repeating groups. Data Model To store and manipulate the data collected by the component, the component must be linked to a field in a data model. The option values are stored as strings.\nAltinn Studio Designer Select the field you want to link the component to from the dropdown menu. If there are no fields available, you must first upload a data model.\nCode App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MyDataModel.SomeField\u0026#34; } } Adding Options Options can be added manually or by using code lists.\nManually (options) Altinn Studio Designer Select \u0026ldquo;Manuelt\u0026rdquo; and click \u0026ldquo;Legg til flere\u0026rdquo; to add a new option. Choose or create a new text to add a label (label).\nThe option comes with a pre-filled value (value), which is the data that is stored when the user makes a selection. The value is stored as a string and can be changed as you wish.\nCode App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Alternativ 1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; } ] } Code List (optionsId) A code list is a predefined list of options.\nAltinn Studio Designer To add options from a code list, select \u0026ldquo;Kodeliste\u0026rdquo; and enter a code list ID. To use a custom (dynamic) code list, click \u0026ldquo;Bytt til egendefinert kodeliste\u0026rdquo; (switch to custom code list).\nIf you wish to secure dynamic code lists, you can check this option:\nCode App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;land\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;secure\u0026#34;: true } Source (source) One way to add options is by linking the component to a code list based on form data stored within the app itself. You can do this by adding a source (source); please refer to the documentation for instructions on how to configure this.\nAltinn Studio Designer Settings in Altinn Studio.\nCode App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.group[{0}].someField\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;helpText\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } ... Documentation for code lists\nLink a Component to a Code List Static Code Lists Dynamic Code Lists Code lists based on repeating groups from the data model Field is read-only (readOnly) Disables the component when checked (true).\nAltinn Studio Designer Code App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: true } Example read-only component\nRequired (required) Field is required when enabled (true) and a star is shown after the heading.\nAltinn Studio Designer Code App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: false } Preselected option (preselectedOptionsIndex) Sets a preselected value. Options are zero-indexed, so the first option is 0, the second is 1, and so on.\nAltinn Studio Designer Code App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;preselectedOptionsIndex\u0026#34;: 0 } Autocomplete (autocomplete) The HTML autocomplete attribute lets you specify what if any permission the user agent has to provide automated assistance in filling out form field values, as well as guidance to the browser as to the type of information expected in the field.\nAltinn Studio Designer Code App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;autocomplete\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;given-name\u0026#34; } Summary (renderAsSummary) Indicates whether the field should be included in a summary or not (default: false).\nAltinn Studio Designer Code{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;renderAsSummary\u0026#34;: false } Hidden (hidden) Indicates whether the field should be hidden or not (default: false).\nAltinn Studio Designer Code App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34;: false } Page Break (pageBreak) Indicates whether a page break should be added before or after the component. Can be either: auto (default), always, or avoid.\nAltinn Studio Designer Code App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;pageBreak\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;breakBefore\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;auto\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;breakAfter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;auto\u0026#34; } } Horizontal alignment with grid grid settings are not yet supported in the form editor but can be configured manually. The grid property controls horizontal alignment based on a 12-column layout. Items are allocated fractions of 12 which sets their width relative to the screen width. In the example below, we set the component\u0026rsquo;s width to 2/12 of the screen width for all screen sizes (from xs and up).\nCode App/ui/layouts/{page}.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;komponent-id\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 2, } } You can also use grid to place items side by side.\nSee Components placed side by side (grid) for details and examples.\n"

	"description": "When we talk about navigation, it can mean several things: giving users the ability to move from page to page in an app, providing an overview of pages/topics in the app with a navigation field at the top, or showing all tasks included in an app in a left menu. This article describes all three possibilities.",
	"content": "Moving from page to page with buttons Users move between pages in the app/form using navigation buttons. The buttons are added automatically when you use Altinn Studio, but you can also add them manually in code.\nAdding navigation buttons manually in the layout file (NavigationButtons) You add navigation buttons to all layout files where needed. If you want them to appear at the bottom of the page, you must place them at the bottom of the layout file.\nExample configuration:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nav-page2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationButtons\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;next\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;next\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;back\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;back\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;showBackButton\u0026#34;: true } Parameters for NavigationButtons Parameter Description id Unique ID for the component. type Must be \u0026ldquo;NavigationButtons\u0026rdquo;. textResourceBindings Allows you to override the default button texts with your own texts. showBackButton Optional. Shows Previous and Next buttons instead of just the Next button. Showing a side menu with the order of pages/tasks In code, you define the order of pages in Settings.json for the layout set:\nFile location: App/ui/*/Settings.json\n{ \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;side1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;side2\u0026#34;] } } Hide pages dynamically: You can hide certain pages with dynamic expressions.\nGrouping pages You can group pages and display them in a side menu as an alternative to traditional ordering. Then you replace pages.order with pages.groups:\nFile location: App/ui/*/Settings.json\n{ \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;groups\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;group.info\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;info\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;info1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;info2\u0026#34;] }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;group.form\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;markWhenCompleted\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;side1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;side2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;side3\u0026#34;] }, { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;oppsummering\u0026#34;] } ] } } Parameters for page groups Parameter Description name Text resource that specifies the name of the page group. Must be included if the group contains more than one page. type Optional. Use \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo;. markWhenCompleted Optional. Marks pages as completed when all validation errors are corrected and the user has seen the page. order Specifies which pages are included in the group. Showing process and tasks in the navigation menu Showing the process by defining it in code You can display the entire process in the navigation menu in two ways. In code, you do this:\nFor the entire app: in layout-sets.json with uiSettings.taskNavigation Per layout set: in Settings.json with pages.taskNavigation Example for the entire app:\nFile location: App/ui/layout-sets.json\n{ \u0026#34;uiSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;taskNavigation\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;task.form\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_2\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;receipt\u0026#34; } ] } } Parameters for process steps Parameter Description name Optional. Text resource that specifies the name of the task. taskId Which task it concerns. Mandatory if type is not set. type \u0026ldquo;receipt\u0026rdquo;. Mandatory if taskId is not set. Showing navigation from Altinn Studio In Studio, we have a dedicated navigation menu that you can add from the Designer page. You can choose whether to show all pages/tasks in the navigation, or just the ones you select.\nAdding tasks to navigation Open the app you want to add a navigation menu to. Click on Utforming in the top menu. You\u0026rsquo;ll go to the Oversikt page for Utforming, where you can see the tasks available in the app. Under Andre innstillinger, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a message at the top stating that you\u0026rsquo;re not showing any tasks in the navigation menu yet. Below that, you\u0026rsquo;ll find a table with tasks you can choose to display. Select Vis alle oppgavene if you want to include all tasks in the navigation menu. You\u0026rsquo;ll see that they become available in the top table. Select individual tasks with Vis oppgaven if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to include all tasks. The top table now shows the tasks you\u0026rsquo;ve chosen to display and the order they appear in. You can click on the three dots to the right of each task and choose whether to hide individual tasks or move them up and down to change the order of tasks in the navigation. Here you can also change the display name for a task and go directly to designing it. Use the Vis med navigasjonsmeny button to preview the navigation menu on the left side of the app. Showing a progress indicator A progress indicator is a small visual wheel that shows how far users have progressed in filling out or reading a form. It can be useful for giving users an overview of the total number of pages and where they are in the completion process. The progress indicator appears at the top right corner.\nImportant to know Tasks in the process count towards the total number of pages in the progress indicator. If you have set up track selection or dynamically hidden pages, the number of pages can vary greatly and seem confusing to the user.\nConsider whether it makes sense and provides value for the user to add a progress indicator before choosing to add it.\nAdding the progress indicator itself File location: App/ui/*/Settings.json\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;student-info\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;school-work\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;well-being\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;showProgress\u0026#34;: true } } Showing a navigation bar (NavigationBar) A navigation bar appears at the top of the page in an app/form and can make it easier for users to see all pages in the app. It\u0026rsquo;s important that you give each page good names for the navigation bar to be useful.\nNavigation field desktop How does it work? Large screens: All pages are shown in the list. If there isn\u0026rsquo;t room on one line, the list continues on the next line. Small screens: All pages are hidden in a dropdown menu. The active page is shown in the menu. Users can click on the menu to see all pages. Adding the navigation bar in code You add the navigation bar by inserting the code for it in all layout files where it should be used:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;navbar-page1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationBar\u0026#34; } Showing the dropdown menu on all screens In code, you can set up to show the pages in the navigation bar as a dropdown menu, even on larger screens:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;navbar-page1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationBar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;compact\u0026#34;: true } Changing the texts on buttons in the navigation bar The buttons in the navigation bar get their names from the page\u0026rsquo;s filename, without the file extension. For example, side1.json and side2.json become the buttons \u0026ldquo;side1\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;side2\u0026rdquo;.\nHow to change the texts:\nAdd texts in resources.XX.json, where id is the filename without the extension:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;side1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;First page\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;side2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Last page\u0026#34; } Specifying validation on page change You can add code to check for validation errors when the user tries to go to the next page. Validation errors can, for example, mean that the user has forgotten to fill in a field or has filled it in with information in the wrong format. If there are errors, navigation is stopped with one of the validation codes in the section below.\nApp frontend version 4 The NavigationButtons component has the properties validateOnNext and validateOnPrevious:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nav-buttons1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationButtons\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;validateOnNext\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;page\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;current\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;show\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;All\u0026#34;] } } page can be:\ncurrent - only this page all - all pages currentAndPrevious - this and previous pages show contains which validation types are checked:\nSchema Component Expression CustomBackend Required AllExceptRequired All Using NavigationBar with validation The NavigationBar component has corresponding properties, validateOnForward and validateOnBackward:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nav1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationBar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;validateOnForward\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;page\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;current\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;show\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;All\u0026#34;] } } App frontend version 3 In version 3, you add a trigger to the navigation button:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nav-buttons1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationButtons\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;next\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Next\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;validatePage\u0026#34;] } Available triggers Trigger Description validatePage Validates components on the current page. validateAllPages Validates all components on all pages.

The elements are saved to the organisation library repository and published to the service owner space in the Altinn Studio Designer organisation library.\nLibrary elements use sequential versioning in addition to a \u0026ldquo;latest\u0026rdquo; version. This is to support two use cases:\nPinning a version - to make sure that the application will not change when a new version is published. Using the latest version. By using the \u0026ldquo;latest\u0026rdquo; version, the application runtime will automatically fetch the updated element without the application having to be redeployed. When should you use a library element? If you want to reuse an element between multiple applications, then library elements is the preferred solution.\nIf you want to manage an element\u0026rsquo;s versioning independent of an application itself and prefer to publish a new version over redeploying the application, then using the organisation library with the \u0026ldquo;latest\u0026rdquo; version in the application might be something to consider.\nSee the subpages for elements which are currently supported in the Altinn Studio Designer organisation library.\nLibrary Code ListsWhat are library code lists?\n"

To configure the order of the layout pages, see Navigation. Example of a file structure with two process tasks, each with its own layout set:\n|- App/ |- ui/ | - layout-sets.json |- form-a/ |- Settings.json |- layouts/ |- page1.json |- page2.json |- page3.json |- form-b/ |- Settings.json |- layouts/ |- page1.json |- page2.json |- page3.json In the layout-sets.json file, you define which task in the process where each layout-set should be used.

Help text - Click for help pop-up. Show description - You can describe it. Personnumber input - Input field for NIN. Surname - Input field for surname. Fetch - Button which fetches data based on the inputs. Behavior Before a user interacts with the component, it simply displays the input fields.\nOn a successful fetch the component adds a description to the fields, indicating that the data displayed is fetched from the National Population Register. The button transforms from a fetch button to a remove button.\nThe component has built in validation for the input fields on blur and on fetch. The NIN-input field validates the format of the National identity number according to the official guidelines for NINs. The surname input field checks that a surname is provided. The error messages for the input validations are displayed on the PersonLookup component.\nGiven valid input, but a mismatch between NIN and surname, the component displays an error message after attempting to fetch. There is a limit on the amount of unique failed lookups before the user is temporarily blocked.\nWhen the number of allowed unique failed lookups is exceeded, the components reflects this.\nProperties The following is an autogenerated list of the properties available for PersonLookup based on the component\u0026rsquo;s JSON schema file (linked below).\nGet the full name by setting the dataModelBindings.person_lookup_name property, or pick specific name parts by using the other name properties.\nProperty Type Description id string The component ID.

Instantiation will fail if you attempt to prefill ER-data, but do not have an organization available.\nDSF here you enter fields from the data model that are to be prefilled with data from the National Population Register. The field that is prefilled with DSF-data will only have a value if you instantiate on behalf of a person. Instantiation will fail if you attempt to prefill DSF-data, but do not have a person available.\nUserProfile here you enter fields from the data model that are to be prefilled with data from the users profile in Altinn.

	"content": "🚧 This documentation is a work in progress. Usage Radio buttons are often used in forms to collect input from the user where they need to choose only one of several options from a list.\nAnatomy Title - Question or instruction. Current Selection - Indicates the selected option. Option - Enables this option and disables the current selection. Label - Text label associated with the radio button. Style Radio buttons should always have an associated label on the right side. Best Practices List options in a logical order: most likely to least likely to be selected simplest to most complex operation least to most risk Preselect one option. Choose the safest, most secure, and private option first. If safety and security are not important, choose the most likely or convenient option. If users should have the option to avoid making a selection, add a \u0026ldquo;None\u0026rdquo; (or equivalent) option. If you cannot have a list of all possible options, add an \u0026ldquo;Other\u0026rdquo; option. Avoid alphabetical sorting as it is language-dependent and not localizable. Avoid overlapping options. For example, Select age: 0-20, 20-40 — What do you choose if your age is 20? Include all relevant options. For example, Select age: Below 20, Above 20 — What do you choose if you are 20? Content guidelines Keep labels short and descriptive. Start all labels with a capital letter. Do not include punctuation after labels. Related For a more compact way to display multiple options with single selection, use Dropdown. If users can choose multiple options from a list, use Checkboxes.

If the FileTransfer has a single recipient, this will be published at the same time as downloadconfirmed. Depending on the Broker Service settings, this may lead to the file being purged automatically.\nEvent: no.altinn.broker.fileneverconfirmeddownloaded This event is triggered on the ExpiryTime of the FileTransfer in the case that one or more recipients have not confirmed the download of the file. This may indicate that either the recipient has been unaware of the FileTransfer or that they have downloaded but neglected to call the ConfirmDownload. This event is also sent to the Recipient(s) that have not confirmed the download.\nWe suggest using the data supplied in the get details to investigate the actions.\nEvent: no.altinn.broker.filedpurged This event is triggered by the file cleanup process at the time of either the Expiry of the file, or due to all recipients having Confirmed their download.\nAfter this point the file data is no longer available for download, although the metadata persists.\n"

Translating authorization rules to xacml-policy for access control. Note that there is a simplification of rights for Messages between the Altinn 2 and Altinn 3 versions. Automatic Migration of Service Configuration Altinn\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Flytt av Data\u0026rdquo; project will take responsibility for migrating all necessary configurations for the Correspondence services that have data to be migrated. The project will create this on behalf of Service Owners so that it can be used to manage access to historical Message data.\nThese \u0026ldquo;migration resources\u0026rdquo; get a resourceId of the form: \u0026lt;serviceownercode\u0026gt;-migratedcorrespondence-\u0026lt;altinn2-servicecode\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;altinn2-serviceeditioncode\u0026gt;. Some descriptive fields receive a postfix so they can be distinguished from the Altinn 2 version of the service. For now - migrated from Altinn 2 is used (subject to change). Data migration is performed independently of service setup so that data can be migrated before the service must be fully established.\nThe automatic migration will use the existing Altinn 2 roles specified in the old authorization rules, translated on a best-effort basis. These roles will eventually be phased out in favor of the new AccessLists functionality, and there will be a future project to migrate all policies to the new standard. However, this is outside the scope of the Move Data project.\nIn general it is not desirable for service owners to modify the created resources or to use them as new production Correspondence services in Altinn 3. They should remain largely unchanged until the migration process is finished and Altinn 2 is shut down. (One exception will be during the transition to AccessLists.)\nNB: There are some new metadata fields, such as service descriptions in different languages, that cannot be automatically filled out and should be completed by the Service Owner afterward.\nTechnical Implementation An internal component is being built in the Altinn 2 codebase that will run in the Altinn 2 infrastructure and perform the migration of service configuration for this purpose. This component will not be made available to external parties but will only be used by the Move Data project.\nMigration of Service Configuration for Re-establishing a Service A function in Altinn Studio to let Service Owners manually migrate a Message service configuration was considered, following the pattern for Migration of Linked Services.\nThis has unfortunately not been prioritized due to few reported services needing re-establishment and limited team capacity.\nService owners who need to re-establish an Altinn 2 Message service as an Altinn 3 Message service should instead follow the standard steps here.\nSome service owners have requested import of delegations from the old resource to the new; see the instructions for ordering this in the delegation migration documentation.\n"

For a guide see: Get started with Altinn guide (Norwegian language only).\nThis step is only necessary for new enterprises that have not yet established themselves as service owners on the Altinn platform. As an existing service owner, you can proceed directly with the next steps to start using Altinn Correspondence.\nVis/skjul innhold 2. Create a User in Altinn Studio To be able to create a resource (step 3), you need a user in Altinn Studio. Your user must be linked to your organization. (If you have an Altinn Studio user, you can skip this step.) Contact Altinn Servicedesk if you’re unsure who the administrator is or whether your organization is set up in Altinn Studio.\nSee Create a User in Altinn Studio for a detailed guide.\nVis/skjul innhold 3. Activate the Resource Management System To send messages via Altinn Melding, the message must be linked to a resource. Resources are registered through Altinn Studio and are used to define access rules and access lists, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions. You activate the resource management system by creating a specific repository and a resource group for your organization. (You can skip this step if you have activated the resource management system.)\nSee Resource Management for a detailed guide.\nVis/skjul innhold 4. Create a Resource Log in to Altinn Studio and navigate to the resource dashboard.\nNote: As part of Altinn\u0026rsquo;s migration of existing messages, new resources are being created in your (service owner) resource dashboard. These message resources are intended only for use for Altinn II messages and must not be used for new correspondences. They can be identified by the inclusion of \u0026ldquo;migratedcorrespondence\u0026rdquo; in the resource ID. See Transition Solution for more information.\nCreate a new correspondence resource (meldingsressurs). Follow the guide, and fill in the necessary information and details about the service.\nResource-ID must consist of the service owner code followed by a description of the service, for example: «digdir-dokumentbestilling». The Resource-ID cannot be changed later. Note that the same resource is used in both test and production environments, so make sure to choose a correct and well-considered name from the start. Service name is what the end user sees. Choose a clear and descriptive name so it is easy to understand what type of message this is, for example: \u0026ldquo;Post from the public sector via eFormidling\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Correspondence services for the Register of Company Accounts\u0026rdquo;. See Resource Registry for a detailed instruction. Set policy rules for the resource. Your policy must be configured in such a way that they permit the actions:\n\u0026ldquo;read\u0026rdquo; meant for recipients to open and read a message. \u0026ldquo;write\u0026rdquo; meant for senders to send a message. \u0026ldquo;subscribe\u0026rdquo; to register event subscriptions in Altinn Events. The roles in Altinn II will be replaced by access packages in Altinn 3. We recommend all our service owners use both roles and access packages until June 2026. It\u0026rsquo;s important to thoroughly assess which access package to assign to each resource. Here you will find information about access packages.\nOrdinary mail: The Altinn II role \u0026ldquo;Mail/Archive\u0026rdquo; this is now replaced by the access package \u0026ldquo;Ordinær post til virksomheten\u0026rdquo;. Confidential mail: If the resource is to be confidential, you have to: select the access package \u0026ldquo;Post til virksomheten med taushetsbelagt innhold\u0026rdquo;.\ninclude the flag \u0026ldquo;IsConfidential\u0026rdquo; set to: \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo;.\nRead about confidential mail here.\nImportant: As a service owner, you only need to configure \u0026ldquo;read\u0026rdquo; rules via access packages in the GUI. Vis/skjul innhold 5. Access to scopes To authenticate and ensure that you can perform operations via the Correspondence API, Altinn must grant you access to the necessary scopes. The scope requirements depend on your chosen authentication method:\nFor Direct Maskinporten Authentication (Method 1):\naltinn:serviceowner (required for service owner access) altinn:correspondence.write (required for sending messages) For Traditional Altinn Token Exchange (Method 2):\naltinn:correspondence.write (required for sending messages) To obtain access to scopes, you must submit a request to: servicedesk@altinn.no. The request must include the scopes you need. Note that you may require more than just altinn:correspondence.write for your integration. A complete list of scopes can be found here: Complete list of scopes\nVis/skjul innhold 6. Register your Maskinporten Client with the required scopes To authenticate the Correspondence API you must register your Maskinporten client(s) with the necessary scopes, depending on whether you need to send and/or receive messages.\nThe scopes are maintained by Altinn, they are required for you to be authorized for the correct API operations. Note that this is not the same as the access granted by service owners in step 2 for the specific Correspondence service resource.\nUse Samarbeidsportalen self-service for registration. Here\u0026rsquo;s a detailed guide.\nTest environments Production environment Note: The resource policy on your resource must have assigned the required scopes to the organisation that your Maskinporten client(s) is registered on.\nVis/skjul innhold 7. Authentication For service owners, authentication is now more flexible with two supported methods:\nMethod 1: Direct Maskinporten Authentication You can now authenticate directly using your Maskinporten client with the altinn:serviceowner and altinn:correspondence.write scopes.\nBenefits:\nNo Altinn Token Exchange Required: Use Maskinporten tokens directly without exchanging them for Altinn tokens Method 2: Traditional Altinn Token Exchange For service owners who prefer the traditional approach or have existing integrations, you can continue to:\nAuthenticate using your Maskinporten Client with the altinn:correspondence.write scope Acquire an Altinn Token from Altinn Authentication Use the Altinn token for API calls Note: Automatic Sender Authorization: The system automatically determines and uses your organization number from the resource configuration. You no longer need to specify the Sender field in your API requests (this field is now deprecated)\nVis/skjul innhold 8. Integrate with Correspondence API Since Altinn Correspondence is open source, you can access our code in our public GitHub repository and build a local docker instance to test against.\nWe also welcome contributions to the solution.\nSee the readme file on GitHub for an introduction to Altinn 3 Correspondence, and how to build and run it in your dev environment.\nThe Repo also contains a Bruno-collection with examples.\nSwagger for the correspondence API is hosted here.\nVis/skjul innhold 9. Test layout and formatting in Arbeidsflate and Altinn 2 inbox Before going live, verify that correspondences render as intended for recipients.\nSend a test correspondence to a test recipient using your preferred tool (Bruno, SDK, or your integration). Verify in Arbeidsflate: Log in with the test recipient in af.tt02.altinn.no. Check that the test correspondence content is formatted as intended. Verify in Altinn 2 inbox: Log in with the test recipient in info.tt02.altinn.no. Check that the test correspondence content is formatted as intended. Note: Supported formatting tags (Markdown and HTML) are documented here: Overview of allowed markdown and HTML tags\nVis/skjul innhold 10. Set up Event subscriptions In order to use events/webhooks for a Correspondence resource, you need to set up a subscription for the given resource.\nSee the developer guide for detailed instructions.\nContact: You can reach us on our Slack channel Digdir samarbeid: produkt-melding\nOr by sending a request to: servicedesk@altinn.no\n"

	"description": "Learn how dialogs in Dialogporten use service resources in Altinn Resource Registry",
	"content": "Introduction All dialogs must refer to a main service resource. A service resource describes a particular digital service, and contains metadata such as a name, a description, what public actor owns and - most importantly - the authorization policy governing the use of that service.\nService resources reside in Altinn Resource Administration, alongside other types of resources which utilize Altinn Authorization for access management and control. The authorization policies are expressed in XACML, which describes the access rules that governs all dialogs that refer to it. Dialogporten is integrated with Altinn Authorization, and will consult it for every request made to Dialogporten and enforce its decisions. The main service resource policy, along with the party associated with each dialog, is thus used to control what information a given user can retrieve from Dialogporten. Access managers within organizations use these service resources, or groups of related service resources, when handling who should have access to do what on behalf of an organization.\nFor example, an action named \u0026ldquo;Go to signing\u0026rdquo; might refer to an action called \u0026ldquo;sign\u0026rdquo; in the XACML policy for the main service resource. If the user does not posess this permission, the button may be grayed out and disabled.\nAdvanced usage XACML offers great flexibility in how coarse or fine-grained the access control should be, and dialogs can contain actions and transmissions that can be matched by different rules defined within the policy of the service resource. Transmissions and actions can even refer to different service resources, giving the service owner more options in how the various parts of a dialog should be governed. This is enabled through the use of authorization attributes\nNote however, that the attachments within a transmission and actions always refer to a endpoint hosted by the service provider. Thus, the authorization decisions made in Altinn Authorization for actions and transmissions are to be considered advisory. The endpoints themselves must also enforce the same authorization policies. This can be done either by requesting Altinn Authorization (in the same manner as Dialogporten), or utilize dialog tokens which embeds the same authorization decision.\nRead more\nLearn about parties and how they are related to dialogs Reference information about the dialog aggregate root Reference information about the actions entities Reference information about the transmission entity "

	"description": "Setup and configuration of app and infrastructure for end-user system integration in an app.",
	"content": "End-user systems (SBS) are systems developed by vendors to simplify submissions to Altinn for their customers. This guide covers concepts and models relevant for integration between an Altinn Studio app and end-user systems. When integrating an end-user system with an Altinn Studio app, machine-to-machine communication is used between the vendor\u0026rsquo;s system and the app. There are mainly two ways to create this integration:\nID-porten client with token exchange The vendor of the end-user system creates an ID-porten client and adds the scopes required by the app (e.g., altinn:instances.read and altinn:instances.write) When integrating with Altinn apps, the end-user system exchanges the token for an Altinn token From the apps perspective, this is a normal flow (there are authenticated end-users) Suitable for systems where contact with the end-user is important, there is a low degree of automation, and the integration flow is fully user-driven. System user Vendor creates Maskinporten client Vendor creates a system in the system registry of Altinn Authorization (in the system definition, you specify the need for access to resources, e.g., an app) Customer registers a system user. The rights are then delegated. Vendor authenticates with Maskinporten client When integrating with Altinn apps, the system authenticates with Maskinporten and uses this token when submitting to Altinn For more information, see Altinn Authorization user guide for system users Suitable for systems with a higher degree of automation (and less need for contact/connection to the end-user), and for submissions on behalf of organizations. Integration using ID-porten When integrating from an end-user system based on an ID-porten client, there is always direct contact with the end-user. When the end-user logs in to the end-user system via ID-porten, the user must consent to the system performing altinn:instances.read and altinn:instances.write on their behalf (provided these scopes are registered in the ID-porten client). The token must then be exchanged in Altinn Authorization. This Altinn token can then be used to submit forms in an Altinn app on behalf of the user.\nThe scopes altinn:instances.read and altinn:instances.write are not service owner- or app-specific. When granting consent, the user allows the system to submit to all Altinn apps where the user is authorized (via XACML and other configuration). Better scope validation Given that altinn:instances.read and altinn:instances.write grant access to all apps in Altinn (where the user has access), there is often a need for a higher degree of isolation so that a more specific scope is required, tailored for a particular app. There is currently no built-in support for this, but it is possible to achieve by developing custom middleware in the app.\nThe service owner must create an app-specific scope in ID-porten via the collaboration portal and delegate this to organizations that intend to build end-user systems for the service owner\u0026rsquo;s app. The end-user system must then add this scope to its ID-porten client in addition to altinn:instances.read and altinn:instances.write (these are still required by the Altinn platform).\nIn the future, we want an app to be configurable with a custom scope that replaces altinn:instances.read and altinn:instances.write, which will also apply to platform services in Altinn (e.g., Storage), but it has not yet been decided how or when this will be implemented. Validation with ASP.NET Core middleware IAuthenticationContext.Current uses information about the logged-in user from the ASP.NET Core authentication stack. This means that the ASP.NET Core auth middleware must have run for you to get the correct information. Middleware for auth is added in UseAltinnAppCommonConfiguration. So if you want to access IAuthenticationContext.Current in a middleware, it must be added after UseAltinnAppCommonConfiguration has been called. The service owner can then create middleware or similar that performs additional authorization based on the authenticated user. Example:\nWebApplication app = builder.Build(); ... app.Use( async (context, next) =\u0026gt; { var authenticationContext = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService\u0026lt;IAuthenticationContext\u0026gt;(); var authenticated = authenticationContext.Current; if (authenticated is Authenticated.User user) { // Here we are expressing that for any API request for the authenticated party is a user, the user either has to // * Be logged in through Altinn portal // * Have consented to the custom app scope `myappscope` (it has consent required registered on the scope in ID-porten) if (!user.InAltinnPortal \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !user.Scopes.HasScope(\u0026#34;myappscope\u0026#34;)) { context.Response.StatusCode = 403; await context.Response.WriteAsync(\u0026#34;Forbidden\u0026#34;); return; } } await next(context); } ); Validation with XACML policy Scopes from the token can also be used as attributes in XACML.\nThe matcher urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:function:string-is-in is not necessarily completely safe. The scope annentest:app.a will also match here, since test:app.a is a substring of this.

The system user concept consists of the following components:\nMaskinporten – the authentication mechanism for everything related to system users: Registration of a system in the system registry (API at Altinn Authorization) Registering a system user (API at Altinn Authorization) Submission from the system (the vendors system/end-user system) System Registry A component in Altinn Authorization where all system definitions belonging to end-user systems are stored System The definition for the end-user system. This definition includes, among other things, which rights the system needs from the system user, and which Maskinporten client (client ID) the system intends to use when authenticating with Maskinporten. The system is registered and owned by the end-user system vendor in the system registry System User A virtual user owned by the customer of the vendor/end-user system When the system user is registered, the rights requested by the system must be delegated to the system user. In practice, the person who creates the system user (at the customer) must have these rights that the system requests This concept allows the system to impersonate the system user in the integration with an Altinn app. Thus, the system can make calls to Altinn\u0026rsquo;s APIs without an end-user from the organization being present. This is not possible with an ID-porten integration, as you are always dependent on a valid token from the end-user working at the customer (with sufficient permissions).\nExample Let\u0026rsquo;s walk through a concrete example for SBS based on system user integration.\nThis is a fictional example, but we use a well-known system, service owner, and form to make the example more relatable. Note that there are few steps for the service owner to perform here, but it is still important that the service owner is familiar with the process. System: Fiken AS (913312465) Service owner: Brønnøysundregisteret (brg) App: aarsregnskap Customer: Sindig Oriental Tiger AS (313725138) Environment: tt02 In this example, Fiken will automatically submit the annual accounts at the end of the year based on the accounts registered in their systems by the customer. This submission happens fully automatically, but the end-user at the customer must still log in and sign the annual accounts after it has been filled in in årsregnskap. We will now set up this integration from scratch.\nMore documentation about the system user flow for SBS can be found here. This guide is intended as an Altinn Studio app-specific example of the same concept.\nPrerequisites Brønnøysundregisteret needs access to Altinn Studio and the tt02 environment Fiken needs an agreement with Maskinporten for the environment (access to the Collaboration Portal for test) Fiken needs access to the following Maskinporten/ID-porten scopes: altinn:authentication/systemregister.write, altinn:authentication/systemuser.request.read, altinn:authentication/systemuser.request.write altinn:instances.read, altinn:instances.write 1. Service owner creates app A developer at Brønnøysundregisteret creates an app in Altinn Studio and names it aarsregnskap. To support system user-based integration with SBS, no special support is required in the app, so it is developed as usual, including an XACML policy that allows DAGL to fill in the form and sign.\n2. Fiken creates a Maskinporten client A Maskinporten client is required to use the system registry and to utilize the system user integration with aarsregnskap.\nGo to Collaboration Portal for test -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Administrasjon av tjenester\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Integrasjoner\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Ny integrasjon\u0026rdquo; Fill out the form and create the client with the following scopes: altinn:authentication/systemregister.write – to register the system in the system registry altinn:authentication/systemuser.request.read, altinn:authentication/systemuser.request.write – to request a system user for the system altinn:instances.read, altinn:instances.write – to submit on behalf of the system user Note down the client ID (for example, a2ed712d-4144-4471-839f-80ae4a68146b) Generate and register JWKS for the client (keep both the private and public JWK) See documentation for registering a Maskinporten client here.\n3. Fiken registers system in the system registry With the access token from Maskinporten for the newly created client, Fiken can register itself as a system in the Altinn Authorization system registry. To obtain a token that can be used for system registration, Fiken must include a scope that grants access to the system registry:\nPOST https://test.maskinporten.no/token { \u0026#34;aud\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://test.maskinporten.no/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sub\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2829136a-1dd4-4a13-8150-d605a3fc39e6\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;altinn:authentication/systemuser.request.read altinn:authentication/systemuser.request.write altinn:authentication/systemregister.write\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;iss\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2829136a-1dd4-4a13-8150-d605a3fc39e6\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;exp\u0026#34;: 1718124835, \u0026#34;iat\u0026#34;: 1718124715, \u0026#34;jti\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;89365ecd-772b-4462-a4de-ac36af8ef3e2\u0026#34; } HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json { \u0026#34;access_token\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;access_token\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, ... } This token can be used directly with the system registry API.

The customer approves the system user request A person at the customer, e.g., the general manager, approves the system user request by following the confirmUrl from the response above. If testing is done in tt02, you can, for example, find the DAGL (general manager) for the organization of the system user. In this case, the customer, with national identity number 14830199986, has the DAGL role (general manager), so this can be used when logging in with TestID.

The service owner can use information about the authenticated party if needed As exemplified above, you can use IAuthenticationContext to implement custom logic based on whether a system user is authenticated in the request:\nIAuthenticationContext.Current uses information about the logged-in user from the ASP.NET Core authentication stack. This means that the ASP.NET Core auth middleware must have run for you to get the correct information. Middleware for auth is added in UseAltinnAppCommonConfiguration. So if you want to access IAuthenticationContext.Current in a middleware, it must be added after UseAltinnAppCommonConfiguration has been called. WebApplication app = builder.Build(); ... app.Use( async (context, next) =\u0026gt; { var authenticationContext = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService\u0026lt;IAuthenticationContext\u0026gt;(); var authenticated = authenticationContext.Current; if (authenticated is Authenticated.SystemUser systemUser) { ... } await next(context); } ); "

	"description": "What is signing in an Altinn 3 service?",
	"content": "Authenticated Electronic Signature An electronic signature is linked to traceability. Traceability means being able to demonstrate that an action was performed at a specific time and tied to a specific identity. The requirements for traceability describe the extent to which it should be possible to verify afterward that an actor was responsible for a piece of information or performed an action at a specific time.\nAn authenticated electronic signature allows service owners to ensure traceability by verifying that an identified person performed a signing action at a specific time, e.g., when the end user confirms the accuracy of information by signing. The signing solution in Altinn 3 is an authenticated signature with the option of security level 3 or 4. The authentication level is configurable for each service. It is also possible to choose lower authentication levels than 3 and 4. If advanced signatures are desired, third-party products such as eSignering | Samarbeidsportalen (digdir.no) must be used.\nService owners must make their own assessment of which electronic signature they want and need for their services, based on the requirements for signature and traceability in the regulations for which each service owner is responsible.\nTechnical guides for configuring signing can be found here.\nFunctionality What is being signed? The service owner controls the selection of data elements that are to be signed and selects which authentication level (identification level) the end user must log in with before signing (level 1-4). One or more signing steps in sequence are possible.\nSignature The signing action is logged, and a signature object is created. The signature object represents a signature performed by a person and contains information about which data elements are signed and which are not. The signature object contains a so-called hash code of the data associated with the data elements that are signed. Hashing is a one-way mathematical algorithm that calculates a unique code based on the data. If even one character in the data is changed, the hash code will no longer match. This ensures that the data no longer aligns with what was signed, making any changes to the data detectable.\nLogging An event log is kept, recording actions performed in the application. Signing is a type of action that is explicitly logged. The ID of the person who performed the signing action is logged, along with the security level of the login, the time of the action, which step in the process the action was performed on, and that it was a signing action. Log data related to electronic signatures in Altinn 3 is stored separately from services in a central event log database.\nProcessing of personal data To ensure traceability, personal data is processed for logging purposes. The ID of the person who performed the signing action is logged, which can be linked to a national ID number, the security level of the login, the step in the process at which the action was performed, the time of the action, and that it was a signing action. Digdir is the data controller for the processing of this personal data for this purpose.\nThe service owner is the data controller for the processing of personal data in their services and forms, including the relevant signature object and associated data. This includes the ID of the person who performed the signing action and the national ID number. According to the collaboration agreement, Digdir is the data processor for the service owner.\nStorage time After the process in Altinn 3 is completed, the service owner can download all data, including the signature object. The end user receives a receipt (PDF).\nYou may configure the persistence lifetime of the instance and its data by configuring Persistence. If not configured, the following applies:\nThe service owner acknowledges that the signature object and associated data have been downloaded. The end user can choose to keep or delete their receipt for the signing from their inbox. If the end user chooses to delete their receipt after the service owner has downloaded the signature object, this means that Digdir deletes the signature object from our systems. Therefore, if you wish to archive the signature, the signature object and associated data must be stored in the service owner\u0026rsquo;s systems.\nDigdir logs that the signing action was performed. This means that even if the signature object is deleted, Digdir still retains the log showing that a signing action was completed. Regular application logs (typically used for troubleshooting) are stored by Digdir for 90 days, while event logs are stored for 13 months.\nVerification of signature The service owner stores the signature object in their archival system. The signature object contains a hash code of the data associated with the data element. If the signature object is later altered, this can be verified by the fact that the hash code in the signature object no longer matches. This contributes to the traceability of the signature object. This assumes that the signature, i.e., the hash code, also exists on the end user\u0026rsquo;s receipt so that both parties have their own copy.\nHere you can read the technical description of how signature verification is done.\n"

	"content": "The points below cover a minimum of what is required to create and publish a form on Altinn Studio.\nVis/skjul innhold Creating the service containing the form New services are created from your service dashboard.\nClick on the \u0026ldquo;Create new application\u0026rdquo; button at the top right of the screen. Choose the owner of the service from the dropdown list. If you choose your own user, you will be able to test all functionality in Altinn Studio but will not have access to the test environment. If you choose an organization for which you have rights, you will also have the opportunity to publish the service to the organization\u0026rsquo;s test environment. Enter the name of the service. The name can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. This name is used to identify the service and cannot be changed once set. Display name can be set and changed after the service is created. Click the \u0026ldquo;Create application\u0026rdquo; button. Once the service is created, you will be taken to the service overview page.\nYour browser does not support video playback.\nVis/skjul innhold Adding a display name for the service The service needs a display name that appears as a heading on the form and in the user\u0026rsquo;s inbox in Altinn.\nAdd a display name by:\nClicking on the \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; button in the top left menu bar. Modifying the \u0026ldquo;Application name\u0026rdquo; field to the desired display name. The change is saved as soon as you leave the field. Once the display name is changed, you can see that it has also been updated on the overview page.\nYour browser does not support video playback.\nVis/skjul innhold Creating a data model for the form The data model defines the data expected to be collected and the format it should be in.\nOne can think of a data model as a table of contents for the form.\nFor a simple form, there is often a 1-1 correspondence from fields in the data model to fields in the form, while for more advanced forms, the data model and form may be quite different.\nA very simple data model with some example fields is included when creating a service. You can edit the field names to make it clear what they represent and add your own fields.\nThe data model is used to determine what data should be collected. It is also used to determine how the data should look/be, by setting constraints that are validated.\nNavigate to the \u0026ldquo;Data Model\u0026rdquo; page by clicking on \u0026ldquo;Data Model\u0026rdquo; in the top menu bar. Click on a field to bring up editing options, e.g., to change the name of the field. Click \u0026ldquo;Add new\u0026rdquo; and choose type. Relevant types for simple forms include, among others: Text - text content, can be used for most fields. Integer Decimal When you have finished adding fields, click the \u0026ldquo;Generate models\u0026rdquo; button. If you want to group fields, you can add an \u0026ldquo;Object\u0026rdquo; and then add fields under that group.\nYour browser does not support video playback.\nVis/skjul innhold Dragging form components into the form and configuring them Forms are created in Altinn Studio by navigating to the \u0026ldquo;Build\u0026rdquo; page. On this page\nForms are created by dragging desired form components into each individual form page.\nAdding fields to the form The components that can be used in the form are divided into 3 categories:\nStandard: Contains all simple form components such as text fields (long and short), dropdown list (single or multiple answers), checkboxes, radio buttons, submission button, and similar. Text: Contains text components used to inform the user. E.g., heading, paragraph, warning, information panel. Advanced: Contains more advanced components such as group, repeating group, map, list, and similar. Click on the page you want to edit. When creating a service, a page named \u0026ldquo;Page1\u0026rdquo; is automatically included. Select a component from the panel on the left and drag it onto the page. The component is now active in the configuration panel and can be configured. If the component in the form is to be used to collect data, it must be linked to the corresponding field in the data model. Open the section in the configuration column called \u0026ldquo;Data Model Bindings\u0026rdquo; Click on the available binding (e.g., \u0026ldquo;short answer\u0026rdquo;) and select the desired field in the data model from the list. The list is searchable. Close the setup by clicking the X icon, or remove the binding by clicking the trash can icon. Add texts for the component by opening the \u0026ldquo;Text\u0026rdquo; section in the configuration column. Heading text is required for all components intended to collect data. Click on \u0026ldquo;Heading text\u0026rdquo; to add. Description is optional and appears below the heading text. Click on \u0026ldquo;Description\u0026rdquo; to add. Help text is optional and appears in a ? icon next to the heading text. Click on \u0026ldquo;Help text\u0026rdquo; to add. Click the X icon to close the text editing view. To edit existing texts, click on the relevant text to open the editing view. Open the \u0026ldquo;Content\u0026rdquo; section in the configuration column to set up other configurations. Available configurations vary from component to component, but common to most are: Whether the width of the component on the screen should be adjusted Whether the component should be read-only Your browser does not support video playback.\nUseful Information The button to submit the form must be added manually. Use the component called \u0026ldquo;Button\u0026rdquo;. Add a new page by clicking on the \u0026ldquo;Add new page\u0026rdquo; button at the bottom of the page column. Edit page names by selecting the page, then click on the ID field to edit. Add a display name for the page by opening the text section and adding \u0026ldquo;Display name for page\u0026rdquo;. Buttons to navigate forward/backward between pages are added automatically when adding a page. Vis/skjul innhold Configuring access rules We are working to simplify this setup, as there are many rules to deal with in the service template. We recommend following the recipe below for now. Descriptions in this section will be updated continuously as we make changes. When creating a new service, it comes with a set of access rules. These control who should have access to the various parts of the service. The setup that comes with the service is a setup that will work for the vast majority of simple services. However, it is still important to consider what roles an end user must have to be able to use the service.\nThe current template allows all users with the Altinn roles:\nManaging director (DAGL) - this is a role one can have for a business. Private individual (PRIV) - this is a role everyone has for themselves. to use the service. This applies to the entire service. In addition, it allows the service owner to start up, retrieve data from and write data to the service, and confirm that data has been received in their own systems.\nTo only test a simple form in the test environment, no changes need to be made here. However, we still recommend making a conscious choice here before the service is eventually put into production, and possibly removing the role that is not applicable to your service. For example, if the service is intended for use by private individuals, the \u0026ldquo;Director\u0026rdquo; role can be removed. If the service is to be submitted on behalf of a company, the \u0026ldquo;Private individual\u0026rdquo; role can be removed.\nIf other roles are also relevant, these can also be added. A full overview of available roles in Altinn can be found here.\nThe set of access rules comes with 2 rules:\nThe first rule covers end users, and what access you want to give to end users with specific roles. The second rule covers the service owner, and what access you want to give to the service owner. It will mostly be the rule covering end users that it will be relevant to change here.\nFor example, to remove the \u0026ldquo;Managing director (DAGL)\u0026rdquo; role:\nClick on the \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; button in the top menu bar on the service workspace page. Choose the \u0026ldquo;Access rules\u0026rdquo; tab from the left menu in \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo;. Scroll down to the content of \u0026ldquo;Rule 1\u0026rdquo; Find the field \u0026ldquo;Who should have these rights?\u0026rdquo; In the field \u0026ldquo;Who should have these rights?\u0026rdquo;, uncheck \u0026ldquo;Managing director\u0026rdquo;(/\u0026ldquo;Daglig leder\u0026rdquo;) to remove it. Optionally, add other roles from the dropdown list if needed. The change is automatically saved when it is made. The \u0026ldquo;Settings\u0026rdquo; window can be closed. Your browser does not support video playback.\nVis/skjul innhold Saving changes When working in the workspace of the service, you are working with a copy of the service for your user. All changes you make are automatically saved along the way to your file area in Altinn Studio, but to make the changes available to others and publish them, you need to upload the changes to the service\u0026rsquo;s central file area.\nThis is done by clicking on \u0026ldquo;Upload your changes\u0026rdquo; to the right in the top menu bar.\nClick on \u0026ldquo;Upload your changes\u0026rdquo;. Write a brief description of the changes. Click \u0026ldquo;Validate changes\u0026rdquo;. The changes are now compared with what is on the central file area of the service, and then uploaded.\nYour browser does not support video playback.\nIf changes have been made directly in the files, or outside of Altinn Studio, these can be brought into your file area by clicking \u0026ldquo;Fetch changes\u0026rdquo; to the right in the menu bar.\nNote! If changes are made both in Altinn Studio and directly in the files of the service, conflicts may occur, as the tool does not know which of the changes is applicable.\nIt is therefore very wise to upload changes from Altinn Studio frequently, and if changes are made in the files directly, you should always click \"Fetch changes\" before continuing to work on the service in Altinn Studio to avoid conflicts. Deleting \u0026ldquo;local\u0026rdquo; changes If a conflict arises, or if changes have been made that you want to discard, you can delete all changes that have been made in your file area. The service will then be reset to how it is on the service\u0026rsquo;s central file area.\nClick on the menu button marked with 3 dots all the way to the right on the menu bar. Choose \u0026ldquo;Local changes\u0026rdquo;. If you have any changes you want to keep, they can be downloaded here, either by downloading all files for the entire service, or by downloading only the files that have been changed. To delete all changes in your file area, select \u0026ldquo;Delete local changes\u0026rdquo;. In the dialog that opens, you must enter the name of the service to confirm the deletion. Enter the name and click \u0026ldquo;Delete my changes\u0026rdquo; to delete, or \u0026ldquo;Cancel\u0026rdquo; to cancel. Your browser does not support video playback.\nVis/skjul innhold Publishing the service This section is only relevant if you have created a service for an organization. If you have created a test service for yourself, you do not have access to any test environment, and the \u0026ldquo;Publish\u0026rdquo; button will not appear. Publishing the service to the test and production environments is done via the \u0026ldquo;Publish\u0026rdquo; page. You can access this by clicking the \u0026ldquo;Publish\u0026rdquo; button at the top right.\nOn the publishing page, you get an overview of all available environments, as well as the status of the service in each individual environment.\nPublishing takes place in 2 steps:\nBuild version: Here, all files and settings associated with the service are collected into a package that is given a version. Publish version: Here, you retrieve the desired version from the packages you have built and publish it to the environment. Building a version In the right column, enter the desired version name/number. Version names must start with a number or letter, and can contain:\nnumbers lowercase letters period . and hyphen - You can also provide a description of the version.\nClick \u0026ldquo;Build version\u0026rdquo; to start the build, and wait for it to complete. This may take some time.\nYour browser does not support video playback.\nPublishing a version Once a version is built, it can be published to the desired environment. This is done by selecting the desired version from the dropdown list associated with that environment. Then click \u0026ldquo;Publish new version\u0026rdquo; and confirm that you want to publish the service to the environment.\nThe publication is then started, which may take some time. The status will be updated as soon as the service is available in the environment.\nYour browser does not support video playback.\n"

	"description": "Get started making a new component available to the forms builder in Altinn Studio",
	"content": "This guide will explain how to add a new component to the Altinn Studio forms builder.\nPre-requisites: The new component must be implemented in app-frontend. Studio must be set up to run locally to test your changes. Add the component to the toolbar All components that can be added to a form from Altinn Studio are shown in the toolbar on the left-hand side of the window:\nForms builder To add your component to the toolbar, do the following steps:\nNavigate to the forms-builder code, which is located in frontend/packages/ux-editor. Open the file src/components/index.ts Add your new component to the ComponentTypes enum - make sure you use the same naming as you have used for the type property of your component in the layout files. Update ComponenTypes enum Set an icon for your component in the toolbar in the componentIconsobject. Available icons can be found here, use naming fa fa-\u0026lt;icon name\u0026gt;. Add a new object describing your new component. The object must have type IComponent, and can contain the following properties: Property Description name Component name, use the ComponentTypes enum as value Icon Component icon, use the componentIcons property you created customProperties Object containing any custom properties that the component should be initialized with (default values) Add your newly created component definition to the relevant list: schemaComponents for basic form components textComponents for components that are primarily displaying texts advancedComponents for more complex components. When you now open Altinn Studio locally and navigate to the forms builder, you should see your new component in the toolbar, and should be able to drag it into the form.\nSet up options to edit component All components will display the id field available for editing when trying to edit a component. To set up editing of other properties for the component, follow the instructions below.\nNavigate to src/components/config/componentConfig.ts. Find the componentSpecificEditConfig object, add your new ComponentType enum value as key, and add a new list of settings that can be edited. Current properties that are supported for editing directly are:\ndataModelBindings size (Header component) title (textResourceBindings.title) description (textResourceBindings.description) readOnly required options optionsId (codeList) preselectedIndex If you need to edit any other properties for a component, consider if it is something that is relevant for only your component, or if it could be reused. If it can be used by other components, feel free to add it to the list of configComponents by implementing it, see the existing components as examples.\nMany components have the same set of properties that should be edited: dataModelBindings, title, description, readOnly, required. we have collected these into a reusable list called editBoilerplate which can be used instead of typing all the property names when relevant. Set up config for components If you have custom needs for editing your component, you can do the following: Add a new folder under src/components/config/componentSpecificContent with the name of your component. In this folder, implement the view that can be used to edit your component. See existing componentSpecificContent for examples. Create an index.ts file form the component folder and export your newly implemented edit component view from there. Open src/components/config/componentSpecificContent/ComponentSpecificContent.tsx Add a new case to the switch/case statement with your component. Import the custom view you just created and render it here, inside a \u0026lt;FieldSet\u0026gt; component. Note that it is possible to combine this custom approach with the standard approach described above. If you have any of the standard properties to edit, use the config setup, and create a custom view for anything that is not covered by that. When you add your component to the form now, and open the editing view, you should see all the properties that you have added (standard and custom) available to edit.\n"

	"description": "How to set up event subscription in an app",
	"content": "Subscribing to events In order to receive events in the application you need create a subscription. While you can create a subscription authenticated as a user, most scenarios will probably be to authenticate as the organization owning the application, and to create the subscription as part of the startup process of the application. This example covers authenticating as an organization through Maskinporten.\nYou should first make sure you have a client definition registered in Maskinporten for your application. See Authenticating with Maskinporten on how register a client.\nCurrently the localtest environment does not support generating inbound events for an app. In order to do this you need use tools like Postman or REST Client in VS Code to send a request to the application\u0026rsquo;s event endpoint.\nConfiguring Maskinporten integration The application uses the built-in IMaskinportenClient to authenticate with Maskinporten and automatically exchange the token to an Altinn token for communicating with Altinn Events.\nYou need to configure the Maskinporten settings in your appsettings.json:\n\u0026#34;MaskinportenSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Authority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://test.maskinporten.no/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ClientId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your-client-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;JwkBase64\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;base64-encoded-jwk\u0026#34; } If you need to use a different configuration path than the default MaskinportenSettings, you can configure it in Program.cs:\nservices.ConfigureMaskinportenClient( \u0026#34;YourCustomMaskinportenSettingsPath\u0026#34; ); The built-in Maskinporten client will automatically handle token acquisition and exchange for Altinn APIs, including the Events service.\nYou also need to configure the HTTP client for the Events API in your RegisterCustomAppServices method:\nvoid RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // Configure HTTP client for Events API with Maskinporten authorization services.AddHttpClient\u0026lt;IEventsSubscription, EventsSubscriptionClient\u0026gt;() .UseMaskinportenAltinnAuthorization(\u0026#34;altinn:serviceowner/instances.read\u0026#34;); } Protecting the event endpoint with a secret Receiving events in the application is based on exposing a webhook endpoint to which the Event Service posts the event. Upon receiving an event, the application validates if a secret is provided before accepting the event. The secret is provided by implementing the IEventSecretCodeProvider interface. By default there is an example implementation in place using a key from the key vault using a key with the name EventSubscription--SecretCode in the key vault the value of that key is used. You should hover not use the same key/value for multiple applications so it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to create your own implementation.\nWhen developing locally you should set the secret as a dotnet user-secret by running the following command in the root folder of the application:\ndotnet user-secrets set \u0026#34;EventSubscription--SecretCode\u0026#34; \u0026#34;your-secret-code\u0026#34; Note that the return url and the secret code is part of the subscription definition. This means that if you rotate the key, you should remove the existing subscription first, or else you will have two active subscriptions for the same events. Create subscription Once you have your client registered with Maskinporten, your config setup, your ClientDefinition in place and your webhook secret defined - you are ready to add the code required to make a subscription.\nThe example below is using the IHostedService from Microsoft which, in this case, run once after the services are registered in the container, but before the application is configured.\nusing Altinn.App.Core.Infrastructure.Clients.Events; using Altinn.App.Core.Internal.Events; using Altinn.App.Core.Models; using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting; using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; namespace Altinn.App.Core.EFormidling { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Hosted service to set up prequisites for Eformidling integration. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public class EformidlingStartup : IHostedService { private readonly AppIdentifier _appIdentifier; private readonly IEventsSubscription _eventsSubscriptionClient; private readonly ILogger\u0026lt;EformidlingStartup\u0026gt; _logger; /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Initializes a new instance of the \u0026lt;see cref=\u0026#34;EformidlingStartup\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; class. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public EformidlingStartup(AppIdentifier appId, IEventsSubscription eventsSubscriptionClient, ILogger\u0026lt;EformidlingStartup\u0026gt; logger) { _appIdentifier = appId; _eventsSubscriptionClient = eventsSubscriptionClient; _logger = logger; } ///\u0026lt;inheritDoc/\u0026gt; public async Task StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) { var eventType = \u0026#34;app.eformidling.reminder.checkinstancestatus\u0026#34;; try { Subscription subscription = await _eventsSubscriptionClient.AddSubscription(_appIdentifier.Org, _appIdentifier.App, eventType); _logger.LogInformation(\u0026#34;Successfully subscribed to event {eventType} for app {appIdentifier}. Subscription {subscriptionId} is being used.\u0026#34;, eventType, _appIdentifier, subscription.Id); } catch (Exception ex) { _logger.LogError(\u0026#34;Unable to subscribe to event {eventType} for app {appIdentifier}.

If you don\u0026rsquo;t want this behaviour you should catch any exception and not rethrow it. "

	"content": "The Norwegian Digitalisation Agency (Digdir) has chosen to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) in connection with the selection of a cloud service provider for the operation of Altinn 3. Altinn is in a transitional phase from the existing solution (Altinn II) to a new version that is developed and operated in the cloud, and is based on open source (Altinn 3).\nIn chapter 1, we write more about Altinn and the cloud journey we have embarked on. Then, in chapter 2, we provide a systematic description of the processing of personal data in Altinn, and what the purpose and legal basis for this are. Altinn acts mostly in the role of data processor on behalf of the many public entities that use the solution for development and operation of their digital services. Therefore, it is also important to specify that these public entities – which we refer to as service owners in Altinn – must make their own assessments for their specific services, in their role as data controllers.\nIn chapter 3, we address certain legal issues that are particularly relevant for the use of cloud services. We make it clear that we do not plan to transfer personal data out of Norway / EU / EEA and we discuss our assessments regarding the choice of data processor.\nWe address the rights and freedoms of the registered (users) in chapter 4, and assess the necessity and proportionality of the processing that takes place in Altinn – against the risks, benefits, and effects of digitalization and the use of cloud services.\nIn chapter 5, we go into detail about the information security in Altinn, risks, and what measures we take in Altinn to reduce the risks. There are also significant advantages for the registered\u0026rsquo;s privacy associated with the use of cloud services, including that, in our assessment, one will receive the best protection of information security against major known threat actors.\nOur assessments lead us to the conclusion that the choices and measures we have implemented in Altinn mean that we believe the registered overall receive the best privacy by using our digital services, as we use a professional, serious, and internationally recognized cloud service provider that relies on trust in the market. And this trust also means that privacy in Norway and Europe will be respected.\nDigdir will continue to make ongoing assessments of risk, information security, and data protection impacts for Altinn. We will stay updated on the threat landscape and the emergence of new technology, and will continue to work for responsible and safe digitization of Norway, in accordance with directives from the Storting and the Government.\nThis version is updated as a result of the adequacy decision dated July 10, 2023, which applies to the transfer of personal data between the EU/EEA and the USA. Some editorial changes have also been made.\n"

Note that the example is not identical to the actual code but has been adapted to create prototypes in Figma. Configuration Component Summary The most basic way to use the component is to show a summary of a single component.\nFor example, if you want to show a summary of a simple input field configured like this:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MyInputFieldID\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, } your Summary2 configuration would look like this:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MySummary2ID\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MyInputFieldID\u0026#34; } } The resulting Summary2 output would look like this:\nExample of Summary2 components inside groups Page Summary If you would like to show a summary of an entire page, you would set the target.type property to \u0026quot;page\u0026quot; like so:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MySummary2ID\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;page\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MyLayoutFilename\u0026#34; } } In this case, the target.id is set to the name of the layout page you want to render, so you would have a file called MyLayoutFilename.json in your project.\nLayoutset Summary It is also possible to render a summary of an entire layoutSet. In this case, you would set the target.type property to \u0026quot;layoutSet\u0026quot; like so:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MySummary2ID\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;layoutSet\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MyLayoutSet\u0026#34; } } In this case, you would have a layoutSet called MyLayoutSet in your project. This would render a summary of all the pages and components in the layoutSet.\nRendering summaries of previous tasks You can also render summaries of components, pages and layoutSets that exist in previous tasks.\nTo do this, simply specify the target.taskId like so:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary2-previous-page\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;page\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AddressPage\u0026#34; } } The behaviour is exactly like before with regard to target.type and target.id, except that a taskId property has been added.\nOverrides For each component in your summary, you can configure different overrides to suit your needs.\nTo configure an override, use the override field of the Summary2 component like so:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MySummary2ID\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MyComponentID\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;overrides\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;componentId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MyComponentID\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;displayType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; } ] } Here are the overrides that are common for all components:\nParameter Type Required Description componentId string yes ID of the compoment you are overriding hidden boolean no Exclude the component from summary forceShowInSummary boolean no Will force show the component in a summary even if hideEmptyFields is set to true in the summary component. emptyFieldText string no Custom text to show for empty fields. hideEmptyFields boolean no Exclude empty fields for summary. Only works if the field is not required. isCompact boolean no Option to display a more compact version. (Map, Paragraph and Header does not have this) In addition, a few components support component-specific overrides:\nCheckbox and MultipleSelect Parameter Type Required Description displayType enum: list | string no Display the summary as a list or string RepeatingGroup and Subform Parameter Type Required Description display enum: table | full no Display the summary as a table or as fully expanded "

	"description": "It is always a good idea to do user testing in multiple stages of a project. Through user testing you measure if your solution corresponds to the needs of the users. Doing this early in the project is a good investment, since you save time and money by avoiding developing a solution that doesn&#39;t match what it was trying to solve.",
	"content": "User testing does not have to be advanced with setup, or the amount of test subjects in mind. A rule of thumb is that if you have tested a system on 5 people you\u0026rsquo;ve discovered 80% of the usability flaws (Jacob Nielsen).\nYou will have to adjust your form after the usability testing. It could be bigger things, like navigation or flow, but also smaller adjustments like language or alterations within the interaction-design. If larger changes are required it might be a good idea to do another user test to check if the new changes have had the desired effect.\nA sign that you have successfully created a solution that fits the users requirements is if most of the users in your usability test are able to complete their task without your help, and within a reasonable timeframe.\nUsablility testing in Figma Have you set up a prototype in Figma by using our Prototype-Kit? Great! You can now use this for usability testing!\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve added multiple steps in your form, you have to remember to link between these steps. You can do this by choosing \u0026ldquo;Prototype\u0026rdquo; in the right-upper corner in Figma. Select a frame or a button and notice the little white dot that shows up to the right of the item you selected. This dot can be grabbed and pulled over to the frame you wish the button to lead to.\nThere is a flow for every starting alternative, along with a flow for the mobile sketches. Press the play button on the prototype you want to try out. After it has started you can switch between the different flows in the left margin.\nBrukertesting i Figma You can share the files with the testers if you click the \u0026ldquo;share\u0026rdquo; button in the top right of the window. you can either choose that the file should be open to anyone who opens the link, or that only people that are invited (via email) should have access.\nGood advice for user testing Test early with real users The user friendliness can only be measured if it is tested on the solutions target userbase. testing early is cheaper than fixing eventual problems that are uncovered during production. Render the test harmless Explain to the test subject that the purpose of the test isn\u0026rsquo;t to test them, but to discover eventual mistakes or faults in the service so that it can be fixed or improved. Ask the test subject to think out loud. For some, thinking out loud will come naturally while others might need a reminder every once in a while. Don\u0026rsquo;t ask leading questions, show that you want to hear the test subjects thoughts and their feedback. Listen Remember to give the test subject room for thought, and keep in mind that you should focus on listening. Give the test more than enough time to avoid a stressed environment. Remind yourself of the purpose of the test Feedback from the test subject can easily be interpreted as a critique of your own work, remind yourself that you want the best result as possible for the quality of your service. Creating tasks for the test Spend plenty of time formulating the tasks for your user test, doing a pilot-test ahead of the real one will let you discover errors with the actual test.\nSet a clear goal for what the participant is trying to achieve choose tasks that are relevant and credible Don\u0026rsquo;t give away the answer or give to many hints You can find more tips on how to complete the test in the best way possible on the site gov.uk\nAfter the test You have likely found some things that you should improve after you have completed a couple of usability tests. After any changes to the form layout or flow of your form you should consider doing another round of usability testing.\nYou will soon be ready for developing!

	"description": "An overview of configuration options for monitoring in Altinn Apps.",
	"content": "This page refers to configuration when OpenTelemetry (OTel) is enabled in the app from v8 and newer. The existing Application Insights SDK setup is obsolete and will be removed in the next major version of the Altinn.App libraries. The new monitoring and instrumentation setup is enabled by setting UseOpenTelemetry to true in appsettings.json or equivalent.\n{ \u0026#34;AppSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;UseOpenTelemetry\u0026#34;: true } } When this flag is enabled, OTel is configured as opposed to the classic Application Insights SDK. All the telemetry is then shipped by default to the local monitoring setup with running locally, and to Azure Monitor when the app is deployed in an environment. Optionally, if an instrumentation key or Application Insights connection string is added to AppSettings or environment locally, Altinn.App will ship the telemetry to Azure Monitor. When the app is run, you will both get auto-instrumentation based on HTTP (traces and metrics), but also manual trace spans and metrics that are domain specific.\nThe next sections will describe customizing the OpenTelemetry SDK and migrating from Application Insights. On the next page, there is information on automatic and manual instrumentation.\nConfiguring the OpenTelemetry SDK If you need to customize OTel in any way, you can use the extension methods below to get the appropriate provider-builder from the OTel SDK. This is relevant if you\nNeed custom enrichment Customize sampling Need to export telemetry to a different backend In this case, the configuration only adds an additional exporter (ConsoleExporter) to the respective provider-builders.\nFirst, we update the App.csproj file:\n\u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.9.0\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Then we update the configuration code in Program.cs:\nusing OpenTelemetry.Logs; using OpenTelemetry.Metrics; using OpenTelemetry.Trace; void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // Configure exporters for telemetry signals (metrics, traces and logging). // Here console exporters are used for demonstration purposes. // This could also ship your telemetry to a custom backend. services.ConfigureOpenTelemetryMeterProvider(builder =\u0026gt; builder.AddConsoleExporter( (_, readerOptions) =\u0026gt; { // Lower the export interval so that we get metrics more often readerOptions.PeriodicExportingMetricReaderOptions.ExportIntervalMilliseconds = 5_000; readerOptions.PeriodicExportingMetricReaderOptions.ExportTimeoutMilliseconds = 4_000; } ) ); services.ConfigureOpenTelemetryTracerProvider(builder =\u0026gt; { // Customize sampling builder.SetSampler(new ParentBasedSampler(new AlwaysOnSampler())); builder.AddConsoleExporter(); }); services.ConfigureOpenTelemetryLoggerProvider(builder =\u0026gt; builder.AddConsoleExporter()); } To learn more about what can be configured, read the respective docs on the opentelemetry-dotnet repo:\nCustomizing OpenTelemetry .NET SDK for Tracing Customizing OpenTelemetry .NET SDK for Logs Customizing OpenTelemetry .NET SDK for Metrics Migration from classic Application Insights SDK Microsoft have documented that\nThe long-term plan for Application Insights is to collect data using OpenTelemetry.\nWhich means that the classic SDK that we now use is likely to be deprecated at some point. It is therefore recommended to migrate when possible, by following the instructions above.\nTelemetry initializers and processors need to be migrated to the respective OTel abstractions.\nApplication Insights OpenTelemetry ITelemetryInitializer Processor ITelemetryProcessor Processor Considerations Both OTel and App Insights SDK use W3C Trace-Context propagation by default for distributed traces, so correlation across systems should still work during a migration "

When this file is added, and exports a Config object, you can run yarn gen to generate the TypeScript types and JsonSchema types for your component as well.\nAt that point you can start implementing the index.tsx file, that defines the React component that renders the form component, along with any other (dynamic) configuration needed for the component.\nMake sure to consider the following when creating a new component:\nHow should the component be displayed when referenced in a Summary component? It might need some overriding in index.tsx to display correctly. Should it be possible to render the component inside a table/Grid-component, etc? Test it and make sure it looks good. Consider adding automated tests for your component, and add it to our frontend-test app. This app is regularly tested using Cypress, and will help you catch any regressions in your component over time. Once this is done, the component is ready to use, and can be added to the layout file of an app and used.\n"

	"content": "This page refers to configuration when OpenTelemetry (OTel) is enabled in the app from v8 and newer. The existing Application Insights SDK setup is obsolete and will be removed in the next major version of the Altinn.App libraries. Instrumentation is about adding additional context and information for you to use when debugging or analyzing app health or performance. Instrumentation through OpenTelemetry can take the form of 3 signal types:\nTraces Logs Metrics By default, automatic instrumentation is added for HTTP server and client requests, which will automatically capture all requests coming from the user/fronend to the API of the app, and all downstream requests to Platform APIs and any other HTTP-based integration that has been built into the app. This instrumentation follows the semantic conventions of the OTel spec in terms of attributes.\nFor manual instrumentation, you should also make sure to follow semantic conventions where applicable. The Altinn.App.Core library has mechanisms for doing manual instrumentation while standardizing on attribute names and values for Altinn-specific data and identifiers. This is done through the Altinn.App.Core.Features.Telemetry class and extension methods on System.Diagnostics.Activity.\nDistributed tracing Distributed tracing is done through System.Diagnostics.ActivitySource and System.Diagnostics.Activity in .NET. Alternatively, there is a shim API provided by the OTel SDK that simply wraps the Activity API that can be used.\nDistributed tracing consists of\nTraces - a collection of spans, identified by a Trace ID Spans - a unit of work with a start and a stop timestamp, identified by a Span ID with a pointer to a parent Span ID A trace can be thought of as a tree of spans, letting us visualize and analyze units of work in context and in relation to other spans in the same trace. Traces can be used in roughly the same way as logs in terms of debugging and analysis, but offers richer context, which is especially useful in a distributed setting. Altinn 3 is a microservices-based platform, so utilizing distributed tracing is highly recommended and should be the primary tool for debugging and observing apps.\nHere is an example of a client that implements Bring\u0026rsquo;s API (as part of the Altinn app development course), which has been instrumented with a domain specific span/activity:\ninternal sealed class BringClient( IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory, Telemetry telemetry ) { public async Task\u0026lt;PostalCodeLookupResult\u0026gt; LookupPostalCode(int postalCode, CancellationToken cancellationToken) { using var activity = telemetry.ActivitySource.StartActivity(\u0026#34;PostalCodeLookup\u0026#34;); activity?.SetTag(\u0026#34;address.postalcode\u0026#34;, postalCode); using var client = httpClientFactory.CreateClient(); using var response = await client.GetAsync( $\u0026#34;https://fraktguide.bring.no/fraktguide/api/postalCode.json?country=no\u0026amp;pnr={postalCode}\u0026#34;, cancellationToken ); response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode(); return await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync\u0026lt;PostalCodeLookupResult\u0026gt;(cancellationToken); } } In the case above, we create a single span wrapping the HTTP client operation, and add the postal code as additional context. We then know that if this API fails, we can at least verify that the postal code was something that we expected. Remember, automatic instrumentation will make sure to inject an additional span below ours, where we can inspect HTTP-specific attributes such as status code, URL and other information as per OTel semantic conventions. As we encounter errors or analyze the potential failure conditions of the code, we might decide to add error handling for the postal code. Thinking about instrumentation, observability and failure modes during development often leads to more robust code:\ninternal sealed class BringClient( IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory, Telemetry telemetry ) { public async Task\u0026lt;PostalCodeLookupResult\u0026gt; LookupPostalCode(int postalCode, CancellationToken cancellationToken) { using var activity = telemetry.ActivitySource.StartActivity(\u0026#34;PostalCodeLookup\u0026#34;); activity?.SetTag(\u0026#34;address.postalcode\u0026#34;, postalCode); if (postalCode is \u0026lt; 1000 or \u0026gt; 9999) throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(postalCode), \u0026#34;Must be a valid postal code\u0026#34;); // ... } } There are also extension methods on System.Diagnostics.Activity? for setting domain-specific tags, such as a User ID, Party ID, Instance ID and Process Task ID. In the code below, we provide additional context by attaching the user party ID to the trace. In this case, that attribute will already be present on a parent span thanks to the included instrumentation Altinn.App libraries, but it serves as an example.\ninternal sealed class BringClient( IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory, Telemetry telemetry, IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor ) { public async Task\u0026lt;PostalCodeLookupResult\u0026gt; LookupPostalCode(int postalCode, CancellationToken cancellationToken) { var httpContext = httpContextAccessor.HttpContext; if (httpContext is null) throw new InvalidOperationException(\u0026#34;Can\u0026#39;t lookup postal code without running the context of a users HTTP request\u0026#34;); var partyIdStr = httpContext.User?.Claims.FirstOrDefault(c =\u0026gt; c.Type == \u0026#34;urn:altinn:partyid\u0026#34;)?.Value; if (partyIdStr is null || !int.TryParse(partyIdStr, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, out var partyId)) throw new Exception(\u0026#34;Couldn\u0026#39;t fetch information on current user\u0026#34;); using var activity = telemetry.ActivitySource.StartActivity(\u0026#34;PostalCodeLookup\u0026#34;); activity?.SetUserPartyId(partyId); activity?.SetTag(\u0026#34;address.postalcode\u0026#34;, postalCode); if (postalCode is \u0026lt; 1000 or \u0026gt; 9999) throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(postalCode), \u0026#34;Must be a valid postal code\u0026#34;); // ... } } Resources Read more about distributed tracing at\n.NET docs OpenTelemetry.io docs opentelemetry-dotnet docs on Github Logging Logging is done through injecting the Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger interface where needed. Logs are automatically shipped through the configured OTel exporters (localtest OTel collector if running locally, Azure Monitor when deployed).\nBelow we have modified our BringClient to log information messages for postal codes that are looked up:\ninternal sealed class BringClient( IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory, Telemetry telemetry, ILogger\u0026lt;BringClient\u0026gt; logger ) { public async Task\u0026lt;PostalCodeLookupResult\u0026gt; LookupPostalCode(int postalCode, CancellationToken cancellationToken) { using var activity = telemetry.ActivitySource.StartActivity(\u0026#34;PostalCodeLookup\u0026#34;); activity?.SetTag(\u0026#34;address.postalcode\u0026#34;, postalCode); if (postalCode is \u0026lt; 1000 or \u0026gt; 9999) throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(postalCode), \u0026#34;Must be a valid postal code\u0026#34;); logger.LogInformation(\u0026#34;Looking up postal code information - PostalCode={PostalCode}\u0026#34;, postalCode); // ... } } Resources Read more about logging at\n.NET docs opentelemetry-donet docs on Github OpenTelemetry.io docs Metrics Metric instrumentation is done through System.Diagnostics.Metrics.Meter and\nSystem.Diagnostics.Metrics.Counter\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; System.Diagnostics.Metrics.UpDownCounter\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; System.Diagnostics.Metrics.ObservableCounter\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; System.Diagnostics.Metrics.ObservableUpDownCounter\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; System.Diagnostics.Metrics.ObservableGauge\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; System.Diagnostics.Metrics.Histogram\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; Read the .NET and OTel docs below for the differences between these types.\nMetrics are mostly useful for coarse aggregation of timeseries, to provide high level insight into the state of of an app or across multiple apps. Timeseries can then be visualized to create a baseline of expectations. In the future we will also be able to create alerts based on these metrics.\nWe continue to expand on the BringClient example, where we now cache the API respones and make sure to track the cache hitrate using metrics. With metrics we have to consider\nInstruments (e.g. Counter) should not be created often, so we register the service as a Singleton We use Telemetry.Metrics.CreateName to standardize on metric names We use a memory cache and have attributes/tags tracking internal static class BringClientDI { public static IServiceCollection AddBringClient(this IServiceCollection services) { services.AddSingleton\u0026lt;BringClient\u0026gt;(); // Counters shouldn\u0026#39;t be created/retrieved often, so we use Singleton here return services; } } internal sealed class BringClient( IHttpClientFactory httpClientFactory, Telemetry telemetry ) { private readonly MemoryCache _cache = new MemoryCache(new MemoryCacheOptions() { SizeLimit = 10_000 }); private readonly MemoryCacheEntryOptions _cacheEntryOptions = new MemoryCacheEntryOptions() { Size = 1, AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromHours(24) }; private readonly Counter\u0026lt;long\u0026gt; _counter = telemetry.Meter.CreateCounter\u0026lt;long\u0026gt;( Telemetry.Metrics.CreateName(\u0026#34;bring_client_lookup_poststed_requests\u0026#34;) // CreateName prefixes the metric name with \u0026#39;altinn_app\u0026#39; ); public async Task\u0026lt;PostalCodeLookupResult\u0026gt; LookupPostalCode(int postalCode, CancellationToken cancellationToken) { using var activity = telemetry.ActivitySource.StartActivity(\u0026#34;PostalCodeLookup\u0026#34;); var key = $\u0026#34;{nameof(LookupPostalCode)}-{postalCode}\u0026#34;; if (postalCode is \u0026lt; 1000 or \u0026gt; 9999) throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(postalCode), \u0026#34;Must be a valid postal code\u0026#34;); KeyValuePair\u0026lt;string, object?\u0026gt; tag; // This will let us calculate cache hitrate if (_cache.TryGetValue(key, out PostalCodeLookupResult? result)) { if (result is null) throw new Exception(\u0026#34;Null value was cached\u0026#34;); tag = new KeyValuePair\u0026lt;string, object?\u0026gt;(\u0026#34;cache.hit\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;); return result; } else { tag = new KeyValuePair\u0026lt;string, object?\u0026gt;(\u0026#34;cache.hit\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;false\u0026#34;); } activity?.SetTag(tag.Key, tag.Value); _counter.Add(1, tag); using var client = httpClientFactory.CreateClient(); using var response = await client.GetAsync( $\u0026#34;https://fraktguide.bring.no/fraktguide/api/postalCode.json?country=no\u0026amp;pnr={postalCode}\u0026#34;, cancellationToken ); response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode(); result = await response.Content.ReadFromJsonAsync\u0026lt;PostalCodeLookupResult\u0026gt;(cancellationToken) ?? throw new Exception(\u0026#34;Could not deserialize postal code lookup result\u0026#34;); _cache.Set(key, result, _cacheEntryOptions); return result; } } Resources Read more about metrics at\n.NET docs OpenTelemetry.io docs opentelemetry-dotnet docs on Github Migration from classic Application Insights SDK Microsoft have documented that\nThe long-term plan for Application Insights is to collect data using OpenTelemetry.\nWhich means that the classic SDK that we now use is likely to be deprecated at some point. It is therefore recommended to migrate when possible, by following the instructions above.\nIf you have manual instrumentation using TelemetryClient from the classic Application Insights SDK, these need to be migrated to OTel equivalents. The Application Insights SDK also ships logs based on the ILogger abstraction, so the only places where change is needed is for telemetry not using that API (traces, metrics, and anything else from the Application Insights datamodel)\nThe Application Insights datamodel is different from OTel. See the mapping table below for recommendations:\nApplication Insights OpenTelemetry System.Diagnostics API Request Span Activity Exception Span with span event Activity with Activity.AddEvent Dependency Span Activity Event Span, span event, logs Activity/Activity.AddEvent/ILogger Trace Span, logs Activity/ILogger Metric Metrics Metric "

Resources used for correspondences should use the resource type correspondence service. You can read about resources and access management here: Authorization\nAccess Management for attachments Our solution allows you to control the access to attachments on a Correspondence. In some cases, the person responsible for distributing incoming mail within the organization should not be able to view the attachment. A typical example is when the Police send their Correspondence \u0026ldquo;Straffesaksforsendelse\u0026rdquo;.\nThe organization can grant access to the Correspondence to the person responsible for distributing it to the appropriate caseworkers, but without giving them access to read the attachment.\nHow to set the access management for an attachment The access management for an attachment is controlled by the resource used when initializing the attachment. When a correspondence with an attachment is initialized collectively using the initialize and upload endpoint, the created attachments will have the same resource as the correspondence.\nTo get unique access management for the correspondence and its attachments, they must be initialized separately using different resources:\nInitialize the attachments with their own resource that defines who is allowed to view or download those attachments. Initialize the correspondence with the attachments as existing attachments and with a resource that defines who is allowed to read the correspondence.

	"content": "What is Confidential information in Altinn? Confidential information is a messaging service designed to send particularly sensitive information (for example, regarding individuals involved in criminal cases or child welfare cases). Only those who are responsible for processing such sensitive information should have access to read it. Therefore, the access control for confidential information is stricter than for other messaging services. Note that the message will be invisible in the recipient\u0026rsquo;s inbox until someone has been granted access (through an individual services or a role/access package).\nNo one is automatically granted access to confidential information For other types of messages sent via Altinn, most key roles registered in the Register of Business Enterprises at the Brønnøysund Register Centre are automatically granted read access.\nThese key roles are:\nGeneral Manager (Daglig leder) Chair of the Board (Styreleder) Sole Proprietor (Innehaver) Managing Shipowner (Bestyrende reder) Partner with unlimited liability registered with a national ID number (FNR) Partner with limited liability registered with a national ID number (FNR) Norwegian representative for a foreign entity Note that for confidential information, access is not automatically granted to key roles within the organization (such as the general manager). This is because only employees with a professional need should be able to read sensitive messages (from for example, general practitioners, child welfare services, or the police).\nAll key roles are automatically assigned as Main Administrator in Altinn. The Main Administrator can delegate all access rights in Altinn and must specifically delegate access to confidential information for anyone to be able to read such messages. Important: The person who is Main Administrator will not be able to view or read confidential messages unless they grant access to themselves.\nAccess management Since no one is automatically granted access to confidential messages, the Main Administrator must assign access rights to the person who will distribute, or process, confidential information within the organization. In some cases, the Main Administrator may need to grant access to themselves — for instance, if they are responsible for distributing the Correspondence internally or if they will be handling the case personally.\nIt is important that service owners who send confidential information are aware of this, and that any notifications sent via SMS and/or email include information on how the recipient can gain access to the message.\nRequirements for confidential information To ensure the appropriate person within the recipient organization gains access to the confidential message, it is essential that the sender adapts the message content in a way that makes it clear what the message is about and who at the recipient organization should have access.\nFor example, this can be done by using clear and specific wording in the MessageTitle field. Use the name of the correct recipient (e.g. the case officer) if known, or alternatively use a case number or other information that links the message to the appropriate person in the organization.\nNotification requirements When a message containing confidential content is created, the receiving organization MUST be notified using the Notification feature, to ensure they are made aware that a confidential message has been received in their inbox. (Note that the correspondence will be invisible in the recipient\u0026rsquo;s inbox unless someone in the organization has been granted access through an individual right or role/access package.)\nThe notification must include information stating that the message is confidential, along with instructions on what the organization must do to ensure the correct person gets access. Therefor the notification should include:\nWhat the message is about (without disclosing personal data) Who should receive the message Which specific service must be delegated to provide access, etc. We strongly recommend that the notification text is tailored to the content of the message if possible. If not, we recommend the following standard notification text:\n$recipientName$ $recipientNumber$ has received a confidential message: messageTitle from $sendersName$. To access the message, someone in $recipientName$ must be granted access to Navn på tjenesten in Altinn. The message will not be visible before someone is granted access. Read more about confidential information on Altinn’s website. Upcoming functionality Altinn is considering a solution where a separate message (Correspondence) is sent as a reminder to those with the role or access package \u0026ldquo;Mail/Archive\u0026rdquo;. This message will contain the same information as a notification – that the organization has an unopened confidential message. The reminder will be sent to the organization’s inbox after 7 days if the confidential message has not been opened.\nThink this functionality would be useful?

Note that only Norwegian organisations are supported, and that the prefix 0192: is required before the organisation number.\nAdding a feedback task to the application process While not strictly necessary, it is recommended to add a feedback task to your application. This is to ensure that the process is moved along when the message has been received.\nNo further changes are needed when the task has been added as the eFormidling service we added earlier will automatically move the process along.\nIf you wish to customize the texts that are presented to the user during this step you can do so by overriding the text keys\nEnsuring unique filenames If the message sent by your application contains multiple attachments, it is important to ensure that these have unique filenames as the shipment will fail otherwise.\nIf the message includes the generated PDF of the form, you need to check that the other filename(s) are not the same as the application name.\nOne way to ensure unique filenames is through the use of file validation.\nTesting Thorough testing for the eFormidling integration in an application is encouraged.\nSafety measures and retry mechanisms are in place to ensure that a shipment reaches the receiver when errors are due to weak network connections.\nHowever, invalid shipments, including but not limited to missing attachments or mistakes in the \u0026quot;arkivmelding\u0026quot;, will cause the shipment to fail without explicit warning to the end user or app owner.\nLocal For the time being it is not possible to test the eFormidling integration locally as efm-mocks, which is necessary for local testing, is under renovation. Test environment (TT02) You can monitor the status of a shipment sent in the test environment through the endpoint below. https://platform.tt02.altinn.no/eformidling/api/conversations?messageId={instanceGuid} {instanceGuid}: the GUID of the instance that has been archived.

	"content": "A service task for sending instance data via eFormidling is included with the app by default and can be added as a step in the process to be used.\nPreviously, this functionality was not in a service task but was built into the general code for changing process steps. If your app was set up before version 8.9, you should disable the functionality running outside the process definition by removing the configuration in applicationMetadata.json and appsettings.json. Prerequisites Before setting up eFormidling, you must have the following in place:\nVis/skjul innhold Maskinporten integration To enable eFormidling in your application, you must set up an integration between your app and Maskinporten.\nThe application automatically includes the built-in IMaskinportenClient. If you need custom configuration, you can use: App/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // Optional: Only necessary if you use a non-standard configuration path services.ConfigureMaskinportenClient(\u0026#34;CustomMaskinportenSettingsPath\u0026#34;); } Vis/skjul innhold Event subscription An event subscription must be set up to ensure that the application knows the delivery status of messages sent via eFormidling.\nAdd a new secret EventSubscription--SecretCode in Azure key vault or create your own implementation of IEventSecretCodeProvider. You determine the value of the secret.\nIn Program.cs, add the following to RegisterCustomAppServices:\nvoid RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // Optional: Only necessary if you use a non-standard configuration path services.ConfigureMaskinportenClient(\u0026#34;CustomMaskinportenSettingsPath\u0026#34;); // Configure HTTP client for Events API with Maskinporten authorization services.AddHttpClient\u0026lt;IEventsSubscription, EventsSubscriptionClient\u0026gt;() .UseMaskinportenAltinnAuthorization(\u0026#34;altinn:serviceowner/instances.read\u0026#34;); } Setting up eFormidling in your application Register eFormidling services To add support for eFormidling in your application, you must register the services by adding the following to the RegisterCustomAppServices method in Program.cs:\nApp/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { services.AddEFormidlingServices2\u0026lt;EFormidlingMetadata, EFormidlingReceivers\u0026gt;(config); } Add eFormidling as a service task in your application\u0026rsquo;s workflow Integration with eFormidling is added to the workflow as a service task. Remember that the task must have an incoming and an outgoing sequence flow.\nNote: In the future, it will be possible to drag in eFormidling directly via the Arbeidsflyt-editor in Altinn Studio, but this functionality is unfortunately not yet available.\nFor now, the following procedure is recommended:\nDrag in a regular data task in the Arbeidsflyt-editor Share the changes in Studio Manually edit process.bpmn on your own machine Convert the data task to a bpmn:serviceTask (see example below) This ensures that sequence flows and the diagram are correct.\nApp/config/process.bpmn \u0026lt;bpmn:serviceTask id=\u0026#34;Task_eFormidling\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;eFormidling\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskType\u0026gt;eFormidling\u0026lt;/altinn:taskType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:eFormidlingConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:disabled env=\u0026#34;local\u0026#34;\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;/altinn:disabled\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Prevents it from running in local development environment. --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:receiver\u0026gt;991825827\u0026lt;/altinn:receiver\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:process\u0026gt;urn:no:difi:profile:arkivmelding:administrasjon:ver1.0\u0026lt;/altinn:process\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:standard\u0026gt;urn:no:difi:arkivmelding:xsd::arkivmelding\u0026lt;/altinn:standard\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:typeVersion\u0026gt;2.0\u0026lt;/altinn:typeVersion\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:type\u0026gt;arkivmelding\u0026lt;/altinn:type\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:securityLevel\u0026gt;3\u0026lt;/altinn:securityLevel\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:dpfShipmentType\u0026gt;digital\u0026lt;/altinn:dpfShipmentType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:dataTypes\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:dataType\u0026gt;ref-data-as-pdf\u0026lt;/altinn:dataType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:dataTypes\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:eFormidlingConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_1uewkmg\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;Flow_0c1ure8\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:serviceTask\u0026gt; Property Type Description receiver string Recipient\u0026rsquo;s organization number (can be omitted).

This is to ensure that the process moves forward when the message has been received. No further changes are necessary once the task has been added, as the eFormidling service we added earlier will automatically move the process forward. If you want to customize the texts presented to the user at this stage, you can do so by overriding the text keys\nEnsuring unique filenames Filenames of attachments sent via eFormidling must be unique. The integration contains logic to guarantee this and may change the filenames slightly before the files are sent.\nTesting Thorough testing of the eFormidling integration in an application is recommended. Security measures and retry mechanisms are in place to ensure that a shipment reaches the recipient when errors are due to weak network connections. However, invalid shipments, including but not limited to missing attachments or errors in the \u0026quot;arkivmelding\u0026quot;, will cause the shipment to fail without explicit notification to the end user or app owner.\nLocal Currently, it is not possible to test the eFormidling integration locally as efm-mocks, which is necessary for local testing, is under renovation. Test environment (TT02) You can monitor the status of a shipment sent in the test environment via the endpoint below.\nhttps://platform.tt02.altinn.no/eformidling/api/conversations?messageId={instanceGuid} "

	"content": "Nuget version v8.9.0 or higher is required for an app to support Fiks Arkiv. In addition to the documentation below, we have created a sample application showing the complete Fiks Arkiv setup in an app.\nPrerequisites Before setting up the Fiks Arkiv integration in your app you will need to have the following set up:\nFiks Protokoll enabled in Fiks forvaltning portal for your organization Samarbeidsportalen access to configure Maskinporten clients (national ID provider) An archive system that integrates with Fiks Arkiv (e.g., Public 360) Integration architecture and flow Principal of message transmission through Fiks Arkiv. Fagsystem in the sketch would in this case be an Altinn App. Source of image: KS Digital\nFlow chart for Fiks Arkiv integration for an Altinn app Configuration for sending messages from Altinn App Step 1: Create a Maskinporten client Set up a Maskinporten client with scopes: ks:fiks, altinn:serviceowner/instances.read and altinn:serviceowner/instances.write Generate a JWK key pair for Maskinporten authentication and upload the public key to the newly generated Maskinporten client Keep the following configuration values for the Altinn App setup Client id for the generated Maskinporten client Public and private key of the Maskinporten JWK key pair (base64 encoded) This Maskinporten client will be used to authenticate requests from the Altinn App both towards Altinn Platform and Fiks. A detailed guide on how to set up a Maskinporten client in Samarbeidsportalen is available below.\nVis/skjul innhold Guide on how to register a new Maskinporten integration in Samarbeidsportalen Maskinporten clients are created in the self-service portal:\nFor the production environment, clients are created from: https://sjolvbetjening.samarbeid.digdir.no. For the test environment, clients are created from: https://sjolvbetjening.test.samarbeid.digdir.no. Start by logging into your account with your chosen method. When logged into your account, the organisation you represent is shown in the top menu to the right. The organisation you represent is shown in the top menu. If you logged in to represent a synthetic organisation, you will also be able to change the synthetic organisation you represent in the drop down menu on that item. You can change the synthetic organisation you represent in the drop down menu. Select the Create client button to start creating a new client for the organisation you represent. On the Add client page select Maskinporten. On the Add Maskinporten client page fill in the display name, description and add your required scopes (these values can also be changed later). Then click the Create button. The \u0026#39;Add Maskinporten client\u0026#39; page. You have now created a Maskinporten client for your organisation. To use this client you need to add at least one authentication key. The client supports JWK and PEM keys. Start by either locating an existing key or creating a new one. You can use the Altinn JWKS tool or other key generator of your choice for this. Next, navigate to the key section on your client page and select Add. Keys can be added in the key section. In the JWK or PEM format field paste your public key and click Save. The key is now added to the client. Store your private key from your JWK or PEM in a secure location, as it is used to authorize the use of this client. If you use Azure Key Vault to store your private keys, they need to be base64-encoded before uploading. The JWK or PEM public key is pasted in this field If you didn\u0026rsquo;t do so in step 5, you need to add the desired scopes to your client before it can be used. From the Scopes tab on your client definition, click the Add button. Scopes available to your organisation will be shown in the list. Select the required ones and click Submit. Step 2: Create a Fiks Arkiv account To ensure that receipts for archive messages are sent to the correct application, multiple apps cannot share one account. It is therefore recommended to set up one account per unique Altinn app. Generate a x509 certificate for Fiks Arkiv encryption.\nFormat requirements:\nPublic part: .PEM file, to be uploaded in Fiks Forvaltning Private part: .PEM formatted string, base64 encoded to be uploaded as a secret for the Altinn App. Use your preferred tool to generate the certificate. A guide is available at the end of this section.\nIn Fiks Forvaltning, set up a new system under Fiks Protokoll for your organization. KS Digital\u0026rsquo;s system setup guide\nCreate an account linked to this system. KS Digital\u0026rsquo;s account setup guide\nThe account should be configured with the following properties\nProperty Value Protokolltype no.ks.fiks.arkiv Versjon v1 Protokollparter klient.arkivering / klient.full* * klient.arkivering should be used unless the account will be used for other tasks as well.\nKeep the following configuration values for the Altinn App setup\nIntegration ID and password of the Fiks system The account ID of the Fiks account Private part of the x509 certificate as a base64 string Vis/skjul innhold Guide on how to generate a x509 self-signed certificate Prerequisites\nOpenSSL installed on your machine.\nA quick Google search will point you to installation instructions for your operating system. Generate SSL Certificate and Private Key\nOpen a console where openssl is available, navigate to a suitable directory, and run:\nopenssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout private.pem -out public.pem -days 720 Explanation of Flags\nreq -x509: Generate a X.509 certificate. -newkey rsa:2048: Create a new RSA key with 2048-bit encryption. -nodes: Do not encrypt the private key. -keyout private.pem: Output private key to private.pem. -out public.pem: Output certificate to public.pem. -days 720: Valid for 720 days. Answer any prompts with values representing your organization, or leave them blank if you prefer.\nResult: Two files will be created in the directory:\npublic.pem (certificate) private.pem (private key) Base64 Encode the Private Key\nWindows\nUse certutil to encode the private key:\ncertutil -encode -f \u0026#34;private.pem\u0026#34; \u0026#34;privatebase64.txt\u0026#34; This generates a file privatebase64.txt containing the private key as a Base64-encoded string.\nLinux / macOS Use the base64 command:\nbase64 private.pem \u0026gt; privatebase64.txt This creates privatebase64.txt with the Base64-encoded private key.\nNotes\nKeep your private key secure. Do not share private.pem or its Base64 representation publicly. The generated certificate (public.pem) can be distributed as needed. Troubleshooting\nOpenSSL not found: Ensure it’s installed and added to your system PATH. Permission issues: Run the commands with appropriate privileges or in a directory where you have write access. Invalid Base64 output: Verify the original file exists and is readable before encoding. Step 3: Configure and prepare the Altinn App The Altinn Fiks package automatically handles a lot of the integration for you. The simplest setup for a Fiks Integration involves setting up configuration values for connection to Maskinporten and Fiks, as well as specifying which data should be sent to Fiks and who the recipient is.\nThat being said, all interfaces can be overridden with custom logic should you wish to have more control yourself. The standard way is what is described here, but interfaces will be mentioned for those that wish for more control.\nAdd a reference to the NuGet package Altinn.App.Clients.Fiks in your project file. The package version should match the version of the Altinn.App.Core and Altinn.App.Api packages. App/App.csproj \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Api\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;8.9.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;CopyToOutputDirectory\u0026gt;lib\\$(TargetFramework)\\*.xml\u0026lt;/CopyToOutputDirectory\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/PackageReference\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Core\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;8.9.0\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Clients.Fiks\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;8.9.0\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Register all Fiks Arkiv dependencies including required configuration in the program file.

All sensitive values should be registered in Azure Key Vault, and not checked in to appsettings.json.\nVis/skjul innhold Overview of Maskinporten configuration The client id for the Maskinporten client generated in step 1 and the base64-encoded public and private key should be added as ClientId and JwkBase64 in the MaskinportenSettings section.\nSetting Name Description Authority The Maskinporten authority/audience to use for authentication and authorization. ClientId The client ID which has been registered with Maskinporten. Typically a uuid4 string. JwkBase64 The private key used to authenticate with Maskinporten, in Base64 encoded JWK format.

Defaults to Altinn Studio if not provided. RuleId Optional rule ID for processing the incoming message in systems that support rule IDs. Omitted if not provided. CaseFileId ID for the generated case file (saksmappe element). Defaults to the instance identifier if not provided. CaseFileTitle Title for the generated saksmappe tittel element. Defaults to the application title if not provided. JournalEntryTitle Title for the generated journalpost tittel element. Defaults to the application title if not provided. Metadata support both static and dynamic configuration formats - see How Values Are Provided for syntax and use DataModelBinding when fields differ per instance.\nExample configuration:\nApp/appsettings.json \u0026#34;FiksArkivSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Metadata\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;JournalEntryTitle\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;DataModelBinding\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;DataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;HelperDataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;JournalEntryTitle\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;CaseFileTitle\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;DataModelBinding\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;DataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;HelperDataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CaseFileTitle\u0026#34; } } } } Documents (FiksArkivSettings.Documents) Definition of the documents to include in the archive message (arkivmelding) that is sent to Fiks Arkiv.\nSetting Name Purpose PrimaryDocument The main document (e.g., form data or PDF) sent as Hoveddokument. Attachments Optional additional documents sent as Vedlegg (array of attachments). Each document entry typically uses DataType to indicate the source and/or format. For example, \u0026quot;ref-data-as-pdf\u0026quot; for a PDF generated from reference data.\nExample configuration:\nApp/appsettings.json \u0026#34;FiksArkivSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Documents\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;PrimaryDocument\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;DataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ref-data-as-pdf\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;Attachments\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;DataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;DataModel\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;DataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vedlegg-datatype\u0026#34; } ] } } ErrorHandling (FiksArkivErrorHandlingSettings) What the application should do when a send attempt fails.\nSetting Name Purpose Type MoveToNextTask Whether to automatically progress to the next task on failure. bool Action The action to send when progressing in process after failure (default: reject). string Example configuration:\nApp/appsettings.json \u0026#34;FiksArkivSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ErrorHandling\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;MoveToNextTask\u0026#34;: true } } SuccessHandling (FiksArkivSuccessHandlingSettings) What the application should do when a send attempt succeeds.\nSetting Name Purpose Type MoveToNextTask Whether to automatically progress to the next task on success. bool Action The action to send when progressing in process after success. string MarkInstanceComplete Whether to mark the instance as completed after success. bool Example configuration:\nApp/appsettings.json \u0026#34;FiksArkivSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;SuccessHandling\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;MoveToNextTask\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;MarkInstanceComplete\u0026#34;: true } } Practical Tips Start simple: Configure Recipient and Metadata first; add Documents and Receipt details as needed. Use binding for variability: Prefer DataModelBinding for fields that vary per instance or environment. Keep defaults in mind: If you omit certain metadata fields, sensible defaults (like application title) are used. Actions \u0026amp; flow: Set ErrorHandling and SuccessHandling to align with your process (e.g., move to next task, mark instance complete). How Values Are Provided Each setting can be supplied in one of two ways:\nStatic (hard-coded) value\n\u0026#34;JournalEntryTitle\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hallo\u0026#34; } Dynamic value via data model binding\n\u0026#34;CaseFileTitle\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;DataModelBinding\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;DataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;HelperDataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CaseFileTitle\u0026#34; } } Use Value when you know the text upfront; use DataModelBinding when values should come from your runtime data (e.g., fields collected in a form or helper model).\nTroubleshooting Missing titles: If journal or case file titles are empty, check that your DataModelBinding points to existing fields, or provide a Value. Incorrect recipient: Verify that FiksAccount contains a valid GUID and matches the intended recipient. Attachment resolution: Ensure each attachment DataType is defined in applicationmetadata. Define desired process flow for the application\nThe recommended process flow for an application using Fiks Arkiv is depicted below. The feedback step is necessary to allow for a response from the asynchronous process of sending the archive message and receiving a response before confirming to the user that the sending was successful.\nDefine the policy for the application\nEnsure that each task in the process flow has authorization rules linked to them specifying which entities are allowed to complete which actions given a specific state.\nOverriding standard behavior If the standard archive message and functionality does not cover what you need in your archive message, it is possible to override the implementation of functionality for archive message generation and processing the response from the receiving Fiks account.\nOverride archive message generation The interface to implement is IFiksArkivPayloadGenerator.\nIf your implemented class is called OverridePayloadGenerator, the service registration will be as follows:\nApp/Program.cs services .AddFiksArkiv() .WithPayloadGenerator\u0026lt;OverridePayloadGenerator\u0026gt;() Override response message processing The interface to implement is IFiksArkivResponseHandler.\nIf your implemented class is called OverrideResponseHandler, the service registration will be as follows:\nApp/Program.cs services .AddFiksArkiv() .WithResponseHandler\u0026lt;OverrideResponseHandler\u0026gt;(); Configuration for receiving messages in archive system As Digdir does not offer the archive system or Fiks Arkiv, we do not have extensive documentation here, but recommend that the application developer reference KS Digital\u0026rsquo;s documentation along side the documentation of the archive system provider.\nHowever, as more application owners make use of the integration we have seen a few common pit falls. These along with solutions are listed below, to be used at your convenience.\nCreate a Fiks Arkiv account For your organization, set up a new system under Fiks Protokoll\nCreate an account linked to this system\nThe account should be configured with the following properties\nProperty Value Protokolltype no.ks.fiks.arkiv Versjon v1 Protokollparter arkiv.full Pick a name for the account that reflects the Altinn app, as it is recommended that a new account is set up for each Altinn App one wants to integrate with the archive system.\nPlease reference archive system documentation on requirements for the encryption key pair.\nUnder the account, navigate to the Søk etter systemer tab and look up the system created to send messages. Grant this system permission to send messages to the recipient account by clicking Gi tilgang. Known issues in configuration of Public 360 The encryption key is not documented The maskinporten token uploaded in P360 is used as the private part of the encryption key the Fiks Arkiv account that receives messages should upload the public part of this certificate as the encryption key.\nExternal documentation More on Fiks Arkiv:\nhttps://developers.fiks.ks.no/felles/integrasjoner/ https://github.com/ks-no/fiks-arkiv-specification/wiki "

This includes\nThe name of the party (full name for persons, or organization name). The identifier for the party, which can be used when searching for dialogs Whether the party is the current user Whether the user has any special roles for the party Note that organizations might have child/parent relations (one level). An end-user might have access to a child organization, but not its parent, however the parent will still be included for viewing purposes, but is flagged as only being present to indicate the hierarchy.\nAlso note that deleted organizations will also be included. For full details, see the reference link below.\nRead more\nReference information about authorized parties How to search for and filter dialogs in Dialogporten Basic steps (GraphQL) This section is incomplete While we're working on it, contributions are also very welcome.

	"description": "How to set up PDF generation as a service task",
	"content": "Overview The app can generate PDFs as a standard service task that you add as a step in the process.\nPreviously, this functionality was not in a service task but was built into the general code for changing process steps. If you set up the app before version 8.9, you should disable the functionality that runs outside the process definition.\nYou do this by turning off \u0026ldquo;enablePdfGeneration\u0026rdquo; on all data types.\nBenefits of migrating to a service task: You can retry if PDF generation fails, without running \u0026ldquo;process next\u0026rdquo; again. This avoids unintended side effects. You can create multiple PDFs from one task, or combine multiple tasks into one PDF. In the future, PDF generation can run as a background job with automatic retries and better scaling. Requires at least version 8.9.0 of the Altinn NuGet packages. Setup You can use the Arbeidsflyt tab in Altinn Studio to add a PDF service task.\nAdd PDF service task Drag and drop the PDF service task to where in the process you want to generate a PDF, often right after a data task.\nOnce you have placed the task, a configuration panel opens on the right side of the screen. There you choose between two approaches: standard or custom PDF.\nVis/skjul innhold Standard PDF based on previous tasks If you select this option, you specify which previous tasks should be included in the PDF. The content is based on the components in the selected tasks, displayed in summary mode. This function does not respect the pdfLayoutName configuration in Settings.json.\nExample setup standard PDF Altinn Studio inserts a service task into process.bpmn. The result may differ slightly from the example below.\nApp/config/process/process.bpmn \u0026lt;bpmn:serviceTask id=\u0026#34;Pdf\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;PDF\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskType\u0026gt;pdf\u0026lt;/altinn:taskType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action\u0026gt;reject\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Added using \u0026#34;Handlinger\u0026#34;, if the user should be able, for instance, go backwards in the process. --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:pdfConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:filenameTextResourceKey\u0026gt;pdfFileName\u0026lt;/altinn:filenameTextResourceKey\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:autoPdfTaskIds\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskId\u0026gt;Task_Utfylling1\u0026lt;/altinn:taskId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:autoPdfTaskIds\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:pdfConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_0er70tq\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;Flow_19ikt1z\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:serviceTask\u0026gt; Vis/skjul innhold Custom PDF with its own layout-set If you select this option, you can determine the content of the PDF yourself by defining your own layout set for the PDF service task.\nYou first provide a name for the layout set and then choose a data model as the default model for the set. You can, for example, choose the model of one of the tasks included in the PDF.\nExample setup custom PDF Altinn Studio inserts a service task into process.bpmn and generates the layout-set files, but without content in PdfLayout.json.\nApp/config/process/process.bpmn \u0026lt;bpmn:serviceTask id=\u0026#34;Pdf\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;PDF\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskType\u0026gt;pdf\u0026lt;/altinn:taskType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action\u0026gt;reject\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Added using \u0026#34;Handlinger\u0026#34;, if the user should be able, for instance, go backwards in the process. --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:pdfConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:filenameTextResourceKey\u0026gt;pdfFileName\u0026lt;/altinn:filenameTextResourceKey\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:pdfConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;SequenceFlow_0c458hu\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;SequenceFlow_5assd2s\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:serviceTask\u0026gt; Layout-set The PDF service task needs its own layout set to define the content. If you use the Arbeidsflyt-editor, Altinn Studio generates this automatically. You then only need to edit the content in PdfLayout.json.\nThe files and folder structure should look approximately like this:\nApp/ui/ ├── layout-sets.json ├── form/ │ ├── Settings.json │ └── layouts/ │ └── ... └── Pdf/ ├── Settings.json └── layouts/ ├── PdfLayout.json └── ServiceTask.json layout-sets.json App/ui/layout-sets.json { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout-sets.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sets\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;form\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Task_Utfylling1\u0026#34; ] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Pdf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Pdf\u0026#34; ] } ], \u0026#34;uiSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;taskNavigation\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_Utfylling1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Utfylling\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;receipt\u0026#34; } ] } } Settings.json App/ui/Pdf/Settings.json { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;pdfLayoutName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;PdfLayout\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;ServiceTask\u0026#34; ] } } PdfLayout.json In this file, you define the content of the PDF.

Feel free to customise.\nIf you want to allow the user to abort the service task, for example to go back to the previous task, you must add the reject action to the process definition (see the XML examples above) and grant rights to the action in the app\u0026rsquo;s access policy. Where the user is redirected depends on the sequence flows in the BPMN process.\nApp/ui/Pdf/layouts/ServiceTask.json { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;L\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;service-task-title\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Header\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;service_task_custom_pdf_default.title\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;service-task-body\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Paragraph\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;service_task_custom_pdf_default.body\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;service-task-help-text\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Paragraph\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;service_task_custom_pdf_default.help_text\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;service-task-button-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ButtonGroup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;service-task-retry-button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;service-task-back-button\u0026#34; ] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;service-task-retry-button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;service_task_custom_pdf_default.retry_button\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;service-task-back-button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ActionButton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;service_task_custom_pdf_default.back_button\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;reject\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;buttonStyle\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;secondary\u0026#34; } ] } } Filename Including \u0026lt;altinn:filenameTextResourceKey\u0026gt; is optional.

You must use the actual ID of the data model, e.g. dataModel.model. Testing Fill out the form and proceed. When you reach the PDF service task in the workflow, the app generates the PDF and automatically proceeds to the next step in the process, for example the receipt.\nTroubleshooting If you get an error message that the service task failed during PDF generation, you can open the form in the app and add the query parameter pdf=1. You will then see the same content the PDF should have displayed, and any error messages.\n"

	"description": "How to set up PDF generation for subforms",
	"content": "Overview The subform PDF service task allows you to generate separate PDF documents for each instance of a subform.\nThis functionality generates multiple PDFs during a single HTTP request to the app backend. There are limitations on how many PDFs you should generate simultaneously this way. In the future, this will be able to run as a background job, and this limitation will disappear. Test with a realistic number of PDFs in the test environment to identify any limits. Requires at least version 8.9.0 of the Altinn NuGet packages. Prerequisites You have an application with one or more subforms. This guide does not cover setting up the subform itself. Setup Process.bpmn To enable PDF generation for subforms, you must add a serviceTask of type subformPdf to your workflow.\nNote: Eventually, it will be possible to drag in subform PDF directly via the Arbeidsflyt-editor in Altinn Studio, but this functionality is not yet available.\nUntil then, we recommend the following approach:\nDrag in a regular data task in the Arbeidsflyt-editor. Share the changes in Studio. Edit process.bpmn manually on your own machine. Convert the data task to a bpmn:serviceTask (see example below). This ensures that sequence flows and the diagram are correct.\n\u0026lt;bpmn:serviceTask id=\u0026#34;PdfSubform\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;PDF - subform\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskType\u0026gt;subformPdf\u0026lt;/altinn:taskType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action\u0026gt;reject\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Added using \u0026#34;Handlinger\u0026#34;, if the user should be able, for instance, go backwards in the process. --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:subformPdfConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:filenameTextResourceKey\u0026gt;subformPdfFileName\u0026lt;/altinn:filenameTextResourceKey\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:subformComponentId\u0026gt;mySubformComponentId\u0026lt;/altinn:subformComponentId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:subformDatatTypeId\u0026gt;SubformModel\u0026lt;/altinn:subformDatatTypeId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:subformPdfConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_1d4qgf7\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;Flow_1psipb3\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:serviceTask\u0026gt; Remember that the task must have an incoming and an outgoing sequence flow.\nParameters in subformPdfConfig Parameter Description filenameTextResourceKey Key to the text resource that defines the filename for the generated PDF.

You must have a copy of the component both where the subform is in the main form, and in the ServiceTask.json layout of the service task. subformDatatTypeId(*) The data type ID for the subform. Example of text resource for filename with variable:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;pdfFileName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My filename {0}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variables\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MySubformProperty\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.SubformModel\u0026#34; } ] } Layout-sets.json You must define a separate layout set for the service task that generates the PDF of the subform.\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout-sets.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sets\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;form\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;formPdf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;PdfForm\u0026#34;] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;underskjema\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SubformModel\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;underskjemaPdf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SubformModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;PdfSubform\u0026#34;] } ] } UI folder structure For each subform with PDF generation, you must have the following folder structure under App/ui/:\nApp/ui/ ├── underskjema/ │ ├── Settings.json │ └── layouts/ │ ├── Underskjema.json │ └── PdfLayout.json └── underskjemaPdf/ ├── Settings.json └── layouts/ └── ServiceTask.json underskjema/Settings.json { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;Underskjema\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;pdfLayoutName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;PdfLayout\u0026#34; } } underskjema/layout/Underskjema.json It is assumed that a subform is already defined in this file. underskjema/layout/PdfLayout.json This file defines how the PDF should look.

Where the user is redirected depends on the sequence flows in the BPMN process.\nNote: You must also add a hidden copy of the subform component to this layout for PDF generation to work correctly.

Therefore, Digdir has chosen to carry out a DPIA due to the shift from a local operational provider in Norway to an international cloud service provider.\nThe focus of this DPIA is the assessment of data protection impacts related to transitioning to a cloud service provider for the operation of Altinn 3 and mainly concerns what changes in terms of processing, risk and vulnerability assessments, necessary measures, etc., by moving the operation of Altinn to an international cloud service provider.\nThe work with the DPIA is a continuous process. There will be a need for continuous updates and changes to the DPIA for Altinn, for example, due to regulatory changes, new products being developed, etc. The reason for this latest update of the DPIA is the adequacy decision dated July 10, 2023, which applies to the transfer of personal data between the EU/EEA and the USA.\nThe obligation to ensure assessments of data protection impacts rests with the data controller, including the manager who has the daily responsibility for the particular processing. The task itself can be delegated to others.\n1.2 About Altinn Altinn is an important public common solution that all state agencies, municipalities, county councils, and other public enterprises can use to develop digital services for their users. Altinn also facilitates the need for digital dialogue between public enterprises, citizens, the business community, and the voluntary sector.\nAltinn is further developed, operated, and managed by the Altinn collaboration, consisting of several public agencies. Digdir was established on January 1, 2020, following a merger of Altinn and Difi. Digdir is responsible for the management of Altinn and decides how the technical solution should be further developed.\nAltinn started as a collaboration between the Tax Administration, Statistics Norway, and the Brønnøysund Register Centre in 2002, and was meant to be an alternative reporting channel for economic data. Altinn was officially opened by former Finance Minister Per-Kristian Foss and Minister of Trade and Industry Ansgar Gabrielsen on December 4, 2003.\nSince the portal www.altinn.no was launched, it has been growing continuously. The collaboration has been significantly expanded and consists of 71 different service owners as of December 2023.\nToday, Altinn is a well-established and extensive platform, experiencing strong growth in terms of data volumes, associated public enterprises, and the number of electronic end-user services.\nThe Altinn solution is also continuously further developed with improvements to existing functionality and new functionality.\nAltinn also contains a lot of useful information for entrepreneurs and small/medium-sized businesses under \u0026ldquo;Start and run a business\u0026rdquo; on altinn.no. Here is also an overview of all state support schemes for the business sector.\nOver 4 million private individuals have an inbox (including «archive») in Altinn through their social security number, and over 1 million businesses are registered as users through an organization number. From the start in 2003 until November 2023, over 223 million electronic forms have been submitted through Altinn, while 559 million messages have been sent to users\u0026rsquo; inboxes. This has led to savings in the billions for both the public sector and the business community. And the use of services in Altinn is continuously increasing.\nAs a protective-worthy object, Altinn is subject to the Security Act, and thus strict conditions for the security of the solution. In addition, Altinn is subject to the Personal Data Act and several other regulations that provide guidelines for, among other things, security and processing of personal data.\nSince its establishment 20 years ago, Altinn has, to a greater or lesser extent, used private providers for operation, application operation, management, and further development. If the provider processes personal data as part of its contractual relationship, a data processor agreement is also concluded with the provider. Through the Department of User Experience and Data Sharing (BOD), the directorate follows up and controls the providers. Through everything from the daily operational dialogue to contractual control and audit opportunities.\n1.3 Altinn\u0026rsquo;s Cloud Journey Altinn is on a journey from today\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;on-prem\u0026rdquo; operation and application operation of Altinn II, to a cloud-based solution for Altinn 3. Digdir has an agreement to use Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s public cloud solution Azure. The processing responsibility, purposes, or legal bases for the processes do not change in principle by cloud operation of Altinn. Digdir has chosen a data center in Norway as far as possible, and the rest are located in the EU.\nAltinn is a large IT solution with many dependencies both internally and towards external stakeholders. Therefore, it is important that a transition to the cloud can be done in several stages without disruptions or interruptions of existing end-user services.\nFor Altinn to comply with long-term goals and strategies, the solution must primarily be able to offer a new service development solution and be able to interact with other solutions and platforms in the public and private sectors. In addition, the solution must be managed and further developed more quickly and efficiently than today\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;on-prem\u0026rdquo; solution.\nThe first delivery included a new service development solution consisting of development tools (Altinn Studio), runtime environments (Altinn Apps), and a new platform with reusable micro-services (Altinn Platform). The new service development solution utilizes the possibilities and features available in a pure cloud-based infrastructure.\nAltinn 3 concept Altinn is intended to support cross-sectoral collaboration, which is also related to this new service development solution, and introduces the need for a range of other and new collaboration functions. A cloud-based solution ensures Altinn\u0026rsquo;s opportunities to support future needs for digitalization in Norway.\nThe first version of Altinn 3 was put into production in June 2020. Furthermore, the goal is that functionality will be further developed, and the services running on Altinn II will be re-established on Altinn 3 by June 2026 at the latest. There is a need for a hybrid model during this transition period, with both an \u0026ldquo;on-prem\u0026rdquo; solution and solutions in the public cloud.\nBenefits and opportunities related to the transition to the cloud include:\nReduced downtime and more self-service\nMore efficient use of resources. Not least due to higher developer productivity, fewer handovers, and overhead (opportunity for self-service). Faster realization of value from investments (shorter time from investment is made to the value of the investment is realized). Reduced time from need/idea arises, to solution is exposed to users.\nPay for what you use\nMore efficient resource utilization and the opportunity for dynamic scaling, combined with only paying for the resources one actually uses, leads to increased cost efficiency.\nIncreased efficiency in operations and delivery capability\nBy using better tools and increasing the degree of automation, resources used for operations will be reduced.\nIncreased opportunities for innovation - both internal and external innovation. The cloud provides access to new and updated technology.\nAccess to new technology\nedpb_20230118_cef_cloud-basedservices_publicsector_en.pdf (europa.eu) Page 2 and 10 in particular.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"

	"description": "Add a new component from Apps to make it configurable in Studio",
	"content": "Add a new component in Studio If new components are introduced to the Apps, either by the Apps team or by external contributors, the component can be added as a configurable component in Studio. This means that the properties for the component when used in a form, can be edited directly in Studio, just as any other component.\nStep-by-step guide Get json schema for the new component Add an icon for the component Add the new component in the list of Studio components Ensure potential other component updates are supported* Implement any potential custom config needed to support the component *Only relevant if running the schema generation script in step 1.\n1. Get json schema for the new component In order to retrieve the json schemas that defines the component config, there are different options:\nManually write the json schema based on the config.ts in the apps repo for the component. Run the script in frontend/scripts/ called generate-json-schemas for version 4 of app-frontend. The usage of the script is described in the README. In order for the script to work the component you wish to add must have been released by app-frontend. 2. Add an icon for the component When adding an icon there are different approaches given that;\nAny of the existing ones from Aksel Icons can be used:\nThen you simply import the icon from @studio/icons in formItemConfig.ts.\nOr, if the component needs a new custom icon:\nThen you can either create an SVG for the component yourself or outsource this task to the designers in Altinn Studio by reaching out to them in Slack or create an issue in Altinn Studio Github repository. When an SVG is created for the icon, convert the SVG to JSX, e.g. using this tool. Create a new file in libs/studio-icons/src/react/icons/[YOUR_COMPONENT_NAME]Icon.tsx and use the same format as for the other icons in the folder. The icon file must be added to the index file in the same folder.\n3. Add the new component in the list of Studio components For providing fully support for a new component in Studio, there are a few things to do. The order is arbitrary.\nAdding the new schema If you did run the script from step 1, the schema has been added for you in the correct folder. If you did not run the script, the json schema definition file must be placed in this folder: packages/ux-editor/src/testing/schemas/json/component Adding the component to the ComponentType enum, alphabetically, in this file: packages/shared/src/types/ComponentType.ts Adding the component to the components list in the file: packages/ux-editor/src/data/formItemConfig.ts by first adding it, alphabetically, to the formItemConfigs object, with the appropriate default configs and an icon, then adding it to an appropriate list in the same file; schemaComponents, advancedItems or textComponents Adding texts for the new component in nb.json: A title on the format ux_editor.component_title.[COMPONENT_TYPE] If the component has any new properties that does not exist from before, these must also be added on the format ux_editor.component_properties.[PROPERTY_NAME] If the component has any new object properties that does not exist from before, a description must also be added on the format ux_editor.component_properties_description.[PROPERTY_NAME] 4. Ensure potential other component updates are supported Check if the script updated any other component schema configs and ensure stable (unchanged?) support.\nEnsure potential new added properties exists from before, or else add necessary texts for them 5. Implement any potential custom config needed to support the component If the component has any properties that requires some special UI that is not delivered directly based on the type of the property (i.e. if it is string or an object etc.), implement support for this as a specific React component. The component can be utilized in the same way as the grid-property e.g. in FormComponentConfig.tsx.\n{grid \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Heading level={3} size=\u0026#39;xxsmall\u0026#39;\u0026gt; {t(\u0026#39;ux_editor.component_properties.grid\u0026#39;)} \u0026lt;/Heading\u0026gt; \u0026lt;EditGrid key={component.id} component={component} handleComponentChange={handleComponentUpdate} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; )} "

	"description": "Altinn Notifications provides a comprehensive address lookup service. In this article, we explain how it works, including which registries are used in different scenarios, to help you understand the process and principles of address lookup.",
	"content": "Notifications are categorized into five types based on address lookup:\nNotification to provided email or mobile number Standalone notification to national identity number Standalone notification to organization number Notification associated with a resource to national identity number Notification associated with a resource to organization number 1. Notification to provided email or mobile number For notifications sent to a specified email address or mobile number:\nThe service owner is responsible for providing accurate and verified recipient contact details. Notifications will be delivered to the specified contact points only if the details are successfully validated during the notification order process. Data Integrity The service owner is fully responsible for ensuring that all recipient contact information submitted to Altinn Notifications is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.\n2. Standalone notification to national identity number A notification sent to a national identity number without any associated resource is referred to as a standalone notification.\nAltinn Notifications utilizes the Contact and Reservation Register (KRR) to obtain the recipient\u0026rsquo;s contact details. If valid contact information is available, the system will identify an email address and/or mobile number based on the chosen notification channel.\nIf the provided national identity number is incorrect or cannot be matched:\nThe notification will not be sent. The failure will be logged with an error status, such as \u0026ldquo;recipient not identified\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;missing contact details.\u0026rdquo; Process Details Reservation against electronic communication\nEnd users can opt out of electronic communication through the Contact and Reservation Register (KRR). In such cases, their contact details will not be used unless the service owner explicitly overrides the reservation. This override is only permissible if the nature of the notification justifies it.\nWhen an end user has opted out and the service owner does not override the reservation, no contact details will be exposed or used. Instead, the lookup result will indicate the reservation status and display only the user\u0026rsquo;s national identity number.\nService owners must evaluate whether overriding the reservation is appropriate and consistent with the notification\u0026rsquo;s purpose.\nPopulating KRR End users can manage their contact details and communication preferences, including reservations against electronic communication, by accessing their profile on the KRR website.\nData Integrity During registration in the Contact and Reservation Register (KRR), basic validation ensures users provide valid mobile numbers and email addresses. Additionally, users are prompted every 90 days during login through ID-porten to confirm or update their contact details.\nContact details that have not been confirmed or updated within the last 18 months will not be included in the lookup service.\n3. Standalone notification to organization number When notifications are sent to an organization number without any associated resource, it is referred to as a standalone notification.\nAltinn uses the Notification Addresses for Businesses registry to identify the recipient\u0026rsquo;s contact details. This may include a list of email addresses and/or mobile numbers, depending on the chosen notification channel.\nIt is important to note that Altinn does not validate the accuracy of the contact details retrieved from this registry. If the provided data is inaccurate or incomplete, the notification will not be sent and will instead fail with the status \u0026ldquo;invalid contact point.\u0026rdquo;\nProcess Details Populating Notification addresses for businesses Organizations can manage their official contact details by logging into their organization\u0026rsquo;s profile in the Altinn portal.\nMultiple email addresses and mobile numbers can be registered for an organization to ensure notifications are sent to the correct contact points.\nPanel in Altinn Portal for adding official contact details Data Integrity Affiliates of the organization are responsible for keeping their contact information up-to-date to ensure notifications are received correctly. Basic validation in the Altinn portal ensures that valid mobile numbers and email addresses are provided. Additionally, contact points must be accepted by Brønnøysundregistrene before they are made available through the lookup service.\nAffiliates are prompted every 90 days to confirm or update their contact information via the Altinn portal to maintain accurate and current details.\n4. Notification associated with a resource to national identity number In this scenario, Altinn does not look up additional recipients if the recipient is a person identified by national identity number. Therefore, only their KRR contact details are relevant to retrieve.\nPlease reference Standalone notification to national identity number for relevant details.\n5. Notification associated with a resource to organization number In this scenario, Altinn uses both the Notification Addresses for Businesses registry and end users\u0026rsquo; personal contact information for enterprises to determine the addresses to notify. However, before notifications are sent, the list of recipients is filtered based on the resource\u0026rsquo;s authorization policy. Only individuals authorized to access the resource will receive a notification.\nAltinn checks authorization when the order is placed and again just before the notification is sent. This ensures that all recipients are authorized at the time the notification is actually sent, regardless of how much time has passed since the order was placed.\nProcess details Populating data sources Notification addresses to apply in public administration Please revisit the previous section covering populating Notification addresses for businesses\nPersonal contact information for enterprises Users affiliated with an organization can register their personal contact details through the organization’s profile on the Altinn portal. Each user can register one email address and one mobile number.\nPanel in Altinn Portal for adding personal contact details for an organization In addition to specifying contact information, the end user can opt to receive notifications only for specific services and/or resources.\nPanel in Altinn Portal for limiting notifications to specific services and/or resources Data Integrity Notification addresses to apply in public administration Please revisit the previous section covering data integrity of notification addresses to apply in public administration\nPersonal contact information for enterprises End users are free to input their preferred contact details, which are subject to basic validation. Affiliates of the organization are prompted every 90 days to confirm or update their contact information through the Altinn Portal.\n"

	"title": "Altinn 3 API",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "Description of different Altinn 3 APIs for both end users and application owners.",
	"content": "The APIs The Altinn 3 solution has multiple APIs, but they can be divided in two groups. The app APIs and the Platform APIs.\nApp API The application API is an API that provides access to specific instances of a specific app. The API provides features for working with data elements while keeping the metadata document for the instance and its data elements updated. The instance level endpoints revolves around moving an instance through its defined process and controlling some instance level settings.\nMetadata for an app is the second job of the app API. There are endpoints that give access to the metadata of the app itself, its data types and process description.\nEvery app will expose almost identical endpoints and functionality. External parties should need only one client implementation across all app APIs, but it is possible for the application owner to extend the app API with additional endpoints and even make changes to default functionality. Documentation for app specific API and features must be retrieved directly from the app or from the application owner.\nhttps://{org}.apps.altinn.no/{org}/{appname} The URL identifies the application owner specific hostname using the short name org, and the identifier of the app consisting of both the application owner short name and the name of the app. Combining the org and appName results in what we call the app id org/appname.\nPlatform API The Platform APIs are primarily made to support the applications hosted on the platform, but a lot of endpoints can be used directly by both application owners and users. Primarily on the Authentication, Events and Storage APIs.\nThe Storage API provides access to all instances across all applications. It can be used to access metadata about applications, instances, data elements and instance activity log (events), as well as the actual data content. This API should be the preferred method for application owners to download data associated with instances created based on their applications. Application users can use it if they need a form of message box or want to retrieve archived instances and their data.\nThe Authentication API provides methods for authentication.\nThe Events API provides access to the Events component endpoint for listing events. This can be used sporadically to query Altinn for events that have occured in the solution.\nhttps://platform.altinn.no API user groups There are primarily two groups of users of the Altinn APIs. The first group consists of applications and systems used by the owners of the Apps hosted by Altinn. This group is called Application Owners. The second group consists of organisations and people using the Apps to communicate with the application owners. This group is called Application Users.\nThe two groups have many similar needs, but there are some differences in what type of tasks they need to perform. All new APIs is technically available to both groups, but some endpoints have authorization to allow only one of the groups.\nApplication Owners Common tasks for an application owner:\nQuery instances for a given application according to status or instance owners. Create an application instance. Upload form data and attachments. Download form data. Change process state (workflow). Confirm instance as complete. Application Users Common tasks for an application user:\nQuery instances for themselves or a party they can represent (instance owner). Create an application instance. Upload form data and attachments. Download form data. Change process state (workflow). View status of an instance.

	"content": "Application B is first and foremost responsible for handling and presenting data which it retrieves from application A. Beyond this the application can act as a regular Altinn application where the final step is to submit the form, thus ending the lifecycle of the created instance. However, if there is no natural way of ending the instance of application B, this must be handled manually.\nRead the following sections for more details on:\nGetting Data From Application A Stopping an active instance Getting Data From Application A Application B needs much less configuration, as a bare minimum, at least. The main task for application B is to fetch the data received from application A and represent or process them in a way.\nIf using presentation fields or prefill, as explained in alternative 1 and 2 in the final part of app A instructions , no custom code is required.\nIf utilizing alternative 3, the data needs to be actively fetched from the instance. This is done by utilizing the ProcessDataRead method in the DataProcessor service along with the UpdateData method on the dataClient. See example code below:\npublic async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataRead(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { bool edited = false; if (data.GetType() == typeof(DataModel)) { DataModel model = (DataModel)data; DataElement data = instance.Data.FirstOrDefault(de =\u0026gt; de.DataType == [DATA_TYPE]); if (data != null) { var instanceGuid = Guid.Parse(instance.Id.Split(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;)[1]); await _dataClient.UpdateData(model, instanceGuid, typeof(DataModel), instance.Org, instance.AppId, int.Parse(instance.InstanceOwner.PartyId), Guid.Parse(instance.Data.Where(de =\u0026gt; de.DataType == [DATA_TYPE]).First().Id)); edited = true; } } return await Task.FromResult(edited); } Stopping an active instance Since this application, in most cases, will act as an on-demand dashboard for collecting data from application A, the application has no natural way of ending its process. To bypass this obstacle, the incoming forms should either:\nbe manually deleted after being read, or they must be implemented with a demand of some sort of user interaction that will trigger the process to end.

	"title": "Creating dialogs",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "How to create a dialog in Dialogporten",
	"content": "Introduction This guide shows how you can use the service owner API to create dialogs for your digital service instances and/or messages.\nWhen using Altinn Studio, dialogs will be automatically created for you. An app may opt-out of this, see the integrating Altinn Apps guide for more information. Basic steps Authenticate as a service owner Perform a POST request supplying the create dialog DTO Selecting a service resource The service resource supplied can be any resource in the Altinn Resource Registry with a hasCompententAuthority property matching the authenticated organization number.\nAdding support for additional constraints (ie. extra scope requirements) to service resources is tracked in this issue. Resource with type CorrespondenceService can not be referred, as these are reserved for use with Altinn Correspondence.\nAs with search, the serviceResource dield refer to a resource in the Resource Registry and use the format urn:altinn:resource:\u0026lt;identifier\u0026gt;.\nDates All date fields are optional, but may be supplied in order to keep timestamps synchronized between Dialogporten and the service platform, control dialog visibility and indicate a due date.\nCreated and updated dates By default, both these will be set to the current timestamp when creating a dialog. Either of these may be supplied, but updated date must not be earlier than created date.\nVisibility dates There a two optional dates that may be set on a dialog that controls visibility for end-users.\nexpiresAt defines a future timestamp that when reached, renders the dialog inaccessible in the end-user API. End-user-systems should make an effort to warn users that the content is about to be inaccessible. Inaccessible dialogs are still visible in the service owner APIs, except when impersonating a user, and the expiresAt field may at any point be set to null or a future value which will render it visible for the end-user again (and a dialogporten.dialog.updated event will be emitted). Inaccessible dialogs will at this time not be sanized from the database, but this may change in the future where Dialogporten remove long since expired dialogs for privacy and system efficiency reasons. visibleFrom defines a future timestamp that when reached, renders the dialog accessible in the end-user API. Prior to this time, the dialog will not be accessible. Due to a known limitation, events associated with dialog creates/updates will not consider visibleFrom. This means that whenever a dialog is created with a future visibleFrom date, the event will be produced immediately, but will not allow the end-user to access the dialog. Supplying a due date The ´dueAt´ timestamp is a hint to end-user systems to indicate to the users that a due date is associated with the dialog. Passing the due date has no effect on dialog availability.\nSetting content Dialogporten supports several content-fields used for different purposes. These can be set on both dialog and transmissions. For techical information about field names, allowed formats etc. see the content-type reference.\nTitle The title is the main headline for the dialog. For dialogs referring to resources requiring the highest level of authentication (security level), a alternative non-sensitive title may additionally be supplied, which will be used as the title if the current user has authenticated with a method with a security level lower than the resource policy demands.\nSummary The summary should provide the user with a quick overview of the current state of the dialog. This is available in the search/list API, and is usually displayed immediately after the title. For dialogs referring to resources requiring the highest level of authentication (security level), a alternative non-sensitive summary may additionally be supplied, which will be used as the summary if the current user has authenticated with a method with a security level lower than the resource policy demands.\nAdditional info The additional info field should not be used for personalized content data, but show additional non-personal information relevant to the dialog and/or current process state. Examples are contact information and links to additional documentation or support sites. This field supports rich formatting via CommonMark markdown.\nSender name Usually, end-user systems utilize the org field to indicate to the end-user who the other party of the dialog is. This can be augmented/overridden by supplying the senderName field, which end-user systems should use instead of (or in addition to) org to indicate to the end-user who the other party of the dialog is.\nExtended status extendedStatus is a structured field that service owners can set on the dialog, allowing for service/domain-specific statuses beyond the generic states defined by status. The extended status content type is the human readable counter part, and should be supplied by the service owner whenever a structured extendedStatus is set.\nContent reference This is the content type for front channel embeds, and can be set on both dialogs and transmissions within dialogs.\nRead more\nReference information on the dialog and transmission content types Reference information about front channel embeds Supplying search tags As Dialogporten does not contain any content data, free text search is inherently limited to content fields. Not all relevant search terms is suitable for title/summary fields, so instead the service owner can supply an array of search tags that also will be considered when using free text search. The search tags are not visible on any end-user APIs.\nSetting a status Dialogporten supports several generic dialog statuses, that indicate various typical states of the process the dialog represents. These statuses should be used by end-user systems to organize and prioritize the dialog list. The statuses are:\nStatus Descrption NotApplicable The dialogue does not have any meaningful status. Typically used for simple messages that do not require any interaction. This is the default. Draft Used to indicate user-initiated dialogs not yet sent and that may be cancelled at any point. InProgress Indicates that the dialog is started, is being worked on by the party and/or service owner. In a serial process, this might indicate that, for example, a form filling is ongoing on a pre-filled form. Awaiting Sent by the party to the service owner and is awaiting a response. In a serial process, this is used after a submission is made. RequiresAttention Used to indicate that the dialogue is in progress/under work, but is in a state where the user must do something - for example, correct an error, or other conditions that hinder further processing. Completed The dialogue was completed. This typically means that the dialogue has reached and end-state where no further updates will be made. What statuses to use when When creating dialogs, the service platform should consider both the state and circumstances of the dialog being created. There are no set rules, but the following guidelines can help with deciding on what status is appropiate.\nDoes the dialog represent an application form, that was \u0026ldquo;cold\u0026rdquo; initiated by the user without any obvious interaction with the service owner? Draft Is the dialog initated by the service owner (optionally pre-filled with data) for a reporting form? InProgress Is the dialog in state where the user has made an submission, and awaiting some sort of feedback from the service owner, ie \u0026ldquo;the ball is in the service owners court\u0026rdquo;? Awaiting Was the dialog previously in a Draft state, but was there at some point obvious interaction with the service owner, ie. initial feedback/validation was requested and given, placing the \u0026ldquo;ball back in the partys court\u0026rdquo;? InProgress Was there some sort of discrepancy, error condidtion, important due date approaching or similar requiring the user to take action in order for the process to proceed? RequiresAttention Did the dialog reach a logical conclusion, ie. an official decision was made which in normal circumstances (ie. not counting appeal processes) representes the end of the dialog? Completed A particular dialog may demand a higher resolution of statuses, ie. having several distinct states of \u0026ldquo;InProgress\u0026rdquo; that is meaningfull to onvey to the end-user. For these purposes, see the extendedStatus property and content type.\nDefining actions Actions are not mandatory, but most dialogs should indicate how the user is expected to interact in order, so unless there are particular reasons not to, consider adding at least one GUI-action.\nAuthorizing actions Actions have themselves an action property that corresponds to a XACML action defined in the referred service resource\u0026rsquo;s policy. Dialogporten will check if the authenticated user is allowed to perform the specified action on the referred service resource for the dialog\u0026rsquo;s party, and if not, will flag the action as isAuthorized: false and remove the supplied URL. End-user systems should indicate to the end-user that the action exists, but that access is missing - and if possible, provide information on how to request access (which is out of scope for Dialogporten).\nWhile Dialogporten will check authorization for the action and remove the URL if the check fails, the service owner system MUST perform its own authorization based on the same policy For added control, an authorization attribute can be supplied, which allows service owners to refer to specific rules within the policy or other service resources (which the service owner controls) entirely.\nDefining GUI actions For many dialogs, a single GUI action with a title with something like \u0026ldquo;Start form filling\u0026rdquo; and a simple URL causing a GET navigation to the service implementation will suffice. The service owner system should make sure to include sufficient information in the URL in order to initiate, authenticate and authorize the request. As the Dialogporten end-user API requires ID-porten authentication, the service owner system can usually rely on an SSO (single-sign-on) session being active in ID-porten, thus providing a seamless user experience (barring a few browser redirects).\nWrite actions If the httpMethod supplied for a GUI action is any other than GET, it is considered a write action, and the browser based end-user system must use Fetch API or similar to construct the request using the browsers scripting capabilities. As this makes GET-based redirected SSO with ID-porten impossible, in order for the service owner to be able to initiate a session, the end-user system will include the dialog token as a Authorization-header. The service owner system at the URL will also have to fully support the CORS-protocol.\nDelete actions Depending on the state and nature of the dialog, a delete-action should also be supplied. Delete actions is a special write action that should be flagged with the isDeleteAction-flag, which will give an important hint to the end-user system for providing appropiate GUI.\nDefining API actions In order to support automations via custom end-user systems not constrained by browser semantics and security measures, service owner systems should consider adding API actions. These are typically ignored by generic browser based portal systems aimed at human users, but can provide useful information to custom end-user systems about the shape of the service owner system APIs, and what endpoints/resources/actions are relevant for the given state of the dialog - ie. a form of dynamic documentation. Eg. a form filling service might provide a POST endpoint expecting a particular datamodel representing all the form information, mirroring the human-focused GUI-action \u0026ldquo;Go to form filling\u0026rdquo;.\nNote that Dialogporten will not consider the validity or semantics of API actions, but will - as with GUI actions - perform authorization and flag isAuthorized accordingly.\nRead more\nLearn more about actions in dialogs Reference information about the actions entities Learn how write actions are used to provide a more integrated user experience Learn how dialog tokens can be used to simplify authorization and enable higher confidentiality Defining attachments A logical attachment can have several representations aimed at both human users (typically unstructured data such as PDFs, media content etc) and for system/machines (typically structured data such as JSON or XML). Eg. a given attachment can be made available in PDF, DOCX, XML and JSON formats, which all contain the same logical content but in different formats. An attachment can also be indicated as a HTML (mediaType text/html), which should cause a normal browser navigation. End-user systems can provide embedded experiences for supported media types, eg. provide viewers/players for image and video attachments.\nAttachments can be defined on both the dialog and on individual transmissions.\nRead more\nLearn more about attachments in dialogs Defining transmissions Transmissions may contain an additional level content and attachments that represent a single instance of communication within a dialog, which can be subject to different authorization rules than the dialog level content. The transmission thus contains\ninformation of who sent it; either a representative of the party or the service owner the type of transmission, which should give end user systems an idea on how to appropiately display it to end-users. A service specific, structured extended type can also be supplied that custom end-users systems can utilize. optionally another related transmission As with dialog level content, transmissions might contain a title, summary and a content reference (front channel embed). Service owners might use front channel embeds to track whether or not a particular transmission has been opened, which again can eg. trigger a transmissionOpened activity being added.\nThis section is incomplete While we're working on it, contributions are also very welcome.

A typical starting point is to add a DialogCreated activity.\nThis section is incomplete While we're working on it, contributions are also very welcome. Hit \"Edit this page on GitHub\" on the bottom of this page to get started. Read more\nLearn about how Dialogporten provides a activity log for each dialog Refererence information about the dialog activity entity Ensuring idempotency Dialogporten offers two optional mechanisms to ensure that both dialogs and transmissions are only created once:\nUser-supplied dialog and transmission IDs. Service owner systems can define their own UUIDv7s (which might be deterministically derived from internal identifiers) A dedicated idempotency key The first option is a simple mechanism which for most service owner systems might be sufficient, while the other can more easily used to implement arbitrary business rules (eg. any given dialog should be associated with only one tuple of reporting party, reporting service and year/month).\nFor information on how to use HTTP-based concurrency control via ETag / If-Match-headers, see the guide for updating dialogs. Silent dialog creation In some cases, typically in historical data migration scenarious, it is desirable to perform a non-business-process related update to a dialog. These updates work exactly like normal updates, but\nDoes not bump updatedAt or contentUpdatedAt Does not cause Altinn Events to be produced This behaviour can be enabled by added the query parameter ?isSilentUpdate=true to the URL for the POST/PUT/PATCH request.\nRead more\nHow to update a dialog in Dialogporten Links to OpenAPI specifications for Dialogporten How to use the .NET API client for service owners "

	"description": "Migration of Correspondence Data for Altinn Correspondence",
	"content": "The \u0026ldquo;Flytt av Data\u0026rdquo; project will take responsibility for migrating all historical correspondences and attachments to the new solution.\nAn automated job migrates correspondences and associated attachments from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3 using a dedicated API endpoint. The migrated version of an element will have a reference to its old Altinn 2 version, exposed in the field: \u0026ldquo;Altinn2CorrespondenceId\u0026rdquo; in the CorrespondenceOverview endpoint. After migration, the elements will still be available in Altinn 2, both in the Portal and via API. After migration, changes to the element will be synchronized both ways, between the Altinn 2 and Altinn 3 versions of the element. The Altinn 3 version of the migrated element will, once migration is complete, have an \u0026ldquo;IsMigrating\u0026rdquo; flag that keeps it hidden from regular API calls. When the flag \u0026ldquo;IsMigrating\u0026rdquo; is removed, the migrated message will become available in the same manner as other Altinn 3 Correspondences. Altinn 3 Correspondence API. Can be created in Dialogporten and thus accessed in Arbeidsflate. The Altinn 3 version of the message will not be available in Altinn 2 Portal, which will continue to show the Altinn 2 version of the message. No data is deleted as a result of migration; the correspondences are only flagged in the database, and it is possible to perform the migration again and/or manually retrieve data if needed. The migration will take place over time, and can be configured to re-migrate messages.\nVolume and Migration Rate It is estimated that over 500 million correspondences with attachments will be migrated from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3. Therefore, it is planned to perform the migration gently, starting with smaller volumes over time to gather experience and avoid disrupting the environments.\nOver time, the rate will increase and eventually be almost up to date with live traffic in Altinn 2 as it slowly decreases and Altinn 2 is phased out.\nMigration Criteria The migration component will extract a certain number of elements per run for all services, sorted by the oldest message first.\nDetailed Migration Process per Element The migration process per correspondence will be divided into several steps to reduce risk and can be controlled per correspondence, with the ability to delete data and restart the process. No data is deleted from Altinn 2.\nMigration of message data and attachments from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3, where we are not dependent on service configuration. Migration of necessary service configuration and access rules. Migration of associated instance and service delegations. Creation of the migrated message in the Dialog Portal/Unified Workspace. Initially, steps 1, 2, and 3 will be triggered manually as separate actions by the Move Data team, and step 4 will be triggered by the Dialog Portal/Unified Workspace.\nEventually, as full production for all components approaches, this will be handled automatically in a single process for new messages.\nWhat Data is Migrated? Only correspondences that have not been permanently deleted are migrated, including correspondences in the recycle/trash bin. No correspondences for dead people. Both non-archived and archived correspondences. Correspondence content, including text and all attachments and metadata. A limited form of notification history: Time and recipient address, but not text content. Change history; including opening, read confirmation, and information about forwarding and instance delegation. Altinn 2 CorrespondenceId and NotificationId, making it possible to look up in Altinn 2 in cases where more detailed investigations are needed. Synchronization of Status Changes between Altinn 2 and 3 There will be two-way synchronization of status changes and events on messages between Altinn 2 and Altinn 3 after migration is completed.\nThis solution will be referred to as \u0026ldquo;CorrespondenceSync\u0026rdquo;.\nExisting status/history will be migrated in step 1 but will be continuously synchronized as changes occur.\nBecause there are some differences and technical limitations, synchronization consists of the following events:\nEvents synchronized both ways Opened / read Confirmed Permanent deletion Events synchronized only from Altinn 2 to 3 Archiving Move to trash / remove from trash Notification sent Forwarding Technical Implementation A dedicated endpoint is created in Altinn 3 Correspondence that only provides access to the Migration component; MigrationController. An Altinn 2 AltinnBatch-based migration component \u0026ldquo;MigrateCorrespondence\u0026rdquo; is created Consumes the migration endpoint. Uses configuration in the Altinn 2 database to control migration. Can be triggered manually with parameters, but will over time run more or less continuously. A synchronization job \u0026ldquo;AltinnCorrespondenceSync\u0026rdquo; is created to synchronize status events for messages from Altinn 2 to 3. It calls dedicated sync endpoints in the Altinn 3 Correspondence API. In Altinn 3 Correspondence, the handlers for \u0026ldquo;Read\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Confirmed\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Purged\u0026rdquo; are extended These call dedicated \u0026ldquo;Sync\u0026rdquo; endpoints in the Altinn 2 SBLBridge API.

	"description": "Reference information about dialog tokens",
	"content": "Introduction See getting started with dialog tokens for a functional overview of dialog tokens and what they can be used for.\nDialog tokens allows for unproxied frontend requests to endpoints requiring authentication and authorization, without having to rely on ID-porten SSO and redirects.\nUsage for end-user systems (OAuth clients) Dialog tokens are embedded withing the single dialog response model (see dialogToken), and is a self-contained, signed JWT containing claims from the authenticated user and the dialog itself, including what actions and authorization attributes the user is authorized for.\nThe dialog tokens should be transferred as-is as a bearer token in a Authorization HTTP header. The contents of the dialog token should normally not be considered by the clients, ie. the token should be treated as an opaque string.\nThe altinn.no-portal will be using dialog tokens on all URLs associated with write actions and front channel embeds. Other end user systems might also use the dialog token for API actions, subject to service specific protocols defined by the respective service owner.\nDialog token lifetime A fresh dialog token is issued for each fetch of the dialog aggregate. The lifetime (exp claim) is 10 minutes, so end-user systems should refetch the dialog to ensure that the endpoints accept the token, and that it matches current authorization data.\nReceving and verifying dialog tokens (OAuth resource servers) The resource server will with the help of dialog tokens be able to fully authenticate and authorize requests that are otherwise unauthenticated (ie. without cookies or any other state). The dialog tokens should be transferred as a bearer token using a Authorization HTTP header.\nNote that for clients that are browser-based, including the Altinn.no-portal, the resource server will also have to implement the CORS-protocol in order to handle requests\nList of Dialogporten specific claims Claim Description Example c Authenticated as a consumer of Dialogporten.

Consult the OpenAPI specification (tag \u0026ldquo;Metadata\u0026rdquo;) for the well-known URLs for the given environment.\nKey sets and rotations The JSON Web Key sets published on the well-known-endpoints will always contain at least two JWKs. All endpoints that accepts and verifies dialog tokens issued by Dialogporten, should allow tokens signed by any of the keys present in the key set for the given environment.\nThe key set should be cached and refreshed with a frequency no more than 24 hours. Dialogporten may at any point introduce new keys into the key set, but will not sign any dialog tokens until the key has been published and available at the well-known endpoint for at least 48 hours. This will allow for consumers to refresh their caches and verify the signature of any token issued by Dialogporten.\nToken validation recommendations Please consult RFC 8725 and the aforementioned RFCs for information about best practices for JWS signature validation.\n"

	"content": "Design goals Altinn Events was developed to make it easier for service developers to deliver dynamic and seamless user experiences, based on data from multiple systems.\nAltinn Events provides developers a simple route to adding event-driven architecture to their existing service-oriented applications. Secure and scalable, Altinn Events uses Publish/Subscribe concepts to loosely couple disparate systems without relying on polling or database replication.\nMain benefits Reasons to consider using Altinn Events\nFor event publishers\nSimple HTTP interface to publish events to, as they occur. Security, scalability, reliability and auditing built-in. Altinn authorization services available for managing access to events for subscribers. For event subscribers\nNo need to continuously poll for updates. Simple API for creating and managing event subscriptions, including support for attribute-based filtering. Reliable delivery with automatic retry logic means events will be buffered for you in case your webhook is unavailable for a period of time. Built-in authorization policy execution ensures that your app won\u0026rsquo;t receive irrelevant notifications. Pub/Sub vs Event streaming There are two main event driven architecture models: Pub/Sub and Event streaming\nAltinn Events is based on the Pub/Sub model which has simpler delivery constraints than event streaming. In particular, Altinn Events does not guarantee in-order delivery, nor exactly once delivery.\nConsequentially, developers should make every effort to process events idempotently and anticipate the possibility of out-of-order message delivery.\nLimitations Intermittently, Altinn Apps using the opt-in events feature may fail to produce events as expected. There are mitigating measures in place, and events affected by this issue may experience a delay of several hours. See the above on pub/sub about out-of-order deliveries. Work is in progress to address this/reduce the delay. Events are not guaranteed to be delivered. Push-events have a fixed schedule for delivery-attempts and backoff-timings, before entering a \u0026ldquo;dead letter\u0026rdquo; state (see retry-schedule).\nEvents expire after 90 days regardless of delivery status (see publish events).\nTerminology What is an event? An event is a lightweight notification message containing information about a single operation or state change for a specified entity. Each event is published by a single originator, referred to as the event publisher or source, on behalf of a single person, organization or asset, known as the subject. The operation or state change is referred to as the event type.\nTechnically, events are JSON documents conforming to the Cloud Event v1.0.2 specification. This specification defines a standard set of property names, accepted value formats and a mechanism for encapsulating additional message payload, such as XML or binary encoded data.\nHere is an example of a typical event:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;eae8d8a7-4659-43c0-83cd-42f673eff8cf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://someservice.com/rest/path/object-id-1234\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;specversion\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;app.instance.created\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subject\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;/party/50019855\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;time\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2022-05-12T00:02:07.541482Z\u0026#34; } Here is an example of an event publish through Altinn:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;eae8d8a7-4659-43c0-83cd-42f673eff8cf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://someservice.com/rest/path/object-id-1234\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;specversion\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;app.instance.created\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resource\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource:someservice.resource\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resourceinstance\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;object-id-1234\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subject\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;/party/50019855\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;time\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2022-05-12T00:02:07.541482Z\u0026#34; } Note the new properties resource and resourceinstance.\nIn addition to adhering to the specification, cloud events published through Altinn Events must include a set of Altinn specific extension attributes used to enable authorization of events and support easier filtering of events for subscribers.\nWhat is a subscription? Altinn Events allows you to register a custom webhook for receiving events. You can define various filters, including by source, type and resource.\nFor security reasons, the webhook endpoint must support HTTPS.\nBefore enabling event forwarding for a new subscription, Altinn Events sends a custom event to the provided webhook URL to ensure that it exists.\nFor more information, please see this developer guide\nA note about standards Why Cloud Events? Basing our API on the Cloud Event standard ensures consistent support across programming languages, operating systems and network stacks. This same standard has been adopted by many cloud providers and a growing number of independent solution providers.\nThe official specification defines a scaleable approach to versioning and extensions, opening possibilities for future capabilities in a backwards compatible fashion.\nWho can use Altinn Events? Publishing of app events is limited to Altinn apps created and deployed with altinn.studio. Generic, or non-app events can be published by an application owner system. The event produsing system must be registered as a resource in the resource registry.\nSubscribing to events is openly available to end users, end user systems and application owners. Once additional parties gain access to publishing, the right to subscribe to events published through Altinn will be generally available to the public.*\nSubscriptions will need to be authorized by the publisher, and Altinn\u0026rsquo;s terms and conditions will have to be signed before gaining access.\nAltinn Events APIAn overview of the Altinn Events API\nPublish eventsDocumentation for event publishers\nQuery eventsDocumentation for querying events from API\nSubscribe to eventsDocumentation for event subscribers\nReferenceReference documentation for Altinn Events\nExplanationUnderlying concepts or principle explained\n"

Unfortunately, there is no resource group where alerts can be persisted for application owners. We know this is a feature many application owners are requesting, and the Altinn team is working hard on making this available for you.\nVis/skjul innhold What does Altinn monitor on our behalf? The Altinn team has access to all of the telemetry logged by the application that the app owners also have access to. In addition we monitor the infrastructure components for each application owner such as Kubernetes cluster, storage account and key vault.\nAs a main rule the Altinn team has action plans for alerts related to the infrastructure that is required to run the apps i.e CPU exhaustion in the application cluster or a pod is in an error state in the cluster. Altinn does not actively monitor the performance or failure rates of individual applications.\nVis/skjul innhold What are the top three most useful features in AI? Frequently used AI features marked in menu Failures: get an overview over all failing requests within a time frame and drill into the stack trace to investigate which request in the call chain produces the error response Performance: get an overview over all requests withing a time frame. Identify slowest requests and drill into stack trace to investigate which part of the call chain is harming the request performance. Logs: query log and trace data to find exception messages or identify custom telemetry related to a specific request Vis/skjul innhold How can I see who performed the request? The application template logs identity telemetry whenever this information is available to the app. Data points include authentication level (authLevel), partyId, userId and organisation number (orgNumber).\nExample of custom dimensions To present the custom telemetry data when querying the logs use the property customDimensions. Here is an example of how to list all requests presented by their request url and userId that performed the requests\nrequests | project url, customDimensions[\u0026#34;userId\u0026#34;] Vis/skjul innhold We have many apps in my organisation, but I am only interested in one of them All logs and dashboard in AI can include filters. Use a role filter to filter out data related to your application. The role (or cloud role name) for your application is equal to your application name (i.e. the repository name in Altinn Studio).\nFilter icon and role selection marked When working with the user interface look for the filter icon (1) and add or adjust the role filter (2).\nIf working with logs the following where clause is used to filter out the data for your app.\nwhere cloud_RoleName == \u0026lt;insert app name\u0026gt; To retrieve all request for the application bli-tjenesteeier the query would look like this\nrequests | where cloud_RoleName == \u0026#34;bli-tjenesteeier\u0026#34; Vis/skjul innhold An end user is reporting that their experiencing an error When end users report errors this could be an error that affects all users and it is easy to identify the failing request in the failure tab. However, if the error is affecting a single or very few users the instanceId can be a helpful tool.\nEnd users should always include the instanceGuid or archive reference (last 12 chars of an instance guid). This GUID can be included in a filter on the Performance page to get an overview over all incoming requests related to the instance, maybe this can give a clear picture of what has happened.\nAlternatively, you can query the log tool for actions related to the instance.\nrequests | where url contains \u0026#34;165dc739-0f55-4a4c-9b0b-781340a68cd8\u0026#34; | order by timestamp desc Vis/skjul innhold My application shows Ukjent feil... \u0026hellip; but I don\u0026rsquo;t know what is causing it.\nUkjent feil in the application is caused by the application returning an unexpected response during a request from the client (app frontend). To investigate situations like these starting in the Failures tab is often the way to go.\nSteps marked for drill down on failures page Based on the scenario when things fail you might be able to identify the correct request in the operation overview. Highlight this request. In the summary section you will see top three response codes and exception types related to the failing request. If further investigation is required you may drill into the request samples. Instances of the request are listed and you may sort them based on relevance or date. Click one of the requests to be forwarded to the end-to-end transaction details. End-to-end transaction details Looking through the transactions all requests with a non-successful response code will be marked in red. To see addition details for a specific request highlight it and review the blade on the right hand side of the screen.\nVis/skjul innhold How can I identify what is causing a request to be slow? Use the Performance page to investigate slow requests\nSteps marked for drill down on performance page Identify the request you are interested in Click the Drill into x samples button Select one of the requests in the list to be shown the end-to-end transaction details.

Application with a process containing a exclusive gateway Controlling flow out of a gateway based on data provided by the user using expressions It is possible to control what flow is chosen out of a gateway based on data that was provided by a user in a previous task using the same expression language used to hide/show elements in the UI. To accomplish this we first need to define what formdata should be provided as context to the expression.\nExample:\n... \u0026lt;bpmn:exclusiveGateway id=\u0026#34;Gateway_1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_t1_g1\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_g1_t2\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;Flow_g1_end\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:gatewayExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:connectedDataTypeId\u0026gt;Schema\u0026lt;/altinn:connectedDataTypeId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:gatewayExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:exclusiveGateway\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:sequenceFlow id=\u0026#34;Flow_g1_t2\u0026#34; sourceRef=\u0026#34;Gateway_1\u0026#34; targetRef=\u0026#34;Task_2\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:sequenceFlow id=\u0026#34;Flow_g1_end\u0026#34; sourceRef=\u0026#34;Gateway_1\u0026#34; targetRef=\u0026#34;EndEvent\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; ... In the example above the gateway is adding the formdata stored in the datatype Schema as context to the expressions. Form data and dataTypes are defined in the applicaitonmetadata.json file.\nOnce the gateway is connected to a datatype we can leverage the expressions language to define if flows leading out of the gateway are available.\nNOTE: There need to be only one flow available after filtering out flows, unless there is a default flow and it is part of the possible flows out of the gateway\nWe now need to define these expressions in the outgoing flows from the gateway. In the example gateway we have two outgoing flows: Flow_g1_t2 and Flow_g1_end\nWe want to send the process to follow the Flow_g1_t2 if the field Amount in the formdata is greater than or equal to 1000 or Flow_g1_end if it is below 1000\nTo achive this we need to add conditionExpressions to the outgoing flows\n\u0026lt;bpmn:sequenceFlow id=\u0026#34;Flow_g1_t2\u0026#34; sourceRef=\u0026#34;Gateway_1\u0026#34; targetRef=\u0026#34;Task_2\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:conditionExpression\u0026gt;[\u0026#34;greaterThanEq\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Amount\u0026#34;], 1000]\u0026lt;/bpmn:conditionExpression\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:sequenceFlow\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:sequenceFlow id=\u0026#34;Flow_g1_end\u0026#34; sourceRef=\u0026#34;Gateway_1\u0026#34; targetRef=\u0026#34;EndEvent\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:conditionExpression\u0026gt;[\u0026#34;lessThan\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Amount\u0026#34;], 1000]\u0026lt;/bpmn:conditionExpression\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:sequenceFlow\u0026gt; If the user has submitted a Amount of 1000 the expressions in sequenceFlow Flow_g1_end evaluates to false and the flow is removed from the possible flows to choose and the only available flow is Flow_g1_t2 and therefor it is chosen.\nTo see more possibilities with expressions see Expressions\nControlling flow out of a gateway base on user action performed using expressions In addition to using the expressions against the datamodel it is also possible in a process conditionExpression to make decisions based on the action taken by the user/system in the task before the gateway.\nIf an applications process has a confirmation step where it is possible to reject the data and send the instance back to the previous step (Task_1) if the end user performs the reject action\n\u0026lt;bpmn:task id=\u0026#34;Task_2\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;Person\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_t1_t2\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;Flow_t2_g1\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskType\u0026gt;confirmation\u0026lt;/altinn:taskType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action\u0026gt;confirm\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action\u0026gt;reject\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:task\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:exclusiveGateway id=\u0026#34;Gateway_1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_t2_g1\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_g1_t1\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;Flow_g1_end\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:exclusiveGateway\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:sequenceFlow id=\u0026#34;Flow_g1_t1\u0026#34; sourceRef=\u0026#34;Gateway_1\u0026#34; targetRef=\u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:sequenceFlow id=\u0026#34;Flow_g1_end\u0026#34; sourceRef=\u0026#34;Gateway_1\u0026#34; targetRef=\u0026#34;EndEvent\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; In the example above there is defined two actions in Task_2 confirm and reject.

	"description": "Guidelines should ensure common language and understandability across services in Altinn.",
	"content": "Usually you should use guidelines from the norwegian language council (nb/nn) while writing. We have also defined some more specific rules for Altinn which we recommend following.\nWe encourage writing form content in both bokmål, nynorsk and english.\nGeneral recommendations Write in a spoken and simple language Write directly to the user (use \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo;) Explain the next step Write short, clearly and clickable Write skimmable texts Be specific about the content, but make sure to write it in a way so that everyone understands. Avoid: Long words Long sentences Cryptic or lyrical labels Multiple points in the same sentence Multiple points in the same paragraph CAPITALS (big letters) Length of text: Headlines/Labels: max. 8 words setninger: 15-20 words paragraps: 40-80 words Write with purpose Formal language is often put together in a way where the statement (verb) comes at the end of the sentence. This means that the user has to read and remember many words before the actual content is reached. This demands more attention of the user, which has to process more information to read the sentence. The verb should be as early as possible in the sentence, and as close to the subject as possible.\nExample:\nThe employer has some duties that must be completed →\nThe employer must complete some duties\nAvoid verbal nouns Verbal nouns make the text unnecessary difficult to read. A verbal noun is a noun created from a verb, for example \u0026ldquo;to investigate\u0026rdquo; becomes \u0026ldquo;to do an investigation\u0026rdquo;, where investigation is the verbal noun. Most verbal nouns end with \u0026ldquo;-ion\u0026rdquo;.\nA text with many verbal nouns often becomes abstract because it removes itself from the actions they really describe. The text becomes more concrete when we use the verbs instead.\nExamples:\nNew inquiry → Inquire Registration of error → Register error Write actively, not passively: In legal language it is often written that something has to be done and that it isn\u0026rsquo;t desired to say who should do it. In Altinn\u0026rsquo;s solutions there are often multiple people who have to do something, but we can directly address the user.\nExample:\nPreparations and planning activities must be done ahead of development of a service. →\nMake preparations and plan well before you start developing your service.\nSeparation of numbers Correct and consequent separation of numbers assist the user in reading and separating different types of numbers. None of the numbers should be seperated by a comma, only by spaces. In fields where the user will write longer numbers, it is useful to indicate the number of digits.\nOrganisation numbers are seperated in groups of 3: 123 456 789 Bank account numbers are seperated into 4, 2 and 5: 1234 56 78901 SSN should be divided into 6 and 5: 123456 78901 Mobile numbers should be divided into 3, 2 and 3: 987 65 432 Land lines and fax is divided into groups of 2: 98 76 54 32 Time and date Time is only written with hours and minutes, never seconds. Time is written like this: 13:45 Dates should mainly be written like this: 05.06.2017 Sometimes dates can be written in text: 5. juni 2017 "

You can edit the field names to make it clear what they represent, and add your own fields.\nThe data model is used to determine what data to collect. It is also used to determine how the data should look/be, by setting constraints that are validated.\nNavigate to the \u0026ldquo;Data Model\u0026rdquo; page by clicking on \u0026ldquo;Data Model\u0026rdquo; in the top menu bar. You will then see the data model with the fields that have been added. Click on the first field in the data model, property1. A number of editing options will appear in the right panel. Change the name of the field property1 to first name. Select the field property2, and change the name of the field to last name. Select the field property3, and change the name of the field to middle name. Note that the middle name field is not set as required, as the \u0026ldquo;Required\u0026rdquo; option is turned off. Click on the fields first name and last name and see that these fields are set as required. You can keep these settings as they are. Click the \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; button next to model at the top of the data model and select \u0026ldquo;Integer\u0026rdquo;. See that a new field named \u0026ldquo;name0\u0026rdquo; and type \u0026ldquo;Integer\u0026rdquo; has been added to the bottom of the data model. Change the name of the integer field to age. Further down in the \u0026ldquo;Properties\u0026rdquo; panel on the right side, there is a field called \u0026ldquo;Less than or equal\u0026rdquo;. Enter the number 120 in this field. Click the \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; button next to model at the top of the data model and select \u0026ldquo;Object\u0026rdquo;. See that a new field named \u0026ldquo;name0\u0026rdquo; and type \u0026ldquo;Object\u0026rdquo; has been added to the bottom of the data model. Change the name of the object field to address. Click on the address field in the data model. Notice that the arrow now points down, and a group opens under the field with the message This element is empty. Hover over the address field. You will see 3 buttons next to the field. Click the + sign and then \u0026ldquo;Add field\u0026rdquo; in the menu list to add a new field to the group. Click on the new field that was added to the group and change the name of the field to street address. Hover over the address group again, click the + sign, and \u0026ldquo;Add field\u0026rdquo; to add another field to the group. Name the field postal code. The field automatically gets the type \u0026ldquo;Text\u0026rdquo; and can keep that type. Add another new field to the address group and name the field city. The field automatically gets the type \u0026ldquo;Text\u0026rdquo; and can keep that type. Go back to the top of the data model and add a new group named contact info. Click the \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; button next to model at the top of the data model and select \u0026ldquo;Object\u0026rdquo;. Add a field to the contact info group and name the field email. Add another field to the contact info group and name the field phone. All fields from the requirements list are now added. Click the \u0026ldquo;Generate models\u0026rdquo; button to create all necessary model files for the service. Once this is completed, you will see a green box with a confirmation message at the top of the page.

This will update the status of the File Transfer, and potentially delete the file data according to the settings on the Broker Resource.\nEndpoint: POST /broker/api/v1/filetransfer/{fileTransferId}/confirmdownload\nUpload the file data as a stream using the FileTransferId received in InitializeFileTransfer.\nRequest: FileTransferID specified in url.\nReturn: HTTP 200 if successfully completed.\nEvents triggered:\ndownloadconfirmed. Example: \u0026lsquo;File Transfer{fileTransferId}\\Confirm download\u0026rsquo; in our Bruno collection.\nEvent: no.altinn.broker.published This event is triggered when when the async uploadprocessing step has completed successfully.\nAs a recipient you can then use the FileTransferId specified in the resourceinstance to start downloading the metadata and file data.\nEvent: no.altinn.broker.downloadconfirmed This event is triggered when you have confirmed the download has completed successfully, and it is also sent to the Sender. You do not need to perform actions against Broker, but it is an additional confirmation that the ConfirmDownload has gone successfully, and you may chose to use this to trigger some internal process on your end.\nEvent: no.altinn.broker.fileneverconfirmeddownloaded This event is triggered on the ExpiryTime of the FileTransfer in the case that one or more recipients have not confirmed the download of the file. This may indicate that either the recipient has been unaware of the FileTransfer or that they have downloaded but neglected to call the ConfirmDownload. This event is also sent to the Recipient(s) that have not confirmed the download.\n"

	"content": " Select environment: Production Staging (TT02) Dev Local dev Help This dropdown lets you select which Dialogporten environment the content of this page should be based on. If unsure, use the default \"Staging (TT02)\", as this is the environment you would normally test against when integrating Dialogporten. For bleeding edge, select \"Dev\", as this contains the most recent unreleased changes to the Dialogporten API. Select \"Local dev\" if you want to test changes to Dialogporten itself running locally. Dismiss Introduction This guide shows how a end-user system can search for dialogs in Dialogporten using either REST or GraphQL APIs. Dialogporten supports a number of parameters for filtering, sorting and free-text searching.\nNote that the data structure that is returned in searches differ from the one returned on the details endpoint; more information about the dialog and what access the authorized user has to various parts of it is only available in the details view.\nBasic steps (REST) Authenticate as a end-user Find the parties that the authenticated end-user is authorized to represent Perform a GET request to /api/v1/enduser/dialogs, supplying query parameters according to the table below: All parameters of different types are AND-ed, ie. if supplying party and status, only the dialogs of the provided status owned by the provided party will be returned. When supporting multiple values for the same parameter, these values are OR-ed, ie. if supplying two status parameters, dialogs having either of those values will be returned. org parameters must be service owner codes as defined in the global altinn-orgs.json, eg. digdir or skd. party parameters must have one of the following formats urn:altinn:person:identifier-no:\u0026lt;11 digit national identity numner\u0026gt; urn:altinn:organization:identifier-no:\u0026lt;9 digit CCR number\u0026gt; serviceResource parameters must refer to a resource in the Resource Registry and use the following format: urn:altinn:resource:\u0026lt;identifier\u0026gt; Note the end-user search API requires that at least one serviceResource or party parameter is supplied. Up to 20 distinct values for each of these two types may be supplied. Returned information This will return a collection of dialogs, which contains a subset of the information returned on the dialog details endpoint. Depending on search parameters and the access of the authenticated user, this list may be empty.\nIf any invalid search parameters are supplied, the API will return 400 Bad Request and a response explaining what errors were encountered. This response follows the standard ProblemDetails format.\nPagination The search API is paginated using continuation tokens, see the limit-parameter above. If there are additional pages to be fetched, the property hasNextPage will be set to true, and the property continuationToken is populated with a value that should be used to fetch the next page. In order to fetch the next page, supply that value as a continuationToken query parameter. This will maintain ordering and avoid missing items or fetching them twice. This should be repeated as long as hasNextPage is true.\nOrdering Ordering can be performed on the following columns:\nCreatedAt UpdatedAt ContentUpdatedAt DueAt As Id is the primary key column, it is also technically a sortable column. However, sorting by Id is not recommended because this column, while being a lexicographically sortable UUIDv7, might be supplied by the service owner or contain a timestamp part that indicates the time of migration, not dialog creation. So for most purposes, CreatedBy is the column you want instead of Id. Columns might be sorted in ascending and descending (default) order, and multiple columns might be supplied in the OrderBy column.\nExamples These are example values that might be supplied in the OrderBy query parameter.\ncreatedat createdat_asc createdat_desc,duedate_asc contentupdatedat_desc The current ordering can be found in the collection model, next to the continuationToken and hasNextPage fields. The ordering is also embedded into continuationToken, so when paginating, supplying the continution token alone is sufficient to preserve ordering.\nBasic steps (GraphQL) This section is incomplete While we're working on it, contributions are also very welcome.

All event subscribers will receive data to their own endpoint, asynchronously. This is the recommended approach for receiving events from Altinn Events.\nIf the recipient\u0026rsquo;s webhook is unresponsive, for whatever reason, Altinn Events offers a retry mechanism with up to 12 retries. Technical details are listed below.\nMaking a subscription request The example below features a subscription request object, containing three properties. Endpoint is the absolute path to the webhook in the recipients own API, while SourceFilter and SubjectFilter are filters on source and subject, respectively.\n{ \u0026#34;EndPoint\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.skatteetaten.no/hook\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SourceFilter\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://hunderpasseren.no/by/bronnoysund\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SubjectFilter\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;/hund/ascii\u0026#34; } Example of subscription request object\nValidating a subscriber\u0026rsquo;s endpoint Once a new subscription has been registered through the API, a validation event is sent to the endpoint to validate its response status.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;694caa35-8b25-4cd7-b800-f6eeb93c56ed\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://platform.altinn.no/events/api/v1/subscriptions/1234\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;platform.events.validatesubscription\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;specversion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; } Example of validation event\nSee more details in the developer guides\nIP for outgoing traffic A static IP is used when pushing events to allow subscribers to whitelist the IP address.

	"description": "How to add dynamic tracks in the app.",
	"content": "Dynamic tracks in an application can be useful if you want to show and/or hide some pages based on input from user on previous parts of the form.\n⚠️ Dynamic tracks are unsupported as of v4 (frontend). Hiding and showing entire pages are supported by dynamic expressions (read how to hide entire pages here).\nTrigger calculation on tracks from frontend The app will perform an initial call to calculate the order when loading. To trigger calculation of dynamic tracks when switching pages, this needs to be added as a trigger on the navigation component you want. This is done by adding calculatePageOrder as a part of triggers. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;navigation-button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationButtons\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;next\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Neste\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;back\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Tilbake\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;calculatePageOrder\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;showBackButton\u0026#34;: true } Here, the frontend will make the call to the api defined in the app and use the list returned to determine which page it will go to when the user presses next. This order will also be stored in the state frontend, so that navigating will work both backwards and forwards on the given order returned from the backend.\nIf you wish to trigger calculation on every single page switch, this can be done by either entering calculatePageOrder as part of triggers for all the navigation components in the application, or by adding a trigger in Settings.json under the pages section. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;Side1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Side2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Side3\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;calculatePageOrder\u0026#34;] } } If triggers is set on the navigation component, this will overrule triggers set in Settings.json, and by doing this it is possible to control default behaviour on component level if desirable.\nThe implementation varies slightly depending on the version of the app template and Nuget packages you are using.\nv6, v7 To overrule default dynamic tracks, two changes must be made.\nCreate a class that implements the IPageOrder interface found in the Altinn.App.Core.Features.PageOrder namespace.\nYou can name and place the file in any folder you like within your project, but we suggest you use meaningful namespaces like in any other .Net project.\nusing System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features.PageOrder; using Altinn.App.Core.Models; using Altinn.App.Models; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.Custom; { public class CustomOrder : IPageOrder { /// \u0026lt;inheritdoc /\u0026gt; public async Task\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;\u0026gt; GetPageOrder(AppIdentifier appIdentifier, InstanceIdentifier instanceIdentifier, string layoutSetId, string currentPage, string dataTypeId, object formData) { List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; pageOrder = new List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;(); // Implement your logic here. return await Task.FromResult(pageOrder); } } } \u0026laquo;\u0026laquo;\u0026laquo;\u0026lt; HEAD\n2. Register you custom implementation in the _Program.cs_ class ```C# services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IPageOrder, CustomOrder\u0026gt;(); This ensuers your custom code is known to the application and that it will be executed. ``` Register you custom implementation in the Program.cs class services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IPageOrder, CustomOrder\u0026gt;(); This ensures your custom code is known to the application and that it will be executed. master\nThe interface contains a method with the name GetPageOrder. The expected output from this is a sorted list with the names of the relevant pages in the application.\nThe function provides a number of parameters that can be useful if you are using form data or other information about the user to trigger the dynamic tracks.\nappIdentifier Contains organization and app name for the application\ninstanceIdentifier Contains InstanceOwnerPartyId and InstanceGuid. If the application is stateless the object will be blank (InstanceIdentifier.NoInstance). If GetInstanceId is called on an InstanceIdentifier.NoInstance, an exception will be thrown.\nlayoutSetId If your app defines multiple layout sets, the id on the layout set in question will be submitted. If the application does not have a layout set, this string will be empty. Based on this parameter the default page order defined in the application can be retrieved.\nList\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; pageOrder = new List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;(); if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(layoutSetId)) { pageOrder = _appResourcesService.GetLayoutSettings().Pages.Order; } else { pageOrder = _appResourcesService.GetLayoutSettingsForSet(layoutSetId).Pages.Order; } This requires that the service IAppResources is made available in the class. When the service is already available through dependency injected into the class, only two steps are required:\nCreate a private variable in the state of the class private readonly IAppResources _appResourcesService; Define a constructor that takes in IAppResources and initializes the private variable that was created in step 1. public CustomOrder(IAppResources appResourcesService) { _appResourcesService = appResourcesService; } CurrentPage The page you want to navigate from will be specified in this parameter.\nFormData contains the form data. This can easily be worked with as an object by casting it to the right type Skjema skjema = (Skjema)formdata;. Here, the C# model\u0026rsquo;s name is Skjema, but for your application the name could be different. You can check this by finding the class name of the C# file in the App/models folder.\nv4, v5 For track selection to work for stateless applications, NuGet must be upgraded to 5.0.0 or later. In the file App.cs one must override the method that retrieves the default order of pages defined in Settings.json This is done by adding the below function in App.cs. The expected output from this method is a capitalized list containing the name of the relevant pages in the application.\n/// \u0026lt;inheritdoc /\u0026gt; public override async Task\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;\u0026gt; GetPageOrder(string org, string app, int instanceOwnerId, Guid instanceGuid, string layoutSetId, string currentPage, string dataTypeId, object formData) { List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; pageOrder = new List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;(); // Implement your own logic here return pageOrder; } The function receives several parameters that can be useful if you are going to use form data or other information about the end user to calculate the track selection.\nlayoutSetId If your app defines several layout sets, the id of the current layout set is submitted. If the application does not have a layout set, this string will be empty. Based on this parameter one can retrieve the default page order defined in the application: List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; pageOrder = new List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;(); if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(layoutSetId)) { pageOrder = _appResourcesService.GetLayoutSettings().Pages.Order; } else { pageOrder = _appResourcesService.GetLayoutSettingsForSet(layoutSetId).Pages.Order; } This assumes that the service IAppResources is made available in App.cs file. As the service is already dependency injected into the class, only two steps are required.\nCreate a private variable in the state of the class. private readonly IAppResources _appResourcesService; Define the new private variable equal to the service passed in the constructor of App.cs. _appResourcesService = appResourcesService; CurrentPage The page you want to navigate from must be specified in this parameter.\nFormData contains the form data. It can easily be worked with as an object by casting it to the correct type Form form = (Form)formData;. In this case C# model for the form data is called `Form\u0026rsquo; for your application, it can be another name. You can check this by finding the class name of the C# file in the App/models folder. Reflect dynamic tracks in receipt (PDF) As an app developer you must make sure to reflect the dynamic track choices made in the PDF that is created at the end of each task. In App.cs the function FormatPdf can be found:\npublic override async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { return await _pdfHandler.FormatPdf(layoutSettings, data); } As input to the method you have layoutSettings which contains the default page order under the property layoutSettings.Pages.Order. In addition, you have the form data that is associated with the step to be completed. This can be parsed to a C# model as described further up on this page.\nBy manipulating layoutSettings.Pages.Order in this method, it will be possible to duplicate the dynamic track choices made for the user. NOTE! The call to PDF handler, as shown below, must not be removed from the FormatPDF method, if you have implemented additional logic for the receipt in PDFHandler.cs.\nreturn await _pdfHandler.FormatPdf(layoutSettings, data); To avoid duplicating logic, we recommend creating a method that manipulates the page order based on form data and calling this both from FormatPdf and GetPageOrder. A code example of such an implementation follows. This can, for example, be placed in the same class that implements the interface IPageOrder to keep all logic for order in the same place.\nIn the class implementing logic for page order:\npublic async Task\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;\u0026gt; GetPageOrder(AppIdentifier appIdentifier, InstanceIdentifier instanceIdentifier, string layoutSetId, string currentPage, string dataTypeId, object formData) { List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; pageOrder = new List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;(); if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(layoutSetId)) { pageOrder = _appResourcesService.GetLayoutSettings().Pages.Order; } else { pageOrder = _appResourcesService.GetLayoutSettingsForSet(layoutSetId).Pages.Order; } UpdatePageOrder(pageOrder, (FavorittArtist)formData); return pageOrder; } public void UpdatePageOrder(List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; pageOrder, FavorittArtist formdata) { if (formdata.EnGodNrTo.Contains(\u0026#34;Tix\u0026#34;)) { pageOrder.Remove(\u0026#34;Prince\u0026#34;); } else { pageOrder.Remove(\u0026#34;Tix\u0026#34;); } } The method is then called from the method FormatPdf in App.cs\npublic override async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { UpdatePageOrder(layoutSettings.Pages.Order, (FavorittArtist)data); return await _pdfHandler.FormatPdf(layoutSettings, data); } "

	"description": "Exploring the role of the subject field in generic cloud events and its importance in event processing and authorization within Altinn.",
	"content": "The Subject in Cloud Events In generic cloud events, Altinn does not alter the event data and does not require specific knowledge of the event\u0026rsquo;s details or entities. The subject field in Altinn can represent various entities, such as parties or individuals. For example, if an event triggers when a party updates their information, the subject could be /party/{partyId}. However, in different contexts, the subject might refer to entities like airports or weather stations.\nChoosing the Right Subject When selecting a subject for your events, keep the following principles in mind:\nRelevance: The subject should directly relate to the event content. For instance, if the event concerns a party, the subject should identify that specific party.\nUniqueness: Use identifiers like partyId or organizationNumber to uniquely identify the entity referenced by the subject.\nConsistency: Maintain a consistent format for subject fields across all events. This consistency aids consumers in understanding and processing events effectively.\nAuthorization and Subject Management Altinn Events enable seamless publication and subscription across different contexts, leveraging Altinn Authorization for robust access control.\nUpon receiving an event, our system verifies the sender\u0026rsquo;s permissions based on the XACML policy associated with the Altinn application or resource.\nSimilarly, when a system requests event access via subscription or polling, the system\u0026rsquo;s rights are validated against the policy to ensure alignment with the event\u0026rsquo;s subject.\nFor example, consider scenarios where systems consume events related to their own context. If a system attempts to consume an event with a mismatched subject, authorization fails. The XACML policy ensures that only events relevant to the consuming system are accessed, maintaining data integrity and security.\nChoosing the correct subject is crucial as incorrect subjects can lead to event rejection due to failed authorization checks.\nTypes of Subjects Supported by Altinn Authorization When a subject is included in a published cloud event or subscription filter, Altinn Authorization evaluates whether publishing or consumption is authorized.\nAltinn supports predefined subject types that enrich authorization requests with detailed rights and roles information, such as partyId or organizationNumber.\nDefault Subject Types Altinn offers several default subject types, formatted as string constants:\nUser: Represents a user subject. Format: (/user/{userId}). Org (service owner): Represents a Altinn service owner subject. Format: (/org/{orgId}). Party: Represents a party subject. Format: (/party/{partyId}). Organization: Represents an organization subject. Format: (/organisation/{organisationId}). URN Subject Types URN (Uniform Resource Name) subject types are also supported:\nOrganization: Represents an organization. Format: urn:altinn:organization:identifier-no:{organization number} Person: Represents a person. Format: urn:altinn:person:identifier-no:{national identity number} Generic URN Support Altinn allows for flexible definition of generic URN subject types, accommodating custom requirements beyond predefined types. Ensure URNs conform to the syntax standards defined in RFC 2141.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to note: If the subject is pivotal for authorization, there must be a strict 1:1 correspondence between the subject attribute in your policy and the subject defined in the cloud event or subscription. Altinn Authorization does not enrich data for generic URNs that are not predefined.\n"

With Altinn Studio, you have support for:\nWCAG and ELMER 3 standards Responsive design We use components from the Common Design System to ensure a holistic user experience and good, user-friendly services.\nBoth form and API submission simultaneously Our services have built-in support for both form- and API-based data submission. Those who need to submit large amounts of data can choose to do so via the service side standard APIs. It is the same data model and the same validation rules that underlie.\nForm control You have control over how a form should appear in terms of the number of pages and components on the pages. We offer a set of form components that cover everything from simple input fields to repeating groups and advanced tables.\nAttachments We support attachment uploads, both directly in a form and via API. Attachment uploads in forms can also be distributed across multiple form components and on different pages. We have relatively rich support for functionality related to attachments, such as:\nVirus scanning of attachments Control of file types, size, and number of attachments Ability to write custom logic for extended control Tagging/marking of attachments As many attachments as you want Pre-filled data You can help the user by pre-filling the form with data that is already available. The data can come e.g., from public registers, and we have a standard configuration for pre-filled data from:\nBusiness Register National Population Register Altinn Profile/Contact and Reservation Register You can also write your own logic to pre-fill with data from e.g., your own APIs.\nCode lists We support fetching options for form field schema from a variety of standard code lists. In addition, you can define your own static code lists or connect to an API to fetch options from there. It is also possible to write logic where you customize which options from a code list are available to the user, e.g., based on something the user has answered earlier.\nDynamic expressions Dynamic expressions allow you to express logic and validations in a simple JSON-based language. Expressions can be built in our tool with a user-friendly editor. The expressions are then run both on the frontend and backend and can be used for, among other things:\nShowing and hiding elements dynamically based on the user\u0026rsquo;s choices Setting elements as required or read-only dynamically based on the user\u0026rsquo;s choices Controlling text Managing process flow Validation of form data Full flexibility Each service is a complete web application, providing great flexibility. It is entirely possible to plug in self-developed code for customizations. We offer some standard events and setups that you can hook your code into, or you can write something entirely your own.\nWe also offer ready-made code for integrations with other common solutions, e.g.:\nMaskinporten ID-porten eFormidling Events data.altinn.no Process Each service comes with a process flow that can be configured. You can define which steps you should have, who should have access, and which actions should be available to whom. Currently, we support being able to define custom steps for:\nData entry Signing Payment Feedback Summary PDF receipts are generated automatically.\nDevelopment New functionality and bug fixes are continuously released. We also have extensive documentation, including a course on using Altinn Studio for service development.\nWe have established a simple setup to create a development environment that allows you to run and test services locally on your own machine.\nBy publishing a service to a test environment, you can also test with users from the Tenor Testdata.\n"

Messages with an existing dialogue as an external reference will create a transmission which provides a logical display of related messages. The solution provides a unified user interface across the Altinn 3 workspace \u0026ldquo;Arbeidsflate\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Dialogporten\u0026rdquo;. Confirmation and due date Option to require confirmation of correspondence from recipients. Support to set a due date for when a message must be confirmed or read. Summary of advantages of Altinn Correspondence Altinn Correspondence offers several unique benefits that make it the preferred choice for digital communication with public agencies in Norway:\nCentralized communication: Altinn Correspondence serves as a central hub where all communications with public authorities can be managed from one account. This eliminates the need to manage multiple accounts or platforms. Security and confidentiality: Regular email is often not considered secure enough in many contexts. Altinn Correspondence can be used for transferring sensitive information. The platform uses strong authentication and encryption techniques to protect user data. Automation of submissions: The system allows for the automation of submissions such as tax returns and annual accounts, saving time and reducing errors. Availability: Altinn is available around the clock, allowing users to submit and receive documents at any time, which offers great flexibility compared to traditional postal services with limited hours. Integration with other systems: Altinn is designed to easily integrate with other systems in both the private and public sectors, enabling seamless data flow and efficiency. Environmentally friendly: By reducing the need for paper-based communication, Altinn contributes to more environmentally friendly administration. "

	"content": "2.1 Altinn II and Altinn 3 As a result of Altinn still being on its cloud journey, Altinn II and Altinn 3 coexist today – and will continue to do so for some years ahead. Functionality, operational environments, and data will gradually be moved from the \u0026ldquo;on-prem\u0026rdquo; solution to the cloud-based platform, as long as the framework conditions allow it.\nFramework conditions include political and administrative guidelines, sourcing strategies, business and financial guidelines, legal framework conditions, and security-related risk and vulnerability assessments.\nThis means that, at the time of writing, many operational environments, databases, functions, and services are still operated \u0026ldquo;on-prem\u0026rdquo; by a Norwegian provider. Altinn 3 utilizes these services in Altinn II, makes queries there and retrieves data for, e.g., prefilling of service owners\u0026rsquo; services established in Altinn 3.\nThe descriptions of the processing of personal data that occur in Altinn are based on today\u0026rsquo;s Altinn II and 3, but the assessments of data protection impacts in this document take into account the migration of functionality, data, and services we face in the coming years.\n2.2 Data Controller Responsibilities in Altinn All public enterprises (service owners) participating in the Altinn collaboration are individually responsible for their services in Altinn. The service owners must conduct their own assessments, risk analyses, and any data protection impact assessments related to the transition to cloud operations of their own services. Of course, the service owners can rely on Digdir\u0026rsquo;s assessments for the Altinn solution as a whole.\nThe service owners in Altinn are responsible for having a legal basis under the Personal Data Act for the use of personal data in their services.\nThe service owners must be able to justify to Altinn Central Administration (ASF) that they have the legal authority to receive the desired National Population Register information before delivery can take place.\nDuring testing related to development, maintenance, and troubleshooting, the involved enterprises are each responsible for ensuring that the use of test data complies with the requirements of the Personal Data Act.\nDigdir is responsible for personal data in the common functionality in Altinn, whether it concerns Altinn II or Altinn 3. This concerns personal data used for identification, authentication, and authorization when logging into Altinn, as well as personal data in the Altinn inbox. Digdir is also responsible for the general and collective storage of log data of user activities.\nDigdir uses private suppliers, and these will be data processors in cases where Digdir is independently responsible, and subcontractors in the processing where Digdir is considered a data processor for a service owner.\nData processing agreements have been concluded as part of a larger agreement framework with both the private suppliers and the service owners in the Altinn collaboration.\nAll involved contractual parties shall ensure to maintain a record of processing activities. In case of changes, the parties shall mutually inform each other and update the data processing agreements and the records.\n2.3 Processing Activities 2.3.1 Which personal data are processed? Since Altinn is a public common component that can be used by all public enterprises, it potentially processes personal data about the entire population of Norway. In addition, personal data about foreign nationals who communicate with Norwegian authorities through Altinn are processed.\nAlmost all conceivable types of personal data are processed in Altinn; names, national identity numbers, physical and electronic addresses, and contact information. Confidential information, trade secrets, and special categories of personal data are also processed.\n2.3.2 Digdir as Data Controller The Norwegian Digitalisation Agency considers itself the data controller for the processing of personal data related to common functionality in Altinn II and 3.\nAltinn stores a copy of several basic data registry information in Altinn II. Services running in Altinn 3 can retrieve data from Altinn II, for example, for prefilling forms and other services.\nThe National Population Register\nInformation from the National Population Register in accordance with permission from the Norwegian Tax Administration, National Register Act and the law on the Digitalisation Agency\u0026rsquo;s access to confidential National Population Register information: Name, identification number, citizenship, marital status, family relationships, status, deaths, residential address, temporary address, postal address, postal address abroad, address protection.\nDigdir is a data processor for service owners who can independently obtain confidential National Population Register information1, and has delegated rights to Digdir.\nThe Contact and Reservation Register (KRR)\nName, birth and D-number, email address and/or mobile number.\nThe Register of Legal Entities (ER)\nName, birth and D-number, address, roles in ER, notification address (email and mobile number).\nAuthentication and Authorization\nAltinn stores personal data to perform correct control of authentication and authorization to data. This includes birth number/D-number, name, mobile number, email, PINs, username, user ID, roles, and rights to services.\nLog Data\nAltinn stores log data with personal information related to user activities. The overarching steps in the activity log for a given instance of a given service are available to the user. Other activity logs (transaction logs) in Altinn II are not directly accessible to the user or others but can be disclosed upon request and with a valid legal basis. The log contains IP addresses, internal user ID, login timestamp, and activity history.\nLogging is under development in Altinn 3 and does not yet contain as comprehensive an activity history as in Altinn II.\nInbox\nAltinn has an inbox where the user is presented with their stored/submitted forms/services from the various service owners in the Altinn collaboration. This may include elements stored in Altinn I, II, and 3. The generated inbox is currently in Altinn II.\nUser Profile\nPersonal information about the user\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;profile\u0026rdquo; is stored in Altinn. The name and national identity number are shown to the user when logged in, as well as on the profile page. The profile page also displays notification addresses and phone numbers for use in notifications, and these can be changed or deleted by the user.\n2.3.3 Digdir as Data Processor Digdir performs a number of processing activities as a data processor for the service owners in Altinn.\nAltinn supports the transfer of data between users and service owners. This is performed by transferring data to the recipient\u0026rsquo;s inbox, and by prefilling information from the service owner to users. All relevant activities in the solution are logged in an activity log.\nService owners are responsible for the personal data processed in the solution when using the service owner\u0026rsquo;s services in Altinn, including data processed during filling, interim storage, forwarding, submission, and sending to and from the service owner, as well as for prefilling. This includes all functions in the solution related to an end user\u0026rsquo;s use of services in the solution, and when using Altinn\u0026rsquo;s built-in functionality for service owners.\nService owners are also responsible for personal data processed in the service owner\u0026rsquo;s own systems when requesting information from Altinn, regardless of which technical interface and functionality are used in the solution. This can, for example, be the exchange of authorization information.\nService owners have the option to specify periodic deletion of form data in the service owner\u0026rsquo;s archive in Altinn. The service owner\u0026rsquo;s archive is not continued in Altinn 3.\n2.4 Legal Basis for the Processing The legal basis for the processing of personal data in the common functionality in the Altinn solution is the Public Administration Act § 15a, cf. the eGovernment Regulations, cf. the General Data Protection Regulation article 6 no. 1 e).\nService owners using Altinn as their data processor must have a legal basis for the processing of personal data related to the individual service.\nFor some services, the legal basis for the processing of personal data related to the service will be consent, cf. the General Data Protection Regulation article 6 no. 1 a), as well as articles 7, 8, and 9.\n2.5 The Purpose of the Processing The state has several objectives with Altinn. Among other things, Altinn should contribute to achieving the societal goal of \u0026ldquo;increased cost efficiency in society\u0026rdquo;, including contributing to:\nMore cost-effective public sector through the use of eGovernment. Simplifications in the business sector through effective interaction with the public sector. The societal goal will contribute to achieving the political objectives:\nNorway shall be a world leader in offering electronic services from the public sector, both to the business community and citizens. By using electronic solutions, the public sector shall be made more efficient so that resources can be freed up to strengthen the welfare offer. By using electronic solutions, the business sector shall have its administrative burdens related to the implementation of public regulations reduced. The public sector shall avoid parallel investments related to the production and making available of electronic services. In addition, the government has established the principle of \u0026ldquo;digital first choice\u0026rdquo; in the Public Administration Act § 15 a. Digital first choice is a principle that implies that the administration, as far as possible, is available online, and that online services are the main rule for the administration\u0026rsquo;s communication with the users. This shall provide better services for the users, simpler application processes, and faster responses.\nThe purpose of the processing of personal data in the common functionality in the Altinn solution is to enable the realization of these objectives for Altinn and about digital first choice. More specifically, by contributing to facilitating simplified, streamlined, and secure interaction between the users and public enterprises – by supporting the identification, authentication, and authorization of the parties in the electronic dialogue.\nFor the service owners in Altinn, the purpose of the processing in each service will have many similarities with the purpose of Altinn\u0026rsquo;s processing of personal data in common functionality. In addition, there is the fulfillment of each service owner\u0026rsquo;s specific societal mission, as laid\nFor the service owners in Altinn, the purpose of the processing in each individual service will have many similarities with the purpose of Altinn\u0026rsquo;s processing of personal data in common functionality. In addition, there is the fulfillment of each service owner\u0026rsquo;s specific societal mission, as laid down in allocation letters, through legislation, or other directives from the Parliament or the Government.\nhttps://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2023-06-09-29\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"

	"content": "3.1 New Rules for the Transfer of Personal Data to the USA If personal data is to be transferred from the EU/EEA to a third country, including the USA, there must be a basis for transfer according to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A commonly used basis for transferring personal data to the USA was an agreement called the EU-US Privacy Shield. In the Schrems II judgment from 2020, this agreement was declared invalid.\nHowever, on July 10, 2023, a new framework for the transfer of personal data between the EU/EEA and the USA was decided through an adequacy decision from the European Commission that had immediate effect.\nAn adequacy decision is a decision from the European Commission that an area outside the EU and EEA has rules that protect privacy in a manner equivalent to that in the EU and EEA. If the European Commission has made such a decision, personal data can be transferred to the area in accordance with the decision, and the transfer will be comparable to transfers between countries within the EU/EEA. It is important to specify that other requirements in the data protection regulations must be followed, such as having a basis for processing and a data processing agreement, if necessary. It is also important to assess subcontractors, to see if they are certified and if they are located in third countries other than the USA, as this adequacy decision only applies to transfers to the USA.\nThis new framework, the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, consists of a self-certification scheme. American companies can become self-certified if they commit to processing personal data in accordance with the framework, and if they offer free and independent complaint mechanisms for individuals.\nSpecifically, this means that if personal data is transferred to a certified American company, no other basis for transfer other than this adequacy decision is needed. It is also not necessary to assess the protection level in the USA or to implement security measures. This specific interpretation of the effect of the adequacy decision is adopted by the Data Protection Authority1.\nMicrosoft Corporation is certified2 under this scheme, and the adequacy decision is thus a valid basis for the potential transfer of personal data from the EU/EEA to the USA.\n3.2 Altinn 3 As mentioned, Altinn 3 is run on Microsoft Azure in Norwegian data centers. Digdir has set up policies in Azure on which locations are allowed for resources in Azure. This is Norway and Northern and Western Europe. We choose another location than Norway, including Northern and Western Europe, only in cases where the Azure resource to be used is not available with Norway as the location.\nData storage related to running services and end-users is done in Norway. Some data related to development/design-time for Altinn Studio (the tool used by service developers) is stored in Europe (EU/EEA). In addition, Digdir has an agreement with Microsoft on technical support services, including support. Support can be provided in several different ways. Digdir will, as a clear starting point, only use support services provided within Norway and the EU/EEA. It is Digdir itself that controls when and if to contact support personnel, and what the support provider should see and have access to.\nMore information about security and the configuration of Altinn\u0026rsquo;s use of Azure is documented in Security in Altinn 3.\n3.3 Use of Data Processors and Sub-processors According to the agreements entered into, Microsoft is a data processor for Digdir for the processing of personal data where Digdir is the data controller. For those processes where Digdir is considered a data processor for a service owner, Microsoft is a sub-processor.\nMicrosoft, like the other major international cloud providers, makes extensive use of subcontractors and third parties, for example, in the form of support centers in various places in the world3. The standard terms are arranged so that the customer consents in general (by entering into the agreement) to the provider using such subcontractors/sub-processors.\nMicrosoft describes that their potential subcontractors are contractually obliged to meet strict data protection requirements that are equivalent or stronger than the contractual obligations Microsoft provides to its customers. The subcontractors must, among other things, meet the requirements under the GDPR and consent to and comply with the EU\u0026rsquo;s standard contractual clauses. According to the GDPR, Microsoft considers these providers as data processors and requires them to use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. Microsoft further requires that all subcontractors join Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s security and privacy program for suppliers.\nHere it is important to specify, as mentioned above, that Altinn 3 is run in Norwegian data centers, and that Digdir has set up policies in Azure about which locations are allowed for resources in Azure. In addition, it is Digdir itself that controls when and if to contact support personnel, and what the support provider should see and have access to.\n3.4 Intelligence Risk and the Transfer of Personal Data Version 2.0 of our DPIA contained fairly extensive assessments of general intelligence risk and intelligence risk related to the transfer of personal data to the USA due to American intelligence legislation. After the Schrems II judgment, there was, among other things, a requirement to assess intelligence risk, and therefore this was considered in the then version of the DPIA. Because the adequacy decision is now a valid basis for transfer, as mentioned, there is no longer a requirement to conduct an assessment of the protection level for personal data that may be transferred to the USA. The European Commission has assumed in the adequacy decision that the protection level for personal data in the USA is sufficient. This is why the extensive assessments of intelligence risk are not included in this latest version of the DPIA.\nDigdir will, however, generally refer to the likelihood that any state likely conducts intelligence activities to a greater or lesser extent. This probably applies both to states Norway is allied with and also other states. There are various examples that support this view:\nRussia and China conduct intelligence operations and are considered the two foremost threat actors against Norway4. The USA conducts intelligence operations, as expressed, among other things, in the Schrems judgments. Norway and other European countries conduct intelligence operations, as expressed, among other things, in decisions from the ECHR and intelligence laws. Therefore, it can be assumed that all (cloud service) providers will be subject to some form of intelligence operations. This can be both in the country where the provider\u0026rsquo;s headquarters are established and in the countries the provider operates in. For example, an American cloud service provider operating in a country in the EU/EEA may be subject to both American intelligence legislation and intelligence legislation of the EU/EEA country the cloud service operates in.\nThe risk of illegal intelligence operations will be one of several risks that must be assessed for the solution. There will always be a risk. A data controller cannot assume that the mere existence of a risk of intelligence operations is unacceptable. The size of the risk is crucial. Furthermore, it must be seen in the context of other risks. Often, unfortunately, solutions and measures that are secure against some types of risk have vulnerabilities and weaknesses that entail other types of risk.\nAssuming sufficient \u0026ldquo;in-transit\u0026rdquo; encryption is implemented, bulk collection systems can normally only make use of metadata about internet traffic. Digdir otherwise assesses that there is a relatively low probability that the data sent to Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s data centers in Northern and Western Europe is of such interest that foreign intelligence agencies will link them to individuals.\nDigdir has worked to reduce the risk that other countries\u0026rsquo; intelligence agencies can gain access through various types of measures. These measures are built up of technical, legal, or organizational mechanisms, often by a combination of these. Measures most often reduce probability, but in some cases, can also affect the consequence.\nMany of the measures that contribute to reducing intelligence risk are the same as those that reduce security risk. Here, measures such as control of systems and data flow, pseudonymization, deletion routines, access control, and monitoring can be mentioned.\nWe have ensured encryption of data during transport, and encryption of data at rest/storage. Digdir has also ensured that we ourselves, or our provider, have implemented encryption during transport and storage, geographical restriction to Norway and the EU, including Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s implementation of the EU Data Boundary and Customer Lockbox.\nFor the types of personal data and the processing for which Digdir is the data controller, as referred to in previous chapters, we consider that our chosen data processor has provided sufficient guarantees that they will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that ensure the processing meets the requirements of the GDPR and protects the rights of the data subject in the face of intelligence activities.\nFurthermore, we believe that both we, as the data controller, and our data processor, have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures, which have led to us achieving a security level that is suitable with regard to the risks we have mapped out.\nDigdir emphasizes that a data controller is always responsible for its own assessments, and therefore each service owner – as the data controller for their services – must make assessments based on the context of the specific service and the personal data processed in it.\n3.5 Work-related Personal Data and Support 3.5.1 Work-related Personal Data Digdir uses Microsoft Azure for Altinn 3, and Microsoft has committed to a so-called \u0026ldquo;EU Data Boundary\u0026rdquo; which will ensure that data of European customers will only be stored and processed within the EEA.\nAs of January 30, 2023, Microsoft has confirmed that it is no longer necessary to transfer data out of the EEA in connection with multi-factor authentication (MFA). It is only if one chooses phone call verification with a custom greeting, that this will be serviced from the USA5. This is not used by Digdir and our employees or consultants.\nFollowing this, Digdir assumes that the authentication process in Azure does not lead to the transfer of personal data out of the EEA.\nService owners using Altinn 3 are advised to set their own restrictions for their employees and hired consultants, to avoid the transfer of work-related personal data to third countries.\n3.5.2 Support Digdir has entered into an agreement regarding Microsoft Unified Support. Support can be provided in several different ways. Digdir will, as a starting point, use support services provided within Norway and the EU/EEA. It is Digdir itself that controls when and if to contact support personnel, and what the support provider should see and have access to.\nMicrosoft\u0026rsquo;s standard data processor agreement \u0026ldquo;Data Protection Addendum for Microsoft Products and Services\u0026rdquo; defines \u0026ldquo;technical support services\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;professional services\u0026rdquo; that \u0026ldquo;help the customer identify and resolve issues affecting products\u0026rdquo;.\nIn most cases of support, problems can be resolved without actual access to data, by solving it at the component level where data is not available in plaintext. Protection is established through one or more layers of encryption, along with measures such as \u0026ldquo;segregation of duties\u0026rdquo;, which ensures that the same team/person does not have access to both the infrastructure and the data/encryption keys.\nOccasionally, the cause of errors or problems may actually lie in the data, and then Microsoft will provide support personnel with minimal access to this through \u0026ldquo;Customer Lockbox\u0026rdquo;6, but only after Digdir\u0026rsquo;s request. Customer Lockbox is a Microsoft-supported service that provides extra protection against insight into and leakage of personal data in connection with maintenance and support in case of errors. This allows us to control in detail who is given temporary access, to what, and for how long, as well as detailed tracking of this. This ensures that fragments of data and any personal data among these are protected from broader sharing via the support/case management system.\nThe protection in the measure lies in a real isolation of the information, but at the same time, it relies on measures of organizational and technical nature that are entirely under the provider\u0026rsquo;s direction. Beyond contractual guarantees, we do not have a great ability to control that the provider does not intentionally circumvent the measures or is forced to do so by disclosure requirements. However, the circumstances around the information made available in such a situation and the transience of this would indicate that it does not increase the risk of information falling into the hands of intelligence services.\nDisclosure requirements are person-specific, so the fact that fragments of personal data that are available to named personnel for a short period would be subject to a disclosure procedure would require significant backdoors and secret surveillance regimes. There is no reason to believe that this is anything other than hypothetical. As part of the rollout of its \u0026ldquo;EU Data Boundary,\u0026rdquo; Microsoft has stated that the \u0026ldquo;EU Data Boundary\u0026rdquo; will be extended to also include technical support that necessitates viewing customer data.\nDigdir believes that an overall assessment of the protection level and the low risk of unintended access to personal data under the use of Customer Lockbox indicates that a potential limited and controlled transfer of personal data to a third country under such support need does not constitute a greater intrusion into the data subject\u0026rsquo;s rights than is necessary in a democratic society. This is based on a proportionality assessment where the theoretical intervention is compared with legal security mechanisms and the technical measures in the form of, among others, Customer Lockbox.\nAgain, individual service owners using Altinn 3 – as the data controller – must make their own assessments of the personal data processed in their services, and whether the theoretically possible intervention is proportional and necessary in a democratic society – assessed based on the context of the personal data and the specific service.\nNew Rules for the Transfer of Personal Data to the USA\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/participant/6474\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nMicrosoft Professional services and suppliers and Commercial Support Subprocessors from Official Microsoft Download Center\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://nsm.no/aktuelt/risiko-2024-nasjonal-sikkerhet-er-et-felles-ansvar\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-mfa-data-residency\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/customer-lockbox-overview\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"

Data minimisation: Automatically remove attachments when they should no longer be available. Compliance: Support legal or contractual requirements for how long specific documents may be stored or be available to the recipient. Reduced risk: Limit how long sensitive documents are available on correspondences. How attachment expiry works in the lifecycle At a high level, the lifecycle for an attachment with an expiry date is:\nThe attachment is created and linked to one or more correspondences\nThe attachment is stored and can be downloaded by authorised recipients, in line with the normal post-published lifecycle.\nWhen the attachment’s expiry date is reached:\nThe attachment is marked as expired in the correspondence system. The underlying file is deleted from storage in the correspondence system. The attachment is made unavailable for download via the APIs.

The process follows these steps:\nCollection - contact points are retrieved from data sources Normalisation - all contact points are standardised to comparable formats Comparison - contact points that are considered identical are reduced to a single entry Delivery - the final set of unique contact points is used for notification delivery Format normalisation Before comparison, contact points are normalised to handle different formats:\nMobile numbers International formats are standardised (e.g. +4799999999, 004799999999, and 99999999 are treated as identical) Email addresses Upper and lower case letters are treated as identical (eksempel-1@default.digdir.no and Eksempel-1@default.digdir.no) "

	"description": "Migration of Delegations for Altinn Correspondence",
	"content": "Delegations of rights can be done in different ways, and if this is not migrated as part of the migration job for messages, the ultimate consequence will be that users lose access to messages.\nBrief Overview of Delegations Delegations can occur at the service level (Service Delegation/Single Right Delegation) for specific rights. Delegations can occur at the message level (Instance Delegation) for specific rights. Delegations can both be granted and revoked. This happens continuously during the lifetime of the service and the message. There is a difference in the rights models between Altinn 2 Message and Altinn 3: \u0026ldquo;Read\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Write\u0026rdquo; =\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Read\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;ArchiveRead\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;ArchiveDelete\u0026rdquo; =\u0026gt; does not exist in A3, will be mapped to \u0026ldquo;Read\u0026rdquo; Based on these facts, it is clear that delegations must be migrated at both the service and instance levels from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3. Additionally, this cannot be done as a one-time job but must be synchronized when changes occur.\nWhat is Migrated? Service delegation / Single-right delegation. Instance delegation is currently not supported in Altinn 3, and therefore cannot be migrated or synchronized. Automatic Migration and Sync of Delegations As part of the migration process, service delegation / single-right delegation is migrated and kept synchronized for the migration resources.\nTechnical Implementation A DelegationSync batch job has been created that runs in the Altinn 2 infrastructure every xx minutes. On each run it checks whether there have been changes to delegations since the previous run and sends these over to the Altinn 3 APIs. Manual Import of Delegations It is possible to request a manual import of delegations from an Altinn 2 correspondence service to an Altinn 3 correspondence resource to ease re-establishment.\nNote: Make sure a new resource is established in the relevant environment(s) before ordering.\nImportant: Altinn does NOT recommend migrating rights without a thorough risk assessment beforehand. Our experience shows that not all organizations actively manage who has access in Altinn. This can result in multiple individuals having access without \u0026ldquo;need-to-know\u0026rdquo;. We therefore believe it may pose a risk to blindly copy existing Altinn II delegations to the new Altinn 3 resources. To order a delegation import, send an email:\nTo: tjenesteeier@altinn.no Subject: \u0026ldquo;Import of delegations from Altinn 2 Correspondence Service to Altinn 3 Resource\u0026rdquo; In the body: Specify the environments and the time this should be executed, and assign per service: the Altinn 2 service code and edition code that will be the source, as well as the Altinn 3 resource that should receive the imported delegations. Specify: \u0026ldquo;Ønsker at saken sendes til Altinn 2 Forvaltning.\u0026rdquo; (Request that the case is sent to Altinn 2 Operations.) Our technicians will then perform a manual run of the DelegationSync job with the given parameters.\n"

Reliance on this token enables the service provider systems to not have to make requests back to Altinn Authorization in order to authorize requests, but can instead rely on the information in the dialogtoken submitted by the end user system, which reduces latency and enables better performance.\nsequenceDiagram autonumber participant SBS as End-user system participant DP as Dialogporten participant AA as Altinn Authorization participant TT as Service Provider DP-\u003e\u003eAA: Authorize request AA-\u003e\u003eDP: Return decision DP-\u003e\u003eSBS: Return dialog + dialog token SBS-\u003e\u003eTT: Perform action, supply dialogtoken TT-\u003e\u003eTT: Validate dialog token and action TT-\u003e\u003eSBS: Return response Diagram showing overall end-user system flow using dialogtoken.

	"description": "Learn about how Dialogporten integrates with Altinn Events",
	"content": "Introduction Dialogporten offers mechanisms to enable end-user and service owner systems to detect changes made to dialogs, eliminating the need to regularly poll the dialog list for changes.\nEvents refer to technical application events generated by Dialogporten (or the service provider) and published through the Event component in Altinn. Events can be consumed by authorized parties and the service provider, according to the authorization rules defined by the service provider.\nHow Dialogporten utlizes events Dialogporten will automatically publish events of predefined types for all changes in Dialogporten, including the creation and updates performed on the dialog and its transmissions and activities. The authorization policy associated with the main service resource governs who are allowed to consume these events on behalf of the organization/citizen \u0026ldquo;owning\u0026rdquo; the dialog.\nDialogporten will also produce events whenever a dialog (or a dialog change) is first seen, ie. when a single dialog\u0026rsquo;s details is retrieved from the API (seen events are not emitted as a result of requests to the search/list API).\nAll events refer to the dialog the event is related to, and some events will contain additional metadata which allows end-user systems and service provider systems to build business logic associated with a particular state change or activity performed on a dialog.\nHow service providers and end-user system providers can utilize events Altinn Events supports (and strongly encourages) the use of \u0026ldquo;subscriptions\u0026rdquo; when consuming events, which uses a webhook/push-based approach of distributing event notifications.\nOne of the main advantages of utilizing events this way is to be able to react to new/changed information without the need for frequent and constant \u0026ldquo;polling\u0026rdquo;, which is making repeated requests to endpoint at a (typically very short) interval to check if changes has occured. On the other hand, using webhooks eliminates this wasteful approach by \u0026ldquo;reversing the API\u0026rdquo;; Dialogporten/events will instead notify any authorized subscribers as soon as a change occurs.\nSse cases include:\nEnd-user systems monitoring if new dialogs of a particular type are created End-user systems monitoring if updates to an existing dialog are made by the service provider Service owner acting on the user having seen a dialog or opened a dialog in order to determine the need for sending reminders A second service owner, granted access to consume events associated with a particular service process reaching an end state, uses these events as a trigger to initiate a related business process pro-actively without user interaction. Low latency per-dialog update detection for GUIs Dialogporten supports a custom update subscription protocol, which utilizes GraphQL subscriptions supplied directly by Dialogporten. This is useful for online, interactive GUIs where the user is present, which enables the system to monitor a single dialog for updates.\nTypically this is used to enable GUIs to notify the end user immediately if a currently accessed/opened dialog has been changed, which is useful when dealing with state changing write actions.\nRead more\nUser guide for detecting changes Technical reference information about Dialogporten events "

	"title": "Getting dialog details",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "How to get dialog details in Dialogporten",
	"content": "Introduction This guide shows how a end-user system can access specific dialogs in Dialogporten using either REST or GraphQL APIs.\nNote that the data structure that is returned when getting single dialogs differ from the one returned on the search endpoint; the dialog details view offer more information about the dialog and what the user may access.\nBasic steps (REST) Authenticate as a end-user Find the dialog ID you want to access. To search for accessible dialogs, see the search endpoint. Dialog IDs can also be discovered via events. Perform a GET request to /api/v1/enduser/dialogs/{dialogId}. Returned information The data structure returned consists of all the data available in the search endpoint, and additionally\ntitle, summary and additional info (text) front channel embeds (ie. referenced content) actions that can be perfomed activity log transmissions For full details, see the dialog details entity.\nAuthorization Dialogporten will perform a authorization check against Altinn Authorization for the dialog and its components, checking whether or not the authenticated identity has access to\nany or all of the defined actions any or all of the defined transmissions These entities have a flag, isAuthorized, which is either true or false. If false, the URLs associated with the action or transmission is replaced with a special value, urn:dialogporten:unauthorized.\nAuthentication level Resources in Altinn Authorization may contain a policy that adds a requirement for a minimum level of authentication in order to access that resource. Altinn supports four security levels.\nIn ID-porten, authentication methods use the eIDAS Levels of Assurance (LoA) to indicate security levels. There are three levels, \u0026ldquo;low\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;substantial\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;high\u0026rdquo;; however ID-porten currently only supports authentication methods giving \u0026ldquo;substantial\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;high\u0026rdquo; levels of security. These are mapped to Altinn security levels 3 and 4, respectively.\nAttempting to access dialog details with a token with insufficient authentication level will result in a 403 Forbidden error.\nAbout system users While eIDAS LoA does not define authentication levels for non-interactive, enterprise authentications such as Maskinporten, for historic reasons, Altinn maps these authentications - which in practice, involves system users - to level 3.\neIDAS mandates that both \u0026ldquo;substantial\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;high\u0026rdquo; levels of security can only be attained by multi-level authentication (MFA). So while one can assume that \u0026ldquo;substantial\u0026rdquo; maps to \u0026ldquo;level 3\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;high\u0026rdquo; maps to \u0026ldquo;level 4\u0026rdquo;, the inverse is not necessarily true. Working with dialog details The data returned will look something like the structure below.\nThis is an abbreviated and simplified model where some mandatory fields are omitted/altered for brevity { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;01945fca-3189-7159-b3e6-d6ff8f9cca0c\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;org\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;serviceResource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource:some-service\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;party\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:person:identifier-no:08895699684\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;content\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Melding fra TTD\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;summary\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Et sammendrag på inntil 250 tegn her.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mainContentReference\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://externalsite.com/fce/e859b33d54ca\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mediaType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;application/vnd.dialogporten.frontchannelembed-url;type=text/markdown\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;dialogToken\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;eyJhbGciOiJ..snip..RwLXN0YWdpbmctMjQ\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;attachments\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;displayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Vedleggsnavn.pdf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;urls\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://externalsite.com/attch/vedlegg.pdf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;consumerType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Gui\u0026#34; } ] } ], \u0026#34;guiActions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://externalsite.com/gui/formfill\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;priority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Primary\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Gå til utfylling\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;apiActions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;20250215\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;url\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://externalsite.com/api/formpost\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;httpMethod\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;requestSchema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://externalsite.com/schemas/20250215\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;responseSchema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://externalsite.com/schemas/response\u0026#34; } ] } Note that the data structure contains actual content - it contains instead references to content via either front channel embeds or attachments, both of which refer to endpoints external to Dialogporten.\nAdditional requests will have to be performed in order to fetch these resources. The end user system should expect that all these endpoints require authentication and that the same authorization is enforced as on the dialog, action or attachment itself. Typically will the endpoints require that the same kind of token (ID-porten or Maskinporten with system user) is provided but with a separate scope.

You can disable this by setting the value displayAppOwnerNameInHeader to false.\nApp/config/applicationmetadata.json { \u0026#34;logo\u0026#34;: { ... \u0026#34;displayAppOwnerNameInHeader\u0026#34;: false } } You can also override the alt text for the logo:\nApp/config/texts/resource.nb.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appLogo.altText\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Logo for Brønnøysund Register Centre\u0026#34; } Use custom logo In order to use a custom logo, the logo must first be uploaded.\nCreate a folder named wwwroot. This should be under App, App/wwwroot. Upload a logo following the design guidelines to the folder. Remember that each text resource file (resource.[language].json) must be updated for changes to apply to all languages.\nSyntax App/config/texts/resource.nb.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appLogo.url\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/{appID}/{logoName}.svg\u0026#34; } The appID here refers to the id property in applicationmetadata.json.\nExample App/config/texts/resource.nb.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appLogo.url\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/digdir/bli-tjenesteeier/logo_digdir.svg\u0026#34; } Finally, source in applicationmetadata.json needs to be set to resource in order to access the logo uploaded.

It has two valid values:\n\u0026quot;org\u0026quot;: The logo is fetched from altinn-orgs.json. \u0026quot;resource\u0026quot;: The logo is fetched from text resource files. Fetches the value with the id \u0026quot;appLogo.url\u0026quot;. displayAppOwnerNameInHeader Specifies whether the service owner\u0026rsquo;s name should be displayed next to the logo. Retrieves the service owner\u0026rsquo;s name directly from altinn-orgs.json if appOwner is not defined in the text resource files.\nsize Setting the size is only available with Altinn.App.Core version 7.15.0 and higher For some logos, the default size of the logo might not always fit. The size can be specified with the size property. It has three valid values:\n\u0026quot;small\u0026quot; \u0026quot;medium\u0026quot; \u0026quot;large\u0026quot; The size defaults to \u0026quot;small\u0026quot; if not specified.\nDesign guidelines for app owner logo Size and scale: The logo should be appropriately sized and have enough clear space around it to prevent visual clutter. A good rule of thumb is to keep the logo\u0026rsquo;s width to no more than 32px.\nAlignment: The logo will be aligned to the top left corner of the form for consistency and easy recognition.\nContrast and legibility: The logo should have enough contrast against the background to ensure that it is legible. If the logo includes text, the text should be readable and not too small.\nLogo variants: If your logo comes in different variations (e.g., color, black and white, monochrome), choose the one that best suits the form\u0026rsquo;s design and background color.\nTesting and iteration: The logo placement should be tested on different devices and screen sizes to ensure that it looks and functions as intended. Test it on mobile screens and tablets. Consider gathering feedback from users or colleagues and iterating on the design if needed.\nAccessibility: The logo\u0026rsquo;s colors and placement should meet accessibility guidelines to accommodate users with different visual needs. Alt tag on the logo is required for screen reader. The alt text of the logo should reflect the language selected eg. \u0026ldquo;The Directorate of Education logo\u0026rdquo;.\n"

	"content": "React React is a library for developing component based applications. It is done by having declared html as xml in javascript code, and that is again transpiled into vanilla javascript for the browser to render into a page.\nGet started by looking at the Getting started docs or trying the tutorial.\nImportant concepts The 2 most important concepts when working with React components are state and props.\nState is a collection of properties, controlled by the component, that say what the current state of the component is - this can be used to determine how the component should be rendered.\nProps is a collection of properties that are passed to the component as input. They can also be used to determine how the component should render.\nAny time the state or props of a component is updated, the component re-renders.\nClass components Class components are React components defined as classes. We used class components when we started building Altinn Studio, and most of the components for the Altinn Studio applications are still class components.\n// Example component import * as React from React export interface IExampleComponentProps { id: string; title: string; } export interface IExampleComponentState { value: string; } export class ExampleComponent extends React.Component\u0026lt;IExampleComponentProps, IExampleComponentState\u0026gt; { public onChange = (event: any) =\u0026gt; { setState(event.target.value); } public render( \u0026lt;div id={this.props.id}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label htmlFor={`input-${this.props.id}`}\u0026gt;{this.props.title}\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input id={`input-${this.props.id}`} value={this.state.value} onChange={this.onChange} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } Read more about class components here.\nWhen writing a new component, or refactoring an existing class component, use hooks where possible.\nFunctional components - React hooks Hooks are new in React 16.8, and allow us to use state directly in functional components - components that are defined as functions. Using functional components with hooks results in cleaner, shorter code. Most of the components for the Altinn Apps applications are functional components using hooks.\n// Example component import * as React from React export interface IExampleComponentProps { id: string; title: string; } export function ExampleComponent(props: IExampleComponentProps) : JSX.Element { const [value, setValue] = React.useState\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); const onChange = (event: any) =\u0026gt; { setValue(event.target.value); } return( \u0026lt;div id={props.id}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label htmlFor={`input-${props.id}`}\u0026gt;{props.title}\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input id={`input-${props.id}`} value={value} onChange={onChange} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } Read more about React hooks here\nLinks Documentation for react components "

	"content": "Altinn Notifications supports sending notifications to recipients identified by national identity or organization numbers. Recipient contact details and reservation status are checked during order placement and again at the requested send time.\nThe ordering entity must verify whether notifications were sent, as lookup results are provided in the order response and updated after the requested send time.\nRecipient lookup The recipient lookup result reflects the contact information available at a specific moment. If there\u0026rsquo;s a significant delay between ordering and sending a notification, the final lookup may yield different results. Therefore, always verify the notification\u0026rsquo;s status after the scheduled send time to confirm successful generation, dispatch, and delivery. The recipientLookup object indicates the likelihood of Altinn successfully delivering notifications to the specified recipients. Reviewing this information allows for alternative actions before the send time if recipients are reserved or lack contact details.\nProperty Description status The result of the initial lookup. isReserved A list of national identity numbers for recipients who have chosen to opt out of electronic communication. missingContact A list of national identity and/or organization numbers for recipients who do not have contact details. The status property can have one of three values:\nStatus Description Success Recipient lookup succeeded for all recipients. PartialSuccess Recipient lookup succeeded for some recipients.

Additionally, Altinn uses a set of registries to retrieve contact details if the sender has not provided them for a recipient.\nThe Contact and Reservation Register (Kontakt- og reservasjonsregisteret) Altinn maintains a local copy of this register, which can be used to retrieve name and contact details when the recipient is identified by their national identity number.\nRead more about the Contact and Reservation Register here.\nThe Notification Addresses for Businesses (Varslingsadresser for Enheter) Altinn also maintains a local copy of this register, which can be used to retrieve name and contact details when the recipient is identified by their organization number.\nRead more about the Notification Addresses for Businesses here.\nAltinn user profile End users can register their preferred contact details for notifications related to organizations in their Altinn profile. These contact details can be used when the notification recipient is identified by an organization that the user can represent.\n"

	"description": "Altinn Notifications offers a feature called Send Condition, which allows you to create notification orders that are sent to recipients only when a specified condition is met.",
	"content": "Introduction The Send Condition feature enables you to create a notification order that will only be sent to recipient(s) if a specified condition is met. You can choose to send the notification immediately or schedule it for a future date.\nExample Use Case A common use case is setting reminders, where a notification is sent only if a user has not completed a specific action. With the send condition, both the initial notification requesting the action and the reminder notification can be ordered at the same time with different send dates.\nCondition Evaluation A send condition is evaluated as either true or false, and it is considered true when the condition for sending the notification is met.\nCondition Endpoint The send condition is checked by the application through the condition endpoint specified in the notification order. Below is an example of a notification order request with the condition endpoint:\n{ \u0026#34;subject\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Reminder to complete task\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sendersReference\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;application:qwerty\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;requestedSendTime\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2024-07-24T12:00:00Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;body\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Reminder to complete application by 31.07.

The token will be a Maskinporten token that includes Digitaliseringsdirektoratet\u0026rsquo;s organization number as part of the consumer claim, along with the scope altinn:system/notifications.condition.check.\nMethod: GET Headers: Authorization: Bearer \u0026lt;maskinporten_token\u0026gt; Content-Type: application/json URL Parameters: None Example Request GET /application/qwerty/reminderRequired HTTP/1.1 Host: serviceowner.com Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI...

This will always be altinn:system/notifications.condition.check iss: Specifies the issuer of the token. Production: https://maskinporten.no/ Test: https://test.maskinporten.no/ consumer: Specifies the consumer information. ID will always be 0192:991825827, representing Digdir. Response After evaluating the condition specified in the request, the endpoint should respond with a JSON object indicating whether the notification should be sent. The response code must be 200 OK, regardless of whether the condition is met.\nAny other status code results in a retry attempt from the API client.\nExample Response { \u0026#34;sendNotification\u0026#34;: true } sendNotification: A boolean value (true or false) indicating whether the notification should be sent (true) or not (false).

This functionality is based on the grid system from Material-UI, and is similar to the grid system from bootstrap. The grid system is based on a construction of containers in 12 parts, where you can assign children (items) of a grid-container a given part of this width. Material-UI also offers the ability to dynamically change how much of the screen you want to occupy based on which screen size the user is on. The following sizes with breakpoints are defined:\nxs: 0px sm: 600px md: 1024px lg: 1440px xl: 1920px To place components side by side horizontally, small changes must be done in form layout. A separate property grid has been defined, where you can fill in desired width on the different sizes. Here is an example where two input fields has been set to cover half the screen (some props are removed for readability):\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 6, } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 6 } } } For the components above, the size has been set to 6 (half width) for the size xs. Since: xs is the smallest size available, this will apply from size xs and up, i.e. from xs to xl. The setup above will give the following result:\nHalf width on form Since there are 12 sections available on the page width, it is up to the app developer to assign how large of a share a component should have. If you want a component to take up 2/12, and another 6/12 and the last one 4/12, then this is possible. It is important to consider the user experience when performing these changes, and before you place components side by side you should think it through. Components with longer texts and descriptions quickly become small and unclear if these are placed side by side. If you are to use longer texts and descriptions it is recommended that these occupy the full width of the form.\nIf you in the example above wanted the components to take up the whole width of the screen, until the screen passed 960px in size, you could set up the following layout:\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;sm\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;md\u0026#34;: 6 } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;sm\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;md\u0026#34;: 6 } } } Then, the components would not be be placed side by side unless the user is using a screen of 960px or more.\ninnerGrid og labelGrid In addition to setting the width of the grid in the component, we also have added the opportunity to control innerGrid and labelGrid. This gives you the opportunity to control the width of label and input in the same way. This is typically used when you want to make an input field smaller (to give a visual indication that a small answer is expected), or if you want to display label and input on the same line (like in a table.)\nYou can think of the component in this manner:\n\u0026lt;Grid id=\u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Grid id=\u0026#34;labelGrid\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Komponentens tekster \u0026lt;/Grid\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Grid id=\u0026#34;innerGrid\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Komponentens input \u0026lt;/Grid\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Grid\u0026gt; Here, you will have the opportunity to control the width of both the outer grid and the inner grid. Example:\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;innerGrid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 6 } } } } Here, it has been set that the component grid shall occupy the whole width, while limiting the component\u0026rsquo;s input to only occupy half the width. Inner grid can be controlled for these components:\nInput TextArea FileUpload Dropdown Datepicker The example above will give the following output:\nInnerGrid example output A tableview with labels placed to the side will appear if you set labelGrid and innerGrid so that the sum equals 12 (or less). This may be wise if you have a long list of related questions. It is often wise to not use such a layout on the smallest screens, so feel free to use md.\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;labelGrid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;md\u0026#34;: 8 }, \u0026#34;innerGrid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;md\u0026#34;: 4 } } } } This will look something like this:\nlabelGrid example output Two radiobuttons or checkboxes vertically aligned By default radiobuttons and checkboxes with only two options will be displayed on one line. If you would like them to be displayed below each other as this:\nVertical aligned radiobuttons you need to change/add \u0026ldquo;layout\u0026rdquo;:\u0026ldquo;column\u0026rdquo; in the component configuration.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;radio-under-hverandre\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;RadioButtons\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Vil du har to linjer når det kun er to svaralternativ?\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;someRadiobuttonFieldWith2Options\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ja\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Nei\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;column\u0026#34; } Formatting numbers Numbers inside of input fields can be formatted. This is done by adding a property formatting to the input component. Formatting options are documented in a JSON-schema, and will appear automatically in intellisense when editing the component in e.g. VSCode.\nThe example below will result in an input field for numbers, where the number will be formatted with , between each thousand, and $ in front of the number.\nThe formatting is for frontend display only, and the numbers added to an input field with formatting will be saved unformatted. Formatted number in input field { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;numberComponent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;number\u0026#34;, }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;someNumberField\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;formatting\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;number\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;thousandSeparator\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;,\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$\u0026#34; } } }, The following properties can be controlled with dynamic expressions:\nformatting.number.prefix formatting.number.suffix formatting.number.thousandSeparator formatting.number.decimalSeparator Prefix and suffix You can also show a prefix and/or suffix next to an input field like this:\nThis is configured in textResourceBindings like so:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;numberComponent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Number\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Prefix\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;suffix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Suffix\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;someNumberField\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: false, }, Language-sensitive number formatting It is possible to assign dynamic formatting of numbers in input fields. You can choose between \u0026quot;currency\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;unit\u0026quot;. Based on selected language in the app, they formatting thousand and decimal separators and prefix/suffix. You can optionally add a position, and valid values are \u0026quot;prefix\u0026quot; and suffix.\nDefault positions is prefix when formatting a currency and suffix for units.\nExamples:\n\u0026quot;currency\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;NOK\u0026quot;, position: \u0026quot;prefix\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;unit\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;kilogram\u0026quot;, position: \u0026quot;suffix\u0026quot;\nApp developers can choose to leave some of the parts independent of the language. Properties in number overrides dynamic formatting. The configuration below makes prefix display as kr and thousand separator as whitespace. Otherwise in english, prefix would be NOK and thousand separator \u0026quot;,\u0026quot;\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;numberComponent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;formatting\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;currency\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NOK\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;position\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;number\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;thousandSeparator\u0026#34;: \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;kr\u0026#34; } } }, Valid values for currency are ISO 4217 currency codes, such as NOK for Norwegian kroner. List of valid currencies\nValid values for unit are for now the following list:\ncelsius | centimeter | day | degree | foot | gram | hectare | hour | inch | kilogram | kilometer | liter | meter | milliliter | millimeter | millisecond | minute | month | percent | second | week | year\nAligning text in input fields When a schema contains a list of numbers that are automatically summarized, it is common to align text to the right, like when summarizing on paper and how Excel shows numbers. This can be done by setting \u0026quot;align\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;right\u0026quot; under formatting on the input component. Other valid values are \u0026quot;center\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;left\u0026quot;.\nRight aligned numbers { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;numberComponent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;formatting\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;number\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;thousandSeparator\u0026#34;: \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;kr \u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;align\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;right\u0026#34; } }, "

Setup Display of summary is set up in the same manner as the other form components in a form. You can choose to have the summary on it\u0026rsquo;s own page, or on the same page as other form components.\nThe summary component is very simple, and refers to the component that is to be summarized. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;summary1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;komponent-id\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } ] } } The component displays a summary of data from the specified component. In addition, the user gets the opportunity to return to the relevant component/page to make changes.\nThe display differs depending on which form component the summary refers to.\nText resources for summary As stated above, the summary component offers a brief summary of data from another component. However, the following text resources set in the reference component will not be used in the reference component itself but rather in the summary component:\nThe summaryTitle field in textResourceBindings can be utilized to set a label/title specifically for the summary. If this field is set, it will take precedence over the title-field. The summaryAccessibleTitle field in textResourceBindings can be used to define the aria-label for the edit button. By default, the summaryTitle (or title) field is used, but this field allows customization for accessibility purposes in the summary component. { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;summary1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;komponent-id\u0026gt;\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;komponent-id\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;summaryTitle\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Tittel i sammendrag\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;summaryAccessibleTitle\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Aria-label på redigerknapp i sammendrag\u0026#34; }, ... } ] } } Simple form component These are components that are only connected to one field in the data model. E.g. Input, Dropdown, Checkbox/Radio, etc.\nSummary simple form component The summary displays the prompt for the form component and attached data. If there is an active error message attached to the form component, this will also be displayed.\nSummary of simple form component with error Address component This component includes multiple fields. The display is the same as that of a simple form component, so the fields are merged into a simple text.\nSummary of address component, with error File attachments The summary display for file attachments displays a list of the attachments that are uploaded for the component in question.\nSummary file attachment component Groups Pointing to a Group component will display a summary for all components in that group.\nSummary for groups It is also possible to exclude certain (child) components from displaying in the group summary by using the excludedChildren property. This property should be set to an array with component IDs to exclude.\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;main-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hovedgruppe\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;child1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;child2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;child3\u0026#34; ] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;summary-of-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;main-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;excludedChildren\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;child3\u0026#34; ] } ] } } Nested groups Summary is also supported for nested repeating groups. We only support one level of nested groups. In this case, the summary of each element of the group at the top level is displayed as its own category, and the group at the lowest level is displayed in the same manner as a normal repeating group.\nTo support summary display of nested groups, the following setup must be done in the layout-file:\nRefer to the main group in componentRef in the summary component Set \u0026quot;largeGroup\u0026quot;: true on the summary component Example With the following setup of a nested repeating group in layout:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;main-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;RepeatingGroup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hovedgruppe\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model.mainGroup\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;nested-group1\u0026#34; ] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nested-group1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;RepeatingGroup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Undergruppe\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model.mainGroup.subGroup\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;input-field1\u0026#34; ] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-field1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Skriv inn noe her\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model.mainGroup.subGroup.field1\u0026#34; } } ] } } Set up the summary in the following manner:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;summary1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;main-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;largeGroup\u0026#34;: true } ] } } Summary nested repeating group Categories It is possible to group the summaries in different categories to make a summary page more clear.

	"description": "How to update a dialog in Dialogporten",
	"content": "Introduction Updating dialogs as the business process advances, or if any relevant business event occurs, is central to the Dialogporten concept, allowing users to easily keep updated on the process, and end-user systems to immediately react to any business event defined by the service owner, allowing for rich and non-poll-based integrations to internal systems.\nMost fields of the dialog can be changed after dialog creation, with some notable exceptions.\nParty and service resource cannot be changed Created/updated fields cannot be changed Activities and transmissions are non-mutable (ie. existing entries cannot be deleted or changed) Content updates Dialogporten differentiates between \u0026ldquo;content updates\u0026rdquo; and all other updates. A content update is considered any update to\nStatus Extended status Any content-field members, ie. title, summary, additionalInfo, sendersName, extendedStatus or mainContentReference Attachments Actions (both GUI or API) Transmissions Dialogs contain separate fields for the timestamp of the lastest content update (contentUpdatedAt), and for any update (updatedAt). So changes to ie. the activity list will bump the updatedAt field, but not the contentUpdatedAt field. This means that contentUpdatedAt may refer to an earlier point in time than updatedAt. It can never newer than updatedAt, as any change will bump updatedAt.\nEnd-user systems that display lists of dialogs to users are encouraged to sort by contentUpdatedAt in descending order.\nBasic steps Find the dialog you want to update Construct a request body containing the fields you want to updated Send a PUT or PATCH request. Successfull requests return 204 No Content, while user errors (4xx return codes) return a RFC9457 Problem Details reponse body. Using PUT and full request bodies See the reference documentation for details on the request body. Fields supplied that are not present in the PUT DTO definition will be ignored.\nAs the list of transmissions and activities are immutable, you should NOT supply the existing entries, but leave the arrays empty or omit the fields completely unless you intend to add new transmissions and/or activities. Using PATCH for concise updates Dialogporten also supports PATCH operations, which allows a more concise request only containing the fields you want to alter. This can result in smaller request bodies, and can in some cases eliminate the need to GET the dialog first in order to construct the PUT DTO.\nSee the reference documentation for details and examples on how to construct a PATCH request.\nSeparate endpoints for transmissions and activities For a given dialog, the list of transmissions and activities are available on separate resource endpoints:\n/api/v1/serviceowner/dialogs/{dialogId}/transmissions /api/v1/serviceowner/dialogs/{dialogId}/activities These endpoints support POST where individual tranmssions and activities can be added one at a time. POST requests to these endpoints also support concurrency control as described below.\nEach individual transmissions/activity is available by append the transmission-id/activity-id to the above endpoints. Only GET requests are supported for these endpoints.\nConcurrency control with conditional requests To ensure data consistency when updating dialogs, Dialogporten uses optimistic concurrency control based on the ETag header. The ETag value corresponds to the revision field on the dialog object.\nWhen performing an update, include the If-Match header in your request, setting its value to the current ETag of the dialog. This ensures that the update will only succeed if the dialog has not been modified since you last retrieved it.\nExample Retrieve the dialog to get its current ETag value (found in the revision field). Include the If-Match header with the ETag value in your PUT or PATCH request. Sample request with If-Match header: PATCH /api/v1/serviceowner/dialogs/{dialogId} Content-Type: application/json-patch+json If-Match: \u0026#34;86ea8715-05f5-4a4e-8bf7-91840e06dee5\u0026#34; [ { \u0026#34;op\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;replace\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/status\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Completed\u0026#34; } ] If the value supplied in the If-Match-header does not match the current revision id for the supplied dialog, a 412 Precondition Failed response is returned.\nSilent updates In some cases, typically when correcting errors, it is desirable to perform a non-business-process related update to a dialog. These updates work exactly like normal updates, but\nDoes not bump updatedAt or contentUpdatedAt Does not cause Altinn Events to be produced This behaviour can be enabled by added the query parameter ?isSilentUpdate=true to the URL for the POST/PUT/PATCH request.\nRead more\nHow to create a dialog in Dialogporten If-Match header on MDN "

These services support:\nStructured data collection Automatic validation and controls Pre-filled data from public registers File attachments with virus scanning Automatic PDF receipt generation 2. Lookup Services Services that provide users access to existing data without requiring submission of new forms. Typical examples:\nAccess to tax data Overview of permits and rights Case processing status History of previously submitted data 3. Guidance Services Interactive services that guide users through processes to provide tailored answers or recommendations. These services can:\nFunction without login for general inquiries Provide personalized responses based on the user\u0026rsquo;s situation Direct users to the right services or resources Simplify complex regulations 4. Payment Services Apps that include payment functionality for fees, taxes, or other public services:\nIntegrated payment solution Automatic amount calculation Receipt and documentation Payment status tracking 5. Signing Services Services that require electronic signatures for legally valid documents:\nSimple signing by individuals Multi-party signing with defined roles Delegation of signing rights Secure storage of signed documents 6. Coordinated Services Complex services consisting of multiple forms, sub-processes, and involving multiple users:\nWorkflows spanning multiple steps Different user roles with varying permissions Cross-agency integrations Complex process management 7. API-Based Services Services that offer both user interfaces and programmatic access:\nREST API for machine-to-machine communication Support for large data volumes Same data model and validations as web interface Automated data transfer 8. Reporting and Analytics Services Apps that collect data for statistics and analysis:\nPeriodic reports Data collection for research Quality assurance and follow-up Dashboards and visualizations 9. Custom Applications Since each Altinn Studio app is a full-featured ASP.NET Core application, it can be customized for special needs:\nIntegrations with the organization\u0026rsquo;s own systems Custom-tailored user interfaces Advanced business logic Connections to external databases and services Technical Capabilities All these use cases benefit from Altinn Studio\u0026rsquo;s built-in features:\nAccessibility: WCAG and ELMER 3 standards Security: Integrated with ID-porten and Maskinporten Integrations: eFormidling, national registers, data.altinn.no Flexibility: Both low-code and traditional programming Scalability: Cloud-based infrastructure with isolated environments Altinn Studio makes it possible to create everything from simple forms to complex service chains, depending on the organization\u0026rsquo;s needs and ambition level.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "4.1 Necessity and Proportionality We have previously described various types of information processed in Altinn and some of the important societal goals that Altinn and the service owners aim to contribute to.\nWe further refer to the government\u0026rsquo;s digitalization strategy, which states that the work on innovation in the public sector must be intensified, the pace of digitalization of the public sector should increase further, and cooperation with the private sector should be strengthened. Laws and regulations must be adapted to digital solutions.\nOur understanding is also that the overwhelming majority of users want digital solutions and expect them. Altinn\u0026rsquo;s approach to the realization of digital services aims to focus on the user, allowing the user as far as possible to control and take ownership of their own data.\nIn light of the societal goals Altinn and the service owners aim to contribute to, and the government\u0026rsquo;s ambitions for increased digitalization, our assessment is that the processing activities occurring in Altinn are necessary and in reasonable proportion to the purposes.\n4.1.1 Data Minimization In general, digitalized data processing allows for the handling of fewer potential personal data than alternative/previous solutions, for example, by further distribution of entire forms on paper – versus today\u0026rsquo;s possibility to only reuse or redistribute certain data fields.\nHowever, Digdir, as the manager of Altinn, does not have the ability to review and override the service owners\u0026rsquo; legal basis and assessments of which information is necessary for each service.\nFor common functionality in Altinn, assessments have been made of what is necessary, for example, in connection with logging of the user\u0026rsquo;s activities. It is also the case that the use of a public common component like Altinn means that individual public entities do not need to have copies of basic data registers, etc.\n4.1.2 Accuracy The information conveyed through Altinn originates from the authoritative sources of this information; various basic data registers and service owners. These receive their information from the private individuals and the entities the information pertains to. These will therefore have incentives to correct incorrect information registered with these agencies.\nThat the information is obtained from the authoritative sources ensures that Altinn can rely on the accuracy of the information. Reuse of information from basic data registers means that any errors can quickly be discovered by the registered individual, who can then contact the data source to correct the information.\n4.1.3 Storage Limitation and Deletion In the development of new components in Altinn 3, there is a focus on minimizing the storage of personal data. There is a goal to only store one instance of information, and plans to introduce stricter sanitation provisions – unless the registered individual themselves wishes to have the information stored in Altinn for practical reasons.\n4.2 The Registered Individuals\u0026rsquo; Rights 4.2.1 Right to Information and Access As a general rule, the registered individuals should receive information about the processing before it is initiated, cf. GDPR art. 13 and 14. This is largely a duty of information that rests with the data controller who collects the personal data from the registered individual.\nThere are also practical exceptions from the duty of information in art. 14 no. 5, which applies to the processing of personal data not collected from the registered individual.\nAltinn largely acts as a data processor for the service owners, who are data controllers, and therefore is subject to the duty of information in art. 13.\nFor cases where Altinn is the data controller for personal data we ourselves have not collected from the registered individual, for example, in the form of a copy of basic data registers, we consider that the exceptions in art. 14 no. 5 apply.\nNevertheless, Altinn has a privacy statement on its websites, with information about which personal data are processed about the individual.\n4.2.2 Right to Rectification and Erasure Rectification of the information conveyed by Altinn must occur at the source; respectively the managers of the basic data sources or the service owners, according to their regulations/routines for such rectification. If errors occur in common functionality in Altinn, the registered individual can contact Digdir v/ASF.\nThe registered individual has, according to GDPR art. 17, as a starting point the right to have personal data about themselves deleted by the data controller without undue delay under closer conditions, cf. no. 1 letters a to f and no. 2.\n4.2.3 Right to Restriction of Processing According to GDPR art. 18 no. 1, the registered individual, as a main rule, has the right to demand that the processing of personal data be restricted if specific conditions are met.\nIf the processing is restricted after no. 1, the information may be stored and otherwise only processed with the registered individual\u0026rsquo;s consent or for certain purposes, cf. GDPR art. 18 no. 2.\n4.2.4 Right to Data Portability The right to data portability entails two things:\nIndividuals have the right to receive their personal data and to store it on a private device for further personal use. Individuals have the right to move, copy, or transfer their personal data from one entity to another. The personal data that individuals wish to be provided must have been collected by the entity based on consent or contract. The right to data portability further applies only to information that the individual themselves has provided to the entity. Personal data not directly collected from the individual are not covered by this right, according to the Norwegian Data Protection Authority\u0026rsquo;s guide on the right to data portability.\nAltinn collects very limited personal data directly from the registered individual in connection with the common functionality in the solution. This could, for example, involve an email address and phone number in connection with setting up notifications. These are details the registered individual can easily delete or use in other contexts.\nOur assessment is that the registered individual\u0026rsquo;s right to data portability does not apply anyway due to the exception in GDPR art. 20 no. 3 concerning processing necessary for performing tasks in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority.\nFor any right to portability of the personal data collected by the entities using Altinn, the registered individual must directly contact these entities.\n4.2.5 Right to Object The right to object to the processing of personal data does not apply when the data controller can demonstrate that there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override the interests, rights, and freedoms of the registered individual, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, cf. GDPR art. 21 no. 1 and art. 6 no. 1 e).\nDigdir assesses that the processing of personal data occurring in the common functionality in Altinn falls under the aforementioned exceptions.\n4.2.6 Right Not to Be Subject to Automated Individual Decision-making Digdir makes no automated individual decisions in Altinn.\nThe registered individual must exercise their right to object in this context against the individual service owner in Altinn, who is the data controller for their service and the use of personal data in these services.\n4.3 The Registered Individuals\u0026rsquo; Freedoms 4.3.1 Right to Privacy and Confidentiality of Communications Norway\u0026rsquo;s human rights obligations set the outer limits for the level of privacy protection the citizens have.\nNorwegian public entities must base their operations on the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to determine which rights the citizens in Norway are entitled to1.\nFor privacy, ECHR article 8 is the central provision.\nECHR article 8 no. 1 states that \u0026ldquo;Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\u0026rdquo; The right to privacy is encompassed by this provision.\nLike several other human rights, ECHR article 8 does not grant absolute rights. The conditions under which the rights in no. 1, including the right to privacy, can be restricted are detailed in no. 2.\nIt is necessary to distinguish between an interference and a violation. Thus, it must first be assessed whether there is an interference in one or more of the rights in ECHR article 8 no. 1. If there is an interference, it must be checked if this interference fulfills the conditions in ECHR article 8 no. 2. The interference must be \u0026ldquo;in accordance with the law\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;necessary in a democratic society\u0026rdquo; and pursue a legitimate aim. The conditions have been further developed through case law2. The condition \u0026ldquo;necessary in a democratic society\u0026rdquo; expresses a proportionality assessment. In this assessment, the extent to which the other conditions are met and whether they are in proportion to the seriousness of the interference is considered. The greater the interference, the more important it is that mechanisms are in place to safeguard the individual\u0026rsquo;s legal security. There is no violation of the right if the conditions in the second paragraph are met.\nIn the General Data Protection Regulation, the relationship between interference and violation is directly followed from recital 4 and is expressed among other things in the exceptions in the GDPR, see for example article 23. Similar to ECHR article 8 no. 2, interference and exceptions must, in general, be established by law, follow a legitimate aim, and be proportional3.\nThe ECHR obligates the states that have ratified the convention. The obligations involve both negative and positive obligations. Negative obligations mean that states must refrain from actions that result in violations. Positive obligations mean that states must ensure a level of protection that prevents rights from being violated, according to ECHR Article 1. In the following, \u0026ldquo;member state\u0026rdquo; refers to a state that has ratified the ECHR, and \u0026ldquo;third country\u0026rdquo; refers to a state that has not ratified the ECHR.\nDigdir utilizes American cloud services where the location is set to Norway and the EU/EEA.\nWhen a cloud service provider operates in Norway and the EU/EEA, essentially, no data transfer occurs. Therefore, there is no transfer mechanism that a third country\u0026rsquo;s intelligence legislation can be considered in extension of.\nOne might say that the use of cloud services in Norway and the EU/EEA could potentially allow intelligence services from third countries to access information, affecting the right to privacy under ECHR Article 8. Digdir assumes that all countries conduct intelligence activities. A country\u0026rsquo;s intelligence legislation can provide important indications of the risk level. However, the intelligence legislation cannot be decisive. There is still a risk of intelligence activities even if it is not possible to identify the legislation to which the data processor is subject.\nSubsequently, one must assess whether the level of protection that the citizen is entitled to under the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation is fulfilled. This must be assessed specifically. Based on case law, it might be said that relevant elements could include:\nProportionality Legal protection mechanisms that make an intervention more proportional The ability to foresee one\u0026rsquo;s legal position The opportunity to complain The possibility to stop the problematic data processing Whether the Data Protection Authority can impose a stop. Access to courts Digdir assumes that GDPR Article 32 is again the central provision for such an assessment, and in the assessment, it is relevant to see which legal protection mechanisms the registered individual has. We, therefore, refer to the chapters on assessing intelligence risk and the overall assessment of the data processor.\nGenerally, however, it should be noted that consideration is also given to the registered individual\u0026rsquo;s right to privacy by:\nLimitation of purpose Data minimization Disclosure of personal data in registers only to entities with a lawful basis for processing Protection of personal data Limited scope of personal data in logs Digdir, therefore, considers, after a comprehensive assessment, that the processing of personal data for which we are responsible in Altinn 3, does not constitute an intrusion into the registered individual\u0026rsquo;s correspondence, nor into the registered individual\u0026rsquo;s family life and home.\n4.3.2 Protection Against Discrimination and Freedom of Thought, Conscience, and Religion ECHR Article 9 establishes that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice, and observance.\nThe freedom to manifest one\u0026rsquo;s religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\nArticle 14 establishes a prohibition against discrimination. The exercise of the rights and freedoms set forth in the ECHR shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, color, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth, or other status.\nOur assessment is that Altinn, neither by itself nor as a data processor for any of the service owners, discriminates against anyone or restricts anyone\u0026rsquo;s freedom of thought, conscience, or religion.\n4.3.3 Protection of Freedom of Expression and Information Freedom of expression consists of the right to speak and to give or receive information (freedom of information) without interference from authorities. The right to freedom of expression is enshrined in ECHR art. 10, ICCPR art. 19, and in the Norwegian Constitution § 100.\nConsideration is given to the registered individual\u0026rsquo;s right to freedom of expression by enabling the registered individual to exercise their right to request access to registered personal data, as well as to point out errors in the registered information at the data sources.\nAlthough the EU Charter is not part of the EEA Agreement, it can still have significance in the interpretation of other legal sources and thus have indirect significance in EEA law. Halvard H. Fredriksen discusses this in more detail in the article «The Significance of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights for EEA Law».\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSee, for example, the ECHR Big Brother Watch and others.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nSee, for example, the ECHR CENTRUM FÖR RÄTTVISA v. SWEDEN (case no. 35252/08) paragraph 246 et seq. with further references.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"

This enables a similar user experience for end users who do not receive Correspondences via end-user systems, by allowing them to access their Correspondences in the same portal and view as before.\nThe display will be largely similar to the existing display of Altinn 2 Correspondences, and all elements will be shown in the same list, but with some differences.\nNo \u0026ldquo;Archive\u0026rdquo; button Different behavior with delete/trash functionality.

Status changes are synchronized between the solutions, see synchronization for details.\nThe solution is in production, and the last major changes were in Altinn 2 25.4 release, but minor changes might still occur.\nMeasures to ensure gradual increase of load To reduce unnecessary load up-front, the Altinn 2 portal will only call the API endpoints of Altinn 3 Correspondence if a given user/organization has data in Altinn 3 Correspondence. This is handled by setting a flag per user/organization in the Altinn 2 database when Correspondences are created in Altinn 3 Correspondence.\nThis is a similar solution to that used for Forms/submission services and Altinn 3 Apps.\nThis results in a gradual increase in cross-traffic, based on whether data is available from either new services or migrated Correspondences.\nTechnical Implementation A dedicated endpoint is used in the Altinn 3 Correspondence API that caters to the needs of the Altinn 2 Portal; Legacy. New display component in the Altinn 2 Portal for fetching Altinn 3 Correspondences. New flag in the Altinn 2 database per party: PartyHasAltinn3Messages which controls whether the Portal should call Altinn 3 Correspondence when searching. Extension of SBLBridge to set PartyHasAltinn3Messages. Altinn 3 Correspondence calls SBLBridge to set PartyHasAltinn3Messages when a Correspondence is created for a user for the first time (including for migrated Correspondences). "

	"content": "Introduction This guide shows you the ways you can set up a system to detect changes made to dialogs.\nFor a functional overview, see getting started with events.\nThere are two different ways to detect changes; using Altinn Events or GraphQL subscriptions.\nWhen to use Altinn Events You need to detect new dialogs being created You need to be able to detect changes to any number of existing dialogs You are able to either supply a HTTPS endpoint to be used as a webhook for event pushes, or need to poll a Event API for a list of events When to use GraphQL subscriptions You need to be able to monitor a single (or a low number of known) dialog(s) You only need to monitor for a short period of time (typically while a user is present in GUI you\u0026rsquo;re building) You need low latency You are able to handle a websocket connection or server sent events via HTTP If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure, you probably want Altinn Events\nHow to subscribe to Altinn Events Please refer to the Altinn Event component documentation for a generic guide on how to get started either subscribing via webook (recommended) or polling the event API for events.\nFor technical information on the various event types and formats produced by Dialogporten, see the technical reference for events.\nHow to Use GraphQL Subscriptions This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of GraphQL operations and focuses on setting up and using subscriptions. If you need more detailed instructions on setting up the initial GraphQL client, please refer to the documentation of your library/client SDK of choice.\nBefore you can set up a GraphQL subscription, you must fetch the dialog details to obtain the necessary dialog token. This token is crucial for authorization when setting up the subscription.\nStep-by-Step Guide Fetch Dialog Details\nObtain the dialog you want to monitor. This can usually be done through a GraphQL query or by utilizing a REST API endpoint. For more details on how to do this, refer to our guide on getting dialog details.\nSet Up the Subscription\nOnce you have the dialog token, you can set up the subscription to the dialogEvents. Use the dialogId of the dialog you are interested in to subscribe to events related to it. Here’s how you can write the subscription query:\nsubscription { dialogEvents(dialogId: \u0026#34;your-dialog-id-here\u0026#34;) { id type } } Ensure to include the Digdir-Dialog-Token in the HTTP headers for the request:\n\u0026#34;Digdir-Dialog-Token\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your-dialog-token-here\u0026#34; Handle Incoming Events\nWith the subscription active, the server will push updates to your client every time there is an change associated with the dialog ID you subscribed to. Events could be either DIALOG_DELETED or DIALOG_UPDATED. You will receive payloads structured as follows:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;dialogEvents\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;uuid-of-the-dialog\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;DIALOG_DELETED\u0026#34; // Or \u0026#34;DIALOG_UPDATED\u0026#34; } } } "

To achieve a nice workflow for developing, dialogue is essential.\nIn this dialogue we will:\nDiscover what needs the component should meet, and discuss the solution Identify any shortcomings in the design or technical solution that needs to be overcome Decide if we should help you with design or user testing Development handbook All information you need to get started is included in our development handbook. The handbook includes information on how to write consistent code and build new components.\nAccessibility testing Apps built on Altin 3 must be accessible for everyone, and to ensure that this is the case we follow the WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Please see the demands described at the Norwegian Authority for Universal Design of ICT or a11yproject.\nReview of component When a pull request is made we will do a review of your component. Hopefully we have already agreed how the component should be made before development started, thus reducing the need for large changes at this stage.\nTesting WCAG testing Code review Design review If we do find something that needs improvement, we will contact you about further development.\n"

By supplying the dialog token, it is possible to do a single, direct request to a remote endpoint, which then can authenticate and authorize the request, and return the content directly back to the frontend to render and embed within the user interface.\nThe service provider system will have to implement support for front channel embeds to handle front channel embeds and web browser security mechanisms (CORS protocol). More information about this in the reference section.\nRead more\nHandling front channel embeds in dialog details Reference information about front channel embeds "

	"content": " Select environment: Production Staging (TT02) Dev Local dev Help This dropdown lets you select which Dialogporten environment the content of this page should be based on. If unsure, use the default \"Staging (TT02)\", as this is the environment you would normally test against when integrating Dialogporten. For bleeding edge, select \"Dev\", as this contains the most recent unreleased changes to the Dialogporten API. Select \"Local dev\" if you want to test changes to Dialogporten itself running locally. Dismiss Introduction Service owners might want to offer custom views for Dialogporten data in their own portals. While it is possible for a service owner to authenticate as a end-user system, this has both usability and GDPR drawbacks as it 1) requires the user to handle a consent dialog in ID-porten to grant the system access, and 2) grants the service owner access to user dialogs belonging to other service owners.\nTo alleviate this, Dialogporten offers a way to utilize the (already employed) service owner authentication and additionally supplying a end-user id to further filter the available dialogs. This results in a list of dialogs created by the service owner which the end user has access to, eliminating the need for a ID-porten consent and avoids that the service owner gets access to any other dialogs that the user might have access to.\nBasic steps Authenticate against Dialogporten as a service owner system Authenticate the end-user in the service owner portal (via ID-porten or other means) Construct a end-user id (typically urn:altinn:person:identifier-no:\u0026lt;11 digit norwegian identifier number\u0026gt;) Perform a call to /api/v1/serviceowner/dialogs/?endUserId=urn:altinn:person:identifier-no:\u0026lt;11 digit norwegian identifier number\u0026gt;\u0026amp;Party=...\u0026amp;ServiceResource=...\u0026amp;\u0026lt;other filter parameters\u0026gt; Searching for dialogs Note than when impersonating users, the restrictions for the end-user API also apply here - notably that serviceResource and/or party must be supplied.\nReturned information See the dialog search DTO for full details.\nGetting dialog details Returned information See the dialog details DTO for service owner for full details.\n"

	"content": "Instance The Instance model is the main model of an instance. An instance can be regarded as an envelope or folder where data is collected and exchanged between the application user and owner. The instance document is a way for Altinn and external parties to track the state of one specific data exchange.\nProperties Name Description id A gobally unique id for the instance. The value has two parts separated by a \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; character. The first part is the internal unique id of the instance owner and the second part is a generated UUID value. instanceOwner A complex type identifying the owner of the instance. See InstanceOwner appId The id for the app the instance is associated with. The value has two parts separated by a \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; character. The first part is the short name/identifier of the owner of the app and the second part is the app name. org The short name of the app owner. selfLinks A complex type containing a set of named URLs. See ResourceLinks dueBefore This can be use by app owner to indicate a deadline for when the instance must be completed and submitted by a user that can represent the instance owner. visibleAfter This can be used by app owner to have an instance become visible for app users at a given date and time. This way an instance can be created in advance and populated with data before being available to an application user. process A complex type tracking the process state of the instance. See ProcessState status A complex type with more state data. See InstanceStatus completeConfirmations A list of complete confirmations. See CompleteConfirmation data A list of data elements. This include all forms, attachments and other data types being collected. See DataElement presentationTexts A dictionary with text values extracted from forms that are saved on the instance. Values are extracted based on PresentationField values stored in the application metadata document. Also see PresentationField dataValues A dictionary with data values extracted from forms that are saved on the instance. Values are extracted based on configured data fields in the applicationmetadata document. Also see DataField created The date and time when the instance was first initialized. createdBy An idenfificator indicating who it was that created the instance. lastChanged The date and time when the instance was last changed. lastChangedBy An idenfificator indicating who it was that made the last change to the instance. InstanceOwner The InstanceOwner model is a simple definition whose only purpose is to hold a universally known identification value of the instance owner.\nProperties Name Description partyId A value used internally by Altinn to uniquely identify an entity across Organisations, Persons and Self identified users. personNumber If the instance owner is a person this field is populated with a person number from the National Population Register in Norway. organisationNumber If the instance owner is an organisation this field is populated with an organisation number from the National Unit Register in Norway. username If the instance owner is a self identified user this field is populated with a user name. InstanceStatus The InstanceStatus model is used to hold key status related metadata about an instance. All information is also tracked through instance events, but this is an easily accessible summary of the last events.\nProperties Name Description archived The date and time for when an archived instance was archived. softDeleted The date and time for when a deleted instance were moved to the recycle bin. hardDeleted The date and time for when an instance became unrecoverable through any API. A few days later the instance and all its data will be physically deleted from storage and truly unrecoverable. readStatus A field indicating whether an application user has opened the instance at any time. Used internally by the message box to indicate read status of elements. substatus A property with human readable status information that will be displayed by the message box. CompleteConfirmation The CompleteConfirmation model is a simple type for holding information about who and when a given stakeholder has told Altinn that the instance is no longer needed. They have obtained all the information they needed from the instance. The instance can be deleted permanently should an application user decide to to so. At the time of writing an instance can have only one stakeholder and that is the Application Owner.\nDataValues Data values are values either extracted from the instance data or other sources. The values are stored with the instance for easy access and can be used for example in routing logic on the receiving end.\nWhile data fields configured in the app metadata file will be extracted and automatically picked up by the application, there is also the option of adding values manually by using the UpdateDataValues method from the IInstance interface. You can mix and match data fields from configuration and by manually adding. It\u0026rsquo;s the UpdateDataValues method that is called under the hood in both cases. UpdateDataValues merges the incoming collection with what\u0026rsquo;s already stored. However if yo specify the same id it will be overwritten by one or the other and you have no guaranties on which is stored.\nValues passed in to the UpdateDataValues can have any source and is not restricted to data stored in the application. It can be called from any place but it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to not call it more than strictly required. A good place is to override the RunProcessTaskEnd method from AppBase causing the method to be called when a task is completed.\nProperties Name Description stakeholderId The short name of an application owner. confirmedOn The date and time for when the application owner confirmed that they consider the instance as no longer needed in Altinn. ProcessState The process state model keeps track of the process of a specific instance.\nProperties Name Description started Date and time for when the process was initially started. startEvent The name of the start event triggering the beginning of the process. currentTask A complex model keeping track of current process step. See ProcessElementInfo ended Date and time for when the process was finished. endEvent The name of the end event that the process ended with. ProcessElementInfo The process element info holds information about the current task in the process.\nProperties Name Description flow A step counter that increase every time the process moves forward. started Date and time for when the instance entered the current step. elementId The unique id of current process task. name The name of the task. (Human readable.) altinnTaskType The type of task. validated A date and time for when the instance was validated as well as a value indicating if the task can be completed without additional changes and a new validation. ResourceLinks The resource link model is should have a collection of URLs that can be used to obtain a copy of the instance document through different API. The propose is to make it easy to switch between API. Primarily when the original was obtain from the storage instance query API and you need to use the app API to perform changes on the instance.\nProperties Name Description apps Contains a URL for the endpoint to use to obtain a copy of the current instance document through the app API. platform Contains a URL for the endpoint to use to obtain a copy of the current instance document through the Platform Storage API. Complete example This example was created by instantiating an app running locally on a development machine using LocalTest. The process is at first step, Task_1, and it has a single data element which is the main form of the app.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instanceOwner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;partyId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;personNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;01039012345\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organisationNumber\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;: null }, \u0026#34;appId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd/bli-applikasjonseier\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;org\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selfLinks\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;apps\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://local.altinn.cloud/ttd/bli-applikasjonseier/instances/1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://local.altinn.cloud/storage/api/v1/instances/1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dueBefore\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;visibleAfter\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;process\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;started\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-18T15:56:41.5662973Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;startEvent\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;StartEvent_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;currentTask\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;flow\u0026#34;: 2, \u0026#34;started\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-18T15:56:41.5664762Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;elementId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Utfylling\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;altinnTaskType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ended\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;validated\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-20T13:00:05.1800273+00:00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;canCompleteTask\u0026#34;: true } }, \u0026#34;ended\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;endEvent\u0026#34;: null }, \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;completeConfirmations\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8a8a01ae-9533-4aa9-b914-8ab0fae6ea0d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instanceGuid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Kursdomene_BliTjenesteeier_M_2020-05-25_5703_34553_SERES\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;filename\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;contentType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blobStoragePath\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd/bli-applikasjonseier/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814/data/8a8a01ae-9533-4aa9-b914-8ab0fae6ea0d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selfLinks\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;apps\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://local.altinn.cloud/ttd/bli-applikasjonseier/instances/1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814/data/8a8a01ae-9533-4aa9-b914-8ab0fae6ea0d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://local.altinn.cloud/storage/api/v1/instances/1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814/data/8a8a01ae-9533-4aa9-b914-8ab0fae6ea0d\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: 401, \u0026#34;locked\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;refs\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;created\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-18T15:56:43.1089008Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;createdBy\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;lastChanged\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-18T15:56:43.1089008Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChangedBy\u0026#34;: null } ], \u0026#34;created\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-18T15:56:42.1972942Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;createdBy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChanged\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-18T15:56:42.1972942Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChangedBy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337\u0026#34; } "

	"content": " To use notifications in Altinn Correspondence, a notification order is placed when a message is created. The notification will be sent out 5 minutes after the publication time of the message. If the publication time is in the past, the notification will be sent 5 minutes after the current time. If a reminder is activated, the reminder will be sent after 7 days if the message has not been read. In the test and staging environment, the reminder will be sent out after 1 day if the message has not been read.\nNote: The reminder timing in test and staging environments is currently set to 1 day due to limitations in the notification service. This is a temporary change, and work is in progress to restore the previous 1-hour delay. Notifications can be sent via either email or SMS. While email does not have a time window, SMS notifications are sent between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM. If the sending time falls outside this window, the notification will be sent the following day.\nIn the test environment, you can only send SMS notifications to whitelisted phone numbers.\nSend an email to tjenesteeier@altinn.no with the phone number that needs to be whitelisted. A notification order is made by adding the following when initializing a message:\n{ \u0026#34;correspondence\u0026#34;: { ..., \u0026#34;notification\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;notificationTemplate\u0026#34;: CustomMessage (0) | GenericAltinnMessage(1), \u0026#34;notificationChannel\u0026#34;: Email(0) | Sms(1) | EmailPreferred(2) | SmsPreferred(3) | EmailAndSms(4), \u0026#34;sendReminder\u0026#34;: boolean, \u0026#34;emailBody\u0026#34;: string?, \u0026#34;emailSubject\u0026#34;: string?, \u0026#34;emailContentType\u0026#34;: Plain(0) | Html(1), \u0026#34;smsBody\u0026#34;: string?, \u0026#34;reminderNotificationChannel\u0026#34;: Email(0) | Sms(1) | EmailPreferred(2) | SmsPreferred(3) | EmailAndSms(4), \u0026#34;reminderEmailBody\u0026#34;: string?, \u0026#34;reminderEmailSubject\u0026#34;: string?, \u0026#34;reminderEmailContentType\u0026#34;: Plain(0) | Html(1), \u0026#34;reminderSmsBody\u0026#34;: string?, \u0026#34;requestedSendTime\u0026#34;: DateTimeOffset?, \u0026#34;customRecipients\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;organizationNumber\u0026#34;: string?, \u0026#34;nationalIdentityNumber\u0026#34;: string?, \u0026#34;mobileNumber\u0026#34;: string?, \u0026#34;emailAddress\u0026#34;: string? } ], \u0026#34;overrideRegisteredContactInformation\u0026#34;: boolean } }, \u0026#34;Recipients\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;ExistingAttachments\u0026#34;:{...} } Field Validation and Character Limits When creating notifications, the following validation rules and character limits apply.

Supported for all scenarios $correspondenceRecipientName$ Will be supplied with the correspondence recipient\u0026rsquo;s name, which will be either the organization\u0026rsquo;s name or a person\u0026rsquo;s name Supported for all scenarios $recipientName$ Will be supplied with the notification recipient\u0026rsquo;s name, which will be either the organization\u0026rsquo;s name or a person\u0026rsquo;s name Is not supported for customRecipients when notifications are sent to an email address or a phone number $recipientNumber$ If the recipient is an organization, it will be supplied with the organization number, otherwise it will be left empty Is not supported for customRecipients when notifications are sent to an email address or a phone number $messageTitle$ Will be supplied with the title of the correspondence Supported for all scenarios $resourceName$ Will be supplied with the name of the resource Supported for all scenarios Notification Templates Two types of notification templates are offered when using notifications through the Correspondence API.\nCustomText:\nThe entire message is written by the sender and sent in full to the recipient. GenericAltinnMessage:\nA generic Altinn text with the option to supplement with additional text. Currently supported languages are Norwegian, Nynorsk, and English. The language is chosen based on the language defined in the message. This notification text has been prepared by Altinn User Support and contains information that will be valuable to the end user. Altinn therefore recommends that service owners use this template. Title: A new message is available in Altinn for $correspondenceRecipientName$ Content: Hi. $correspondenceRecipientName$ $recipientNumber$ has received a new message $messageTitle$ from $sendersName$. (To see this message you need access to $resourceName$.) Log in to Altinn to see this message.\nReminder Title: Reminder - a message is available in Altinn for $correspondenceRecipientName$ Reminder Content: Hi. This is a reminder that $correspondenceRecipientName$ $recipientNumber$ has received a message $messageTitle$ from $sendersName$. (To see this message you need access to $resourceName$.) Log in to Altinn to see this message.\nSMS uses only the content, not the title. Note! Links should NEVER be sent in notifications!\nNotification Channels Supported notification channels:\nEmail: Sends an email to the recipient. SMS: Sends an SMS to the recipient. Supports both national and international phone numbers. EmailPreferred: Uses email as the main communication channel, and SMS as a fallback if email is not available. SmsPreferred: Uses SMS as the main communication channel, and email as a fallback if SMS is not available. EmailAndSms: Sends both email and SMS to the recipient simultaneously. The first notification and the reminder notification can use different notification channels. For example, the first notification is sent by email, while the reminder notification seven days later is sent by SMS. Cancellation of Notification If a message is deleted before the publication date, the notification order will also be deleted. In situations where an error occurs during the publication of a message, the notification will also be deleted.\nErrors in Notification Ordering If no contact information is available for a recipient, the message will still be sent as planned. Information about the notification can be viewed by retrieving the details about the specific correspondence. Improvements are planned to provide feedback on this during the creation of a message.\nCustom recipients for Notifications For all correspondences created with Notifications enabled, the notifications will be sent to the recipient specified in the creation of the correspondence. However, it is also possible to choose additional recipients of the notification that are not necessarily the recipient(s) of the correspondence. In practice this means that custom recipients will receive notifications in addition to the original correspondence recipient.\nUsing customRecipients (Recommended) The recommended approach is to use the customRecipients field under notification to specify multiple recipients:\n{ \u0026#34;notification\u0026#34;: { ..., \u0026#34;customRecipients\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;organizationNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nationalIdentityNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mobileNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;emailAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;organizationNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nationalIdentityNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mobileNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;emailAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; } ] } } Note: Notifications will be sent to both the default correspondence recipient AND all custom recipients listed above.\n⚠️ DEPRECATED: The customRecipient field is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use customRecipients instead. Using customRecipient (Deprecated) For backward compatibility, you can still use the customRecipient field for a single recipient:\n{ \u0026#34;notification\u0026#34;: { ..., \u0026#34;customRecipient\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;organizationNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nationalIdentityNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mobileNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;emailAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; } } } ⚠️ DEPRECATED: The customNotificationRecipients field is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Please use customRecipients instead. Using customNotificationRecipients (Deprecated) This can be achieved by populating the customNotificationRecipients field under notification as follows:\n{ \u0026#34;notification\u0026#34;: { ..., \u0026#34;customNotificationRecipients\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;recipientToOverride\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;recipients\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;organizationNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nationalIdentityNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mobileNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;emailAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; } ] } ] } } Validation Rules for Custom Recipients When using custom recipients, the following validation rules apply:\nAdditional Recipients: Custom recipients are sent notifications in addition to the default correspondence recipient, not instead of them.\nSingle Recipient Only: If custom recipients are specified, the correspondence must have only one default recipient (not multiple recipients).\nSingle Identifier Required: Each custom recipient must have exactly one identifier field populated:\norganizationNumber (for organizations) nationalIdentityNumber (for persons) emailAddress (for direct email notifications) mobileNumber (for direct SMS notifications) Keyword Restrictions: When using emailAddress or mobileNumber, the $recipientName$ keyword cannot be used in any notification content (email subject, email body, SMS body, reminder fields) because name lookup is not available for direct contact information.\nFormat Validation:\nEmail addresses: Must be in valid email format (e.g., user@example.com) Mobile numbers: Must adhere to E.164 standard and be valid phone numbers. Can start with + or 00 for international format. Norwegian numbers starting with 4 or 9 will automatically get +47 prefix if no country code is provided. Organization Numbers: Must be in format 0192:organizationnumber or urn:altinn:organizationnumber:organizationnumber National Identity Numbers: Must be valid 11-digit Norwegian social security numbers How to use it For recommended approach (multiple recipients):\ncorrespondence.notification.customRecipients[0].organizationNumber correspondence.notification.customRecipients[0].nationalIdentityNumber correspondence.notification.customRecipients[0].mobileNumber correspondence.notification.customRecipients[0].emailAddress correspondence.notification.customRecipients[1].organizationNumber // ... additional recipients For deprecated single recipient approach:\ncorrespondence.notification.customRecipient.organizationNumber correspondence.notification.customRecipient.nationalIdentityNumber correspondence.notification.customRecipient.mobileNumber correspondence.notification.customRecipient.emailAddress For deprecated multiple recipients approach:\ncorrespondence.notification.customNotificationRecipients[0].recipientToOverride correspondence.notification.customNotificationRecipients[0].recipients[0].organizationNumber correspondence.notification.customNotificationRecipients[0].recipients[0].nationalIdentityNumber correspondence.notification.customNotificationRecipients[0].recipients[0].mobileNumber correspondence.notification.customNotificationRecipients[0].recipients[0].emailAddress ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Both notificationTemplate and notificationChannel are applicable when using custom recipients:\nnotificationTemplate: Determines the content (email subject, body, SMS body) that will be sent to the custom recipient notificationChannel: For organization and person custom recipient, this determines the channel(s) the notification(s) are sent to. For direct email/mobile custom recipients, the channel is not applicable any more. Further details are provided here.\nOverride Default Recipient Behavior By default, when using custom recipients, notifications are sent to both the default correspondence recipient AND all custom recipients. However, you can override this behavior using the overrideRegisteredContactInformation flag.\nUsing overrideRegisteredContactInformation The overrideRegisteredContactInformation flag allows you to control whether the default correspondence recipient should be included in notifications:\n{ \u0026#34;notification\u0026#34;: { ..., \u0026#34;customRecipients\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;organizationNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nationalIdentityNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mobileNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;emailAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;overrideRegisteredContactInformation\u0026#34;: true } } Behavior overrideRegisteredContactInformation: false (default): Notifications are sent to the default correspondence recipient AND all custom recipients overrideRegisteredContactInformation: true: Notifications are sent ONLY to custom recipients (default correspondence recipient is excluded) Validation Rules Custom Recipients Required: The overrideRegisteredContactInformation flag can only be set to true when customRecipients is provided and not empty Default Value: If not specified, overrideRegisteredContactInformation defaults to false Example Use Cases Scenario 1: Additional Recipients (Default Behavior)\n{ \u0026#34;notification\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;customRecipients\u0026#34;: [{\u0026#34;organizationNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;123456789\u0026#34;}], \u0026#34;overrideRegisteredContactInformation\u0026#34;: false } } Result: Notifications sent to both the default correspondence recipient AND the custom organization\nScenario 2: Override Default Recipient\n{ \u0026#34;notification\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;customRecipients\u0026#34;: [{\u0026#34;organizationNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;123456789\u0026#34;}], \u0026#34;overrideRegisteredContactInformation\u0026#34;: true } } Result: Notifications sent ONLY to the custom organization (default correspondence recipient excluded)\n"

	"description": "How to set up code lists for components that use options",
	"content": "Several of the form components in Altinn 3 use options. By options, we mean a list of choices that can be selected by the user. In the most basic use cases you might set up a list of options directly in the component configuration, but often you\u0026rsquo;ll want to fetch the options from a code list.\nTerms There are subtle differences between the terms options and code lists:\nOptions: A list of choices that can be selected by the user. As an example, think of the contacts in your phone. When you use your contact list to call someone, you are selecting from a list of options, and your phone uses the selected value (the phone number) to call the person. Code list: A list of codes and their corresponding value and texts. This can for example be the ISO 3166-1 country codes. This list contains codes (like NO or SE) and their corresponding labels (like Norway or Sweden). When selecting a value from (for example) a Dropdown component, you are selecting from a list of options, which might be sourced from a code list. In that case, options is what they are, and a code list is where they came from.\nSupported components The following components support options:\nComponent Type Use case Dropdown Single choice Used to select a single option from a dropdown list. RadioButtons Single choice Used to select a single option from a list of radio buttons. List Single choice Used to select a single option from a list/table (with one radio button per row). Likert Single choice per row Used to select a single option per row in a table, displayed as a scale. Commonly used in surveys. Checkboxes Multiple choice Used to select one or more options from a list of checkboxes. MultipleSelect Multiple choice Used to select one or more options from a dropdown list. FileUploadWithTag Single choice Used to upload a file and tag it with an option. Option Present single option Used to present/display a single option. In the categories below, you can learn more about how to produce a code list, configure that list to be used in a component in order to provide options in that component, as well as common functionality across the previously mentioned components that support options.\nSourcesThe different sources for options in Altinn Studio\nFunctionalityCommon functionality for all option sources\n"

Det er også her man styrer CPU og minne allokering. Du finner Chart.yamlog values.yamli deployment mappen i applikasjonen din. Dette er viktige filer som kan være lett å overse og ikke ha et aktivt forhold til.\nTips 1 - Kjør siste versjon av Helm Chart Med siste versjon får du de mest oppdaterte innstillingene som standard. Se Endringslogg for deployment for hvordan oppgradere til siste versjon.\nTips 2 - Ha et aktivt forhold til hva applikasjonen krever av minne og CPU Altinn kommer med en standard på 50m CPU og 128Mi minne, men hva som faktisk kreves er det jo bare den som utvikler en applikasjon som vet. Hvis det caches mye data, vil det kreve mye minne. Hvis det er tunge operasjoner så vil det kreve mye CPU. De faktiske kravene bør gjenspeiles i Helm Chart hvis de avviker fra standarden.\nTips 3 - Reduser antall instanser i testmiljø Trenger man 2 kjørende instanser i test eller kan man klare seg med 1? Ønsker man å teste hvordan en app oppfører seg med flere instanser så trenger man nødvendigvis 2 eller flere, men ofte så holder det men 1 kjørende instans i test og man tåler litt nedetid ved deploy.\nMerk: Har man gjort de tiltakene man kan, men alikevel har nådd taket på hva clusteret håndterer så er neste steg å øke antallet noder evt. ha kraftigere noder. Ta kontakt med oss i Altinn så ser vi på dette sammen med dere.\n"

	"description": "Guidelines for using Redux in Altinn Studio",
	"content": "Redux is used to manage the states of the applications. The components update the states in the Redux store, instead of keeping state only within the component. This allows components to easily react to state changes from other components.\nRedux Toolkit As of 2021, we have started using Redux Toolkit rather than the traditional Redux setup. This allows us to get rid of a lot of boilerplate code. Read more about Redux Toolkit here.\nIn practice, this affects the setup of actions and reducers. We currently use Redux Toolkit in Altinn Studio, and plan to update the App frontend as well. Redux Toolkit also works well in parallel with the more traditional setup. In App frontend, any new reducers should be set up as slices where possible, using Redux Toolit. New actions can be set up using the createAction method, rather than the existing boilerplate setup.\ncreateAction React more about creating actions here. Actions can also be created automatically within slices. The createAction command is useful for actions that are are not necessarily handled by the reducer.\ncreateSlice Read more about slices here. Slices combine the creation of actions and reducers into one command, thereby reducing the amount of code, as well as making the setup much more readable.\nDispatching actions In the traditional setup, we use an action dispatcher. For App frontend, it is possible to combine f.ex. createAction with existing action dispatchers. Where possible, however, actions should be dispatched using the dispatch function, from the component itself. For class components, this function is provided as a prop from mapStateToProps. For functional components using hooks, we can use const dispatch = useDispatch() where the useDispatch function comes from the react-redux package.\nExamples For examples of Redux Toolkit setup in the code, look at the Studio code, where all actions/reducers/dispatching has been updated to use Redux Toolkit.\nBasic concepts Below is a short descriptions of some of the basic Redux concepts that we use. Note that these are described using the traditional Redux setup and not Redux Toolkit, but the concepts are the same in both cases.\nStore This is where the overall states are stored. Each state is stored here as an object.\nActions Actions are the events that are triggered when a change is made. An action contains the action type, and any metadata needed to complete the action. For example:\nexport interface IUpdateFormData extends Action { field: string; data: any; componentId: string; } export function updateFormData(field: string, data: any, componentId: string): IUpdateFormData { return { type: actionTypes.UPDATE_FORM_DATA, field, data, componentId, }; } In this example, a change in form data can trigger the updateFormData action, which contains an object with the action type, as well as the data/metadata.\nSagas Redux saga is the middleware used to process information before the store is updated (i.e. before the reducer does its work).\nAn example is asyncronous calls to backend APIs to get data, or submit data.\nEach saga defines methods that complete different tasks, connected to actions. These methods are called via listeners that listen to the actions that are being dispatched. There are different sagas for all the different functional areas.\n/** * Define the saga for the UPDATE_FORM_DATA event */ function* updateFormDataSaga(action: ActionType) { try { // fetch some data const relevantData = yield selectRelevantStateObjects(...); ... // process the data const processedData = doRelevantLogic(relevantData); ... // trigger a new action to update the store yield call(updateFormDataSagaFulfilled, processedData, ... ); } catch (err) { yield call(updateFormDataSagaRejected, err); } } /** * Define a listener for the UPDATE_FORM_DATA event */ export function* watchUpdateFormDataSaga(): SagaIterator { yield takeLatest(FormFillerActionTypes.UPDATE_FORM_DATA, updateFormDataSaga); } Reducers Redux reducers are used to update the different states in the store. There is one reduer per state. The reducers listen to the actions that are dispatched when changes are made, and update the state accordingly.\nExample:\nconst initialState: IFormDataState = { formData: {}, error: null, }; const FormDataReducer: Reducer\u0026lt;IFormDataState\u0026gt; = ( state: IFormDataState = initialState, action?: Action, ): IFormDataState =\u0026gt; { if (!action) { return state; } switch (action.type) { case actionTypes.UPDATE_FORM_DATA_FULFILLED: { const { field, data } = action as IUpdateFormDataFulfilled; return Immutable\u0026lt;IFormDataState\u0026gt;(state, { formData: { $setField: { field, data, }, }, }); } case actionTypes.UPDATE_FORM_DATA_REJECTED: { const { error } = action as IUpdateFormDataRejected; return Immutable\u0026lt;IFormDataState\u0026gt;(state, { error: { $set: error, }, }); } default: { return state; } } }; export default FormDataReducer; "

Man kan spesifisere fraksjoner og enten spesifisere 0.1 eller 100m (som leses hundre millicores). Vi anbefaler at man benytter m notasjonen og ikke desimal notasjonen slik at man skriver 1m og ikke 0.001 (som er det minste man kan spesifisere).\nSom standard har man 12 kjerner til fordeling i TT02, dvs. 12 000m, gitt dagens oppsett med 6 noder á 2 kjerner. Fra dette må vi trekke fra de systemtekniske containerne som kubernetes selv kjører, det tilsvarer ca. 30% av CPU, da er vi nede i 8000m til fordeling til Altinn 3 applikasjoner.\nFor en app er CPU satt som default til 50m. Dvs. man skal i teorien ha plass til 8000 / 50m = 160 apps på et slikt cluster. Men en app vil som standard kjøres opp i 2 instanser, da har vi brukt 2x50m=100m. I tillegg har hver app en såkalt sidecar container (Linkerd for kryptering/dekryptering) som får 25m. Denne følger instansen og det blir da 2x25=50m. Så en app vil da totalt kreve 150m for 2 instanser. Gitt 8 cpu’er tilgjengelig så får vi 53 apps med dagens oppsett. Dette er veiledende tall, men gir en grei pekepinn. Hvis en app krever mer CPU enn minimum vil den få det gitt at det finnes mer tilgjengelig.\nMinne Minne spesifiseres i byte, og man kan benytte ulike suffixer som Mi, M Ki etc. Altinn 3 spesifiserer dette i Mi som er Mebibyte som er tilnærmet det samme som Megabyte.\nSom standard har vi 48GiB (Gibi Byte) minne tilgjengelig i clusteret totalt, men dette er fordelt med 8GiB på hver av de 6 nodene. Fra dette må vi trekke fra ca. 0.5 - 1GiB som går til systemtekniske containere som kubernetes selv kjører, det tilsvarer ca. 10-20%. Dvs. at vi da har 6 noder x 7Mi = 42GiB (40054Mi) totalt i clusteret og 7GiB (7168Mi) per. Node til fordeling.\nFor en app er minne satt til 128Mi som default. Dvs. man skal i teorien ha plass til 7168Mi / 128Mi = 56 app instanser per node og 336 apps totalt i clusteret hvis vi kun ser på minne. Når vi ser på tallene over minneforbruk så er det et overforbruk av minne, så 256Mi er nok et bedre tall per app. Korrigert for dette så kan vi halvere tallene slik at det blir 24 app instanser per node og 168 app instanser totalt i clusteret.\nHvordan fungerer ressursallokering i clusteret? Når en ny app skal deployes til et Kubernetes cluster vil Kubernetes litt forenklet se på hvor mye minne og CPU det er spurt om som minimum og prøve å finne node som har ledig plass. Hvis den ikke finner en node med ledig plass så vil den se om det er noen av de kjørende applikasjonene som overforbruker ressurser i forhold til hva de har spurt om å kaste ut den eller de som har høyest overforbruk for å gi plass til den nye.\nMerk: Det at Kubernetes vil kaste ut en applikasjon som overforbruker gjør det svært viktig å ha et forhold til hvor mye ressurser man har tilgjengelig, hvor mye hver enkelt app krever og at summen av dette går opp - hvis ikke risikerer man ustabilitet i miljøet.\n"

	"content": "Altinn 3 applikasjoner for en tjenesteeier kjører i Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) fra Microsoft Azure. Dette er en såkalt Managed Service hvor vi lar Microsoft Azure ta seg av den underliggende driften av Kubernetes clusteret. Altinn står for konfigurering og provisjonering av clusteret, mens tjenesteeier har selv ansvar for utrulling av applikasjonene til clusteret.\nFor detaljert dokumentasjon av hvilke muligheter som finnes må man se på:\nAzure Kubernetes Services Kubernetes, og da spesielt hvordan ressurser administreres - et ansvar som er delt mellom Altinn og tjenesteeier. Alle tjenesteeiere vil ha egne Kubernetes cluster for test og produksjon. Dette sikrer at applikasjoner for en tjenesteeier ikke påvirker applikasjoner for andre tjenesteeiere.\nRessursadministrasjon Selv om man ofte tenker at en skyløsning har ubegrenset kapasitet, så vil også ubegrenset kapasitet gjerne føre til ubegrenset kostnadsbruk. Det er derfor viktig å ha kontroll på hva man forbruker av ressurser, hvor mange applikasjoner man kjører og hvor mye CPU/minne den enkelte applikasjon legger beslag på. Før eller siden vil man gå tom for ressurser (CPU og minne) på clusteret, og det er da viktig å forstå hvilke faktorer som påvirker.\nKomponentene i et cluster Et AKS Cluster kjører på et antall noder (virtuelle maskiner) av en gitt type. Per i dag er dette B2 som har 2 vCPU og 8 GiB minne. Som standard settes det opp minimum 3 noder både i TT02 og produksjon med automatisk skalering opp til 6 noder avhengig av trafikk. Clusteret vil da ha 12 vCPU og 48 GiB minne som da blir den øvre kapasiteten clusteret har til å betjene de applikasjonene som til enhver tid er deployet.\nMerk: Et cluster kan skaleres automatisk opp til 1000 noder, men dette vil også medføre tilsvarende kostnadsøkning. Hva som er det rette \u0026ldquo;taket\u0026rdquo; for den enkelte tjensteeier vil avhenge av antall applikasjoner, hvor mye ressurser disse krever som minimum og trafikken som disse genererer. Ta kontakt med oss i Altinn om dere har behov for mer ressurser enn det som er satt opp som standard.\nFullscreen\nApplikasjoner / Apps Når vi snakker om en Altinn 3 App så snakker vi om den logiske applikasjonen som det bare finnes 1 av. For å sikre at en app hele tiden er oppe så kjører vi som regel med 2 eller flere instanser av applikasjonen. Minne og CPU reservasjoner gjelder per instans.\nDocker Containers En Docker Container, eller bare container, inneholder i vårt tilfelle den kjørende koden for en Altinn 3 App. Men det finnes også andre containere i clusteret som inneholder systemtekniske ting som må kjøre. F. eks. så vil enhver Altinn 3 app container få følge av en Linkerd container som tar seg av kryptering/dekryptering av trafikk inn og ut av Altinn 3 applikasjonen.\nPods En pod er den minste kjørbare enheten i et kubernetes cluster og er det vi allokerer ressurser til. En pod kan bestå av en eller flere containere. En Altinn 3 applikasjon vil typisk bestå av en app container og en såkalt sidecar container som kjører Linkerd. Linkerd er den komponenten som tar seg av kryptering/dekryptering av kommunikasjon mellom pods i et cluster. Grunnen til at vi nevner denne er at denne også vil kreve minne og CPU ressurser.\nDeployments En deployment styrer levetiden til en applikasjon, hvor mange instanser den skal ha samt allokering av minne og CPU. I Altinn 3 spesifiseres dette ved hjelp av såkalte Helm charts,. Dette kan sees på som en innpakking av en applikasjon med fornuftige standard verdier, men standard konfigurasjonen kan overstyres.\nMerk: Noe av ressursene i et Kubernetes cluster vil gå med til systemtekniske prosesser både fra Kubernetes selv og fra Altinn infrastrukturen, så ikke alle ressurser i et cluster vil være tilgjengelig til fordeling til apps.\nPractical tips for resource allocation Resource AllocationWhich resources are allocated in a cluster and how?\n"

	"description": "Altinn Notifications automatically splits long SMS messages into multiple segments to ensure delivery. This article explains how SMS segmentation works, which character limits apply, and what will and will not work when using the API.",
	"content": "Introduction SMS messages have technical limitations on how many characters can be sent in a single message. When you send SMS via Altinn Notifications, the system automatically handles the splitting of long messages into multiple segments. This allows you to send longer texts without having to split them manually.\nUnderstanding how segmentation works is important to ensure that your messages are delivered as expected and to avoid messages being rejected due to length limitations.\nHow SMS segmentation works SMS technology has two different modes for message length:\nSingle message (up to 160 characters) If your message is 160 characters or shorter, it is sent as a single SMS. This is the most efficient way to send short messages.\nConcatenated messages (over 160 characters) When the message is longer than 160 characters, it is automatically split into multiple segments that are sent separately and reassembled on the recipient\u0026rsquo;s phone. Each segment in a concatenated message can contain up to 134 characters.\nThe reason segments are 134 characters instead of 160 characters is that some space is used for metadata that tells the recipient\u0026rsquo;s phone how to reassemble the segments. Character limitations Altinn Notifications has the following limitations for SMS messages:\nSingle message: up to 160 characters Concatenated message: up to 134 characters per segment Maximum number of segments: 16 segments Maximum total length: 2144 characters (16 × 134 characters) The maximum limit of 16 segments is a limitation in the SMS gateway that Altinn Notifications uses. Messages that exceed this limit are truncated to the first 16 segments. Segmentation examples Message length Number of segments Description 50 characters 1 Sent as a single SMS 160 characters 1 Sent as a single SMS (maximum length) 161 characters 2 Split into 2 segments (134 + 27 characters) 268 characters 2 Split into 2 segments (134 + 134 characters) 269 characters 3 Split into 3 segments (134 + 134 + 1 character) 2144 characters 16 Split into 16 segments (maximum length) 2145 characters 16 Truncated to 16 segments (content shortened) Special characters and URL encoding When the system calculates message length, URL-encoded length is used. This means that certain special characters count as more than one character.\nCharacters that affect length The following types of characters can affect the actual length of the message:\nÆ, Ø, Å and other national special characters Emojis and other special symbols Line breaks and other control characters Practical example Original message: \u0026#34;Meeting at 14:00\u0026#34; Character length: 16 characters URL-encoded length: 22 characters (38% longer) The example shows how spaces become \u0026ldquo;%20\u0026rdquo; (3 characters) and colons become \u0026ldquo;%3A\u0026rdquo; (3 characters) in URL encoding.\nTo be sure that your message does not exceed the limits, you should test with representative examples that contain the same types of special characters you plan to use. Limitations and what does not work What happens to messages over 2144 characters? When a message (measured in URL-encoded length) exceeds 2144 characters:\nThe message is automatically truncated to the first 16 segments (2144 characters) Content beyond this limit is not sent You receive no error message from the API indicating that the content has been truncated The API will not notify you that the message has been truncated. It is therefore essential to test message length in advance, especially if you are using many special characters. Recommendations To ensure that your messages are delivered as expected:\nKeep messages short and concise - under 160 characters if possible Avoid unnecessary emojis - these can significantly increase the length Test with representative data - use special characters similar to what you will use in production Plan for segmentation - if you know the message will be long, ensure it still makes sense even when split up Consider alternative channels - for longer messages, email may be a better choice How the API handles segmentation When you send an SMS via the Altinn Notifications API:\nYou send the entire message - you do not need to split it yourself The system calculates the length - based on URL-encoded length The system calculates the number of segments - and limits to a maximum of 16 segments The system splits the message - automatically into segments if necessary The message is sent - segments are delivered to the SMS gateway If the URL-encoded length of the message requires more than 16 segments, only the first 16 segments (2144 characters) are sent. You receive no error message about this, so it is important to validate message length in advance. You cannot control how the message is split into segments. The splitting happens automatically based on the character limits described in this article. "

The filename format for texts should be resource.[language].json e.g: resource.nb.json.\nTexts can be edited locally, directly in the JSON-files, or via the Altinn Studio text editor.\nFormatting of texts All texts can be formatted with markdown. Below you can see the most commonly used syntax.\nA more thorough explanation of the markdown syntax can be found here: Markdown Cheatsheet.\nBold and italic texts Its very easy to make words or sentences bold or italic with markdown.\nThis is in _italic_ using underscores. This is also in *italic* using asterisk. This is in __bold__ using double underscores. This is also in **bold**, using double asterisk. Line breaks With markdown this is done with \\n, which denotes a new line. To actually display the text as a new paragraph, two line breaks must be used. F.ex.;\nThis is a text.\\n\\nThis is a text on the next line. Alternatively you could use html instead:\nThis is a text.\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;This is a text on the next line.

This default error message will be displayed as \u0026ldquo;You need to upload 1 attachement(s) to continue'.\nDefault text displayed in application These default texts consist of two strings, one before the number: You need to upload and one text resource after the number: attachment(s) to continue. Currently, it is only possible to edit the text surrounding the number, not the number itself.\nDefault texts and keys Add the text key and the new value in App/configuration/texts/resource.

Data can be fetched from fields regardless if they are visible or not. If the user changes data in a field referenced in a variable, the text will be updated when the user stops typing in the field. Application Settings\nBy defining applicationSettings as the data source you can fetch values from a specific section in appsettings.{environment}.json files with the key FrontEndSettings. This is a dynamic list you can extend without making changes to the code. This makes it possible to have different values in different environments.

The properties that are currently available are: instanceOwnerPartyId contains the party ID of the instance owner. instanceId contains the ID of the active instance. appId contains the ID of the application, which the active instance belongs to. Custom text parameters\nRequires version \u0026gt;= 8.7.0 of the Altinn.App.* packages. By defining customTextParameters as the data source you can access custom values in the contexts that support it. Currently, CustomTextParameters can be used in ValidationIssue and InstantiationValidationResult. Example: new ValidationIssue() { CustomTextKey = \u0026#34;good.text.id\u0026#34;, CustomTextParameters = new() { [\u0026#34;\u0026lt;custom text parameter key\u0026gt;\u0026#34;] = someValue }, Field = \u0026#34;someField\u0026#34;, Severity = ValidationIssueSeverity.Error, }; Default value If a variable is not found in the data source, the path to that field in the data source is displayed. However, if you want to display something other than this path, you can add a defaultValue option to each variable.\nSetting the defaultValue to an empty string will ensure that no text is displayed if the field in the data source cannot be found.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;good.text.id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{0}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variables\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;someField\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.default\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;defaultValue\u0026#34;: \u0026#34; \u0026#34; } ] } Complete example: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;common.submitinfo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;You are submitting for: {0} with organisation number: {1}.

E.g:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;common.submitinfo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;You are submitting for: {0} with organisation number: {1}.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variables\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;skattepliktig[{0}].organisasjonsnavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.default\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;skattepliktig[{0}].organisasjonsnummer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.default\u0026#34; } ] } It is possible to combine variables from fields in repeating groups with variables from fields that are not in repeating groups. However, it is not recommended to combine variables from fields in different repeating groups, unless you are sure that the order of the items in the groups will be identical.\nAdding help texts Help texts are short texts that give a concrete description of what the end user is expected to fill in the field which the help text is connected to.\nThe keys that define the help texts are defined in FormLayout.json. In the repository this file is located in App/ui/.\nBelow is an example of a FormLayout.json without help texts.\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;616071dc-90b1-4ce5-8d18-492844828a41\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Header\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appName\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;08d707a9-2475-4d23-bf76-f209fb434ec2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TextArea\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tilleggsopplysninger.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tilleggsopplysninger.desc\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;omsetningsoppgaverTilleggsopplysninger.value\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bd6589b6-e2ab-49ba-b39a-dd3f8b63e5de\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Send inn\u0026#34; } } ] } } If you want to add help texts to any of these components you have to\nAdd the help text in the resource file as described here. Open the FormLayout.json-file. Add the binding to the new help text with the key \u0026quot;help\u0026quot; and value equal the newly added text resource. This is how the file looks after adding help texts:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;616071dc-90b1-4ce5-8d18-492844828a41\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Header\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appName\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;08d707a9-2475-4d23-bf76-f209fb434ec2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TextArea\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tilleggsopplysninger.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tilleggsopplysninger.desc\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;help\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tilleggsopplysninger.help\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;omsetningsoppgaverTilleggsopplysninger.value\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bd6589b6-e2ab-49ba-b39a-dd3f8b63e5de\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Send inn\u0026#34; } } ] } } Change application title When you create an application you have a text resource with the label appName. This it the title of the application that will be displayed in several places in our solution, e.g. when an end user is filling out a form or when elements are displayed in the message box in altinn.no.\nThe title of the application is located in two places in the application repository:\nIn the text resource with the key appName. In applicationmetadata.json in the title property. This file is located at App/config/. App owners are encouraged to add titles in Norwegian Bokmål, Norwegian Nynorsk and English. If a title is missing in the text resources the repository name will be used as a fallback, and may be shown to the end user.\nIf you change appName from an IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code), it is important to also update the title in applicationmetadata.json. If the title is changed from Altinn Studio on the \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo; page or \u0026ldquo;Languages\u0026rdquo; page, the applicationmetadata.json file is automatically updated.\nApplication title configuration example In App/config/applicationmetadata.json:\n\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Automatisk deploy applikasjonen\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Automatisk deploy applikasjonen\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Auto deploy application\u0026#34; }, In App/config/texts/resource.nb.json:\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Automatisk deploy applikasjonen\u0026#34; }, ... ] } In App/config/texts/resource.nn.json:\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Automatisk deploy applikasjonen\u0026#34; }, ... ] } I App/config/texts/resource.en.json:\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Auto deploy application\u0026#34; }, ... ] } Change app owner text The application name and app owner is displayed at the top in the application.\nApplication name and application owner texts The application owner is fetched by default from the texts defined in altinn-orgs.json. If you want to change this name, you can add the key appOwner in the text resources. This wil override the value coming from CDN.\nExample:\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appOwner\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Test Ministry\u0026#34; }, ... ] } Change texts on the archive receipt page The texts on the receipt page can be overridden by specifying the texts in the application\u0026rsquo;s config/texts/resource.[language].json file(s).\nOverriding any of the texts in the receipt will affect all the receipts for the given application. This means that forms that are already submitted will also get the updated texts on their receipt page. The generated PDF will not be affected by this. You can also use markdown and variables in the receipt texts. Currently, you can only fetch variables from Instance (See Data Sources for details)\nThese are the text IDs that can be used to override the default texts for archived receipt:\nreceipt_platform.attachments receipt_platform.date_sent receipt_platform.helper_text receipt_platform.is_sent receipt_platform.receipt receipt_platform.receiver receipt_platform.reference_number receipt_platform.sender receipt_platform.sent_content If you, for example, want to change the help text, you can add the following to the config/texts/resource.en.json file in your application:\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;receipt_platform.helper_text\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My custom help text\u0026#34; } ] } The image below shows which key controls which text in the UI\nTexts and text keys Note: These text changes will not be visible in your local test environment, they will only be visible in the test environment TT02. To view the changes, navigate to the \u0026ldquo;Archive\u0026rdquo; page and press the \u0026ldquo;See submitted form\u0026rdquo; button.\nThese modified texts are only applicable to the platform receipt and will not have any effect on the receipt that is presented to a user after they have completed a form. See receipt for information on how to customize both texts and the layout of this receipt.\nTranslation of textsHow to translate texts in the application.\n"

Privacy and security assessments are conducted for all new requests for needs. All bug fixes and changes are checked for security vulnerabilities both logically (function) and technically (code). Fixes and changes that may have a security risk are security tested using recommended techniques before deployment to production. We engage third-party consultants periodically for security testing of major changes and review of existing functionality.\nRisk assessments are conducted related to new functionality in the solution and when introducing new tools and systems for use in development or management of the solution. It is required that the providers for system operation and application operation of Altinn II also perform regular risk assessments, as well as in changes related to the solution. For Altinn 3, Digdir conducts risk assessments itself and uses hired security consultants as needed. Hired development and management resources also contribute.\nRegular security audits of the Altinn solution, both Altinn II and 3, are carried out. Service owners in Altinn can request to be presented with security audits showing how Altinn handles the service owner\u0026rsquo;s data, and also have the opportunity to request further security audits. Security-related information may be subject to special restrictions regarding access and dissemination, which the service owner must comply with, including that the information may be classified according to the Security Act.\n5.1.1 Risk Assessment As mentioned above, Altinn is subject to strict security requirements. Risk assessments are made and updated continuously. Risk mitigating measures are implemented to reduce risks.\nAlso, for cloud operation of Altinn, analyses of risks and vulnerabilities have been conducted, with corresponding risk mitigating measures. In the following, we will discuss risks with a focus on the end-user\u0026rsquo;s privacy.\n5.1.1.1 Integrity and Confidentiality Threats to the integrity and confidentiality of the end-user\u0026rsquo;s personal data already exist in Altinn II, which is operated and managed \u0026ldquo;on-prem\u0026rdquo; using private suppliers. With cloud operation of Altinn by an international cloud provider, we have assessed that the risk profile does not change.\nThere is a certain risk that the cloud provider or its subcontractors have unauthorized access to data in the solution, which could be exploited by a high-capacity threat agent.\nHowever, there are significant advantages for the integrity and confidentiality of using a reputable cloud service provider like Microsoft, as such a provider has significantly greater capabilities in working with information security than smaller, local, suppliers with significantly fewer resources and means.\n5.1.1.2 Availability Regarding the availability of the data, Microsoft Azure has a high service level and uptime. However, the standard terms contain provisions that the provider can shut down its services or terminate the agreement on very short notice.\nThis risk would entail that, theoretically and contractually, there is a possibility for change related to the availability of the end-user\u0026rsquo;s personal data, even if the daily service level could be better than already established national operational solutions.\nHowever, we also assess that a large international cloud service provider depends on trust and availability of its solutions and the customer\u0026rsquo;s data. And that the provider will go to great lengths to ensure very good availability.\n5.1.1.3 Right to Information and Access (Transparency) It is Digdir through ASF that will handle the registered individual\u0026rsquo;s right to information and access to data for which we are responsible for processing.\nService owners will handle the registered individual\u0026rsquo;s right to information and access to data in their services, for which the service owners are responsible for processing. The standard terms of cloud providers generally include provisions that the provider will support such requests from the customer. Therefore, we do not see that the risk of breaches of the registered individual\u0026rsquo;s right to information and access will increase with the cloud operation of Altinn.\n5.1.1.4 Correction, Modification, Limitation, and Deletion As is the case for information and access, it is still Digdir through ASF that will handle the registered individual\u0026rsquo;s rights related to this. And in most cases, Altinn will have to refer the end-user to the public entity that is the source of the basic data information that Altinn uses, or the service owner for the individual service in Altinn.\nWe cannot see a greater risk of breaches of the registered individual\u0026rsquo;s right to have their personal data corrected, modified, or processing limited.\n5.1.1.5 Linking of Datasets Regarding the improper linking of datasets, the risk for this will not increase in principle – as it is still ASF and the service owners who will control this.\n5.1.1.6 Specific Aspects of Cloud Services Entering into a contract with an international cloud service provider means a large foreign company as a contractual party. This has consequences for the agreement that is entered into, which largely consists of standard terms.\nThis is relevant because the law and principles of interpretation of another country often must be applied in the contractual relationship. Digdir\u0026rsquo;s agreement with Microsoft is subject to Irish law. This introduces interpretation risk, process risk, and practical limitations in our ability and willingness to legally pursue breaches of the agreement.\n5.1.2 Risk Mitigating Measures Digdir has introduced increased and partially new risk mitigating measures. The introduction of such measures, and the continuous monitoring and control of them, will be subject to the agency\u0026rsquo;s routines and processes, including our internal control regime.\nThe risks and the risk mitigating measures are more thoroughly described in separate risk assessments and security documentation for Altinn 3, with possible action points.\n5.2 Benefits for the Registered Individual\u0026rsquo;s Privacy Cloud operation of Altinn will also entail positive consequences for the registered individual\u0026rsquo;s privacy. More efficient digital solutions enable the improvement of data minimization, as well as even easier access to updated and correct information from data sources. Solutions for access control, authorization, and consent for data sharing can also be improved and achieve greater reuse in the public sector, including in interaction with the private sector.\nThe use of powerful processing capabilities and scalability in the cloud, coupled with lower costs associated with utilizing such flexibility, also enables privacy-friendly measures in the digital service being established.\nIt will also become much faster, easier, and less costly to configure environments up and down as needed, ensuring that at all times, only the necessary number of technical environments containing data are maintained.\nIt is also the case that Microsoft, like the other major cloud service providers, uses technology and standard software that is generally easier to update with patches for vulnerabilities than a more proprietary developed solution.\nMicrosoft also lives off selling trust services and is therefore highly concerned with the security of its solutions and the customers\u0026rsquo; data – even though they take legal reservations to operate globally with an acceptable legal risk. They will generally have greater expertise and capacity to further refine their solutions and services to meet a threat landscape that is constantly changing, compared to, for example, local operational providers that exclusively operate in Norway.\nMicrosoft Azure is also certified according to a very large number of national and international standards, including in accordance with the adequacy decision, and is regularly audited by third parties – where reports are also made available for the customers.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "What can be stored in the data model",
	"content": "Storing the chosen option Below are some examples of setting up data binding for components using options. For some components, the setup will be different, and it is recommended to look at the specific documentation for the component for more information. Components using options must be set up to store the selected options in the data model. Usually, the component will store the value of the selected option in the data model against a field of type string, set up in the component configuration with the key simpleBinding:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;single-choice-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;RadioButtons\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Do you own a cat?\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Submitter.HasCat\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;y\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Yes\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;n\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;No\u0026#34; } ] } In the example above, the component will store the choice of whether the user owns a cat in the field Submitter.HasCat in the data model. This field will get the value y if the user chooses \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; and n if the user chooses \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo;.\nFor multi-choice components such as Checkboxes and MultipleSelect, the component will store a comma-separated list of selected values in the data model.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;multi-choice-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Checkboxes\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Which pets do you have?\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Submitter.Pets\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Cat\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dog\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dog\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;fish\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Fish\u0026#34; } ] } In the example above, the component will store a comma-separated list of selected pets in the field Submitter.Pets in the data model. If you choose \u0026ldquo;Cat\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Fish\u0026rdquo;, the field will get the value \u0026quot;cat,fish\u0026quot;. The order of the choices is not guaranteed to be the same as the order of the options, nor the order the user chose them in.\nNote that the value for each option must be unique, and if you use multi-choice components, none of the values can contain a comma. Storing the label Components using options will usually only store the value of the selected option in the data model. While this is usually sufficient, there are cases where you might want to store the label of the selected option as well. This can be useful for displaying the selected option in a simple presentation of the data without additional lookups or if you have a requirement to remember the label the user actually picked in case it has changed over time. When storing the label in the data model, it will respect the user\u0026rsquo;s chosen language, look up the actual text from the text resources and store the final value in the data model.\nThis is configured by having a separate binding with the key label. The label binding should point to a field in the data model of type string:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;municipality.value\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;municipality.label\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;municipalities\u0026#34; } Storing metadata When fetching options, especially shared common code lists, you might want to store some metadata describing how the options were fetched. This can be useful for reconstructing the options after the form has been submitted, as well as for logging purposes.\nThis can be configured by setting the metadata property on the components dataModelBinding property to a field in the data model containing a string value:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-dropdown-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;soknad.nyGaranti.loyvetype\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;soknad.nyGaranti.loyvetypeMetadata\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;loyvetyper\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mapping\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;soknad.transportorOrgnummer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;orgnummer\u0026#34; } } This configuration will store the metadata of the retrieved options as a comma separated string in the field soknad.nyGaranti.loyvetypeMetadata in the data model.\n"

The instance document is a way for Altinn and external parties to track the state of one specific data exchange. How long an instance lives and how many interactions there are between the application owner and user will vary from one app to another. Advanced apps will have their own documentation.\nbasePath\n{org}/{appname}/instances Get instance Endpoint for downloading the instance metadata document for a specific instance. The app API does not have an endpoint for listing instances. The Storage API in the Platform has a query endpoint that can be used for this purpose.\nUse this endpoint for instances that are active, and the owner party id and instance guid for the instance are known. External systems that work with an instance over multiple sessions might want to keep these values (or full URL) stored on their end to limit the need to query this information multiple times.\nGET {basePath}/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid} Get active instances Endpoint for listing active instances for an instance owner.\nThis endpoint can be used to determine if a new instance of an app should be created or if continuation on an existing instance would be more feasible. Note that the object returned is a simplified instance object and that LastChangedBy contains the name of the latest active entity rather than an id number.\n[ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337/bffd2c17-9d93-49f4-b504-3d0ece2402c7\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChanged\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-09-23T10:19:43\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChangedBy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Sophie Salt\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;instanceId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337/agfd2c17-4d93-49f4-b504-3d0ece2402d8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChanged\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-07-11T22:14:02\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChangedBy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Sophie Salt\u0026#34; } ] GET {basePath}/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/active Create instance Altinn assigns a unique identifier to all users that wish to report data. We call this id instanceOwner.partyId. If you do not know this, you should provide the official identity number, e.g national identification number for persons or organisation number for organisations, and in some case user name. This should be provided as part of the payload to the creation request. Altinn will look up this identifier and replace it with the instanceOwner.partyId. The official identity number will be stored in the instance metadata.\nData elements can be provided as part of the creation request, but can also be uploaded at a later time.\nThe client specifies the instance owner and may set a number of the metadata fields of the instance by attaching the following form:\n{ \u0026#34;appId\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;org/app\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instanceOwner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;personNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12247918309\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organisationNumber\u0026#34;: null }, \u0026#34;dueBefore\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2019-06-01T12:00:00Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;visibleAfter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2019-05-20T00:00:00Z\u0026#34; } Notice that all dates must be expressed in Utc (Zulu) time zone and represented according to ISO 8601!\nData elements (files) can be attached to the initial request as a multipart/form-data or as attachments. The name of the parts must correspond to element types defined in the application metadata.\nPOST {basePath} Instantiate for instance owner A multipart/formdata should contain the instance json document and the data element files of the instance. The first part should be instance which contains the json template to create an instance from.\nThe subsequent parts must have a name that correspond to the element types defined in application metadata. They may have a filename. Hence the model1 and certificate names correspond to data types defined in the application metadata. If additional data elements are required they must be defined in the application metadata.\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=\u0026#34;abcdefg\u0026#34; --abcdefg Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026#34;instance\u0026#34; { ... } --abcdefg Content-Type: application/xml Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026#34;model1\u0026#34; \u0026lt;xml\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/xml\u0026gt; --abcdefg Content-Type: application/pdf Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026#34;certificate\u0026#34;; filename=certificate.pdf %PDF-1.4 %Óëéá 1 0 obj ... --abcdefg-- This call will return the instance metadata document that was created.\nSimplified instantiation For scenarios where the multipart is not required there is a new API that is simpler.

Technically this only means that the instance is no longer needed by the application owner.\nAltinn will permanently delete an instance and all the data, if both application owner and a user with the necessary rights indicate on the instance that they no longer have a need for it.\nPOST {basePath}/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid}/complete The request does not use the request body for anything even though it is a POST request.\nDelete instance Endpoint for marking an instance as deleted. This can be used by both application owner and user to delete an instance. The endpoint has an optional parameter called hard that can be used to indicate the type of delete that is wanted. Setting the parameter to false or simply omitting it, will move the instance to a recycle bin. Hard delete means that the instance will be unrecoverable.\nInstances that where active might be permanently deleted by Altinn within a few days. Archived instances will be permanently deleted if both application owner and a user with the necessary rights indicate on the instance that they no longer have a need for it.\nDELETE {basePath}/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid}?hard=true The endpoint does not use the request body for anything.\nThere are no Application API endpoint for recovering instances in the recycle bin.\n"

Instant notifications are a variant of the notification service in Altinn Notifications that send messages immediately to a single recipient (email address or phone number).\nThis feature is useful when the user is waiting for information to proceed, such as a one-time password (OTP) during login.\nWhen should you not use instant notifications? In most cases, regular notifications are sufficient. You can omit requestedSendTime to send the notification as soon as possible, and use sendingTimePolicy: \u0026quot;Anytime\u0026quot; to allow sending around the clock. This combination typically delivers an SMS to the user within a couple of minutes. Technical characteristics Immediate sending with asynchronous status tracking The service is semi-synchronous: the order and sending occur synchronously until handover to the email or SMS provider, while delivery reports arrive asynchronously as for regular orders.\nInstant notifications work as follows:\nThe API call registers the order and sends it immediately to the SMS or email service The notification is sent to the message gateway immediately and bypasses the queue The API returns 201 Created or 200 OK with tracking information (shipmentId and notificationOrderId) Delivery status must be retrieved asynchronously via the status feed (/future/shipment/feed) or by polling /future/shipment/:id Note: The 201 Created response code only confirms that the system registered and accepted the order, not that delivery succeeded. Email can fail for various reasons, and mobile phones may be out of coverage. Idempotency Instant notifications support idempotency through a mandatory idempotencyId field:\nPrevents the same message from being sent multiple times upon repeated requests Useful during network problems or timeouts The same idempotencyId returns the same result (shipmentId etc.) without resending the message The API does not check whether the content differs from previous calls with the same ID The API returns 201 Created on the first successful call, or 200 OK if the call with the same idempotencyId has already succeeded Time-to-live For SMS-based instant notifications, you must specify a timeToLiveInSeconds field:\nSpecifies how long the SMS gateway should attempt to deliver the message Important for one-time passwords that expire after a certain time. A code that arrives after expiration is useless. Capacity Instant notifications are not for high-volume workflows:\nIntended for individual, time-critical messages, not mass mailings Intended for single-recipient notifications that require immediate sending Use regular notification orders for high volumes or bulk notifications Next steps Read the instant notifications guide to learn how to implement instant notifications in your service Explore the OpenAPI specification for technical specification details "

This guide explains how the default behaviour can be adjusted and how you can take full control over the integration if needed.\nAutomatic dialog synchronization By default, the synchronization is enabled for all applications.

	"description": "How to migrate from App-frontend v3 to v4",
	"content": "Introduction This guide will help you migrate your app from using version 3 of App-frontend to version 4. Since there are several breaking changes between these versions, it is very important that you test your app thoroughly after migrating. There is currently no support in Altinn Studio for upgrading apps, so using the Altinn Studio CLI is the recommended way to migrate. This will fix most of the breaking changes automatically, but you may still need to make some manual changes to your code.\nMigrate automatically using the Altinn Studio CLI Note: You also need to upgrade the nuget packages to version 8.0. This can also be done using the Altinn Studio CLI. See Migration from v7 for more information. The Altinn Studio CLI is a command line tool for upgrading Altinn Apps. The tool is able to upgrade and fix most breaking changes between version 3 and 4 of the Altinn App-frontend.\nVerify that you have the latest version of the Altinn Studio CLI If you do not have the CLI installed, you can install it by following the instructions in the installation guide.\nMake sure you are using at least version 1.4.0 of the Altinn Studio CLI. You can check the version by running:\naltinn-studio --version If you have an older version, you can update it by running:\ndotnet tool update -g altinn.studio.cli Run the upgrade command First, navigate to the root folder of your app in your terminal. There are several optional arguments you can use with the upgrade frontend command. You can see all the available options by running:\naltinn-studio upgrade frontend --help The default options should work for most apps, but you may need to specify some options if you have a non-standard project structure. If some of the options are not correct, the CLI should print an error message explaining what went wrong.\nIt is recommended to have a clean working tree before running the upgrade command. This means that you should commit or stash any changes you have made to your code before running the command. That way you can easily see what changes the CLI made to your code, as well as reset and try again if something went wrong.\nWhen you are ready to upgrade, run the following command:\naltinn-studio upgrade frontend The CLI will then make the necessary changes to your code to upgrade it to version 4 of App-frontend. The CLI will also print warnings and errors if it encounters any problems during the upgrade process, make sure to read these carefully.\nMigrate manually To use App-frontend v4 in your app, you need to change which version is referenced in your app\u0026rsquo;s Index.cshtml file. This file should be located in the App/views/Home folder. In addition to changing the version, you should also remove the links to the third party CSS and font, as the font is now loaded by App-frontend itself, and the third party CSS is no longer used.\nChanges inside \u0026lt;head\u0026gt;: App/views/Home/Index.cshtml \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;@ViewBag.Org- @ViewBag.App\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;icon\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/favicon.ico\u0026#34;\u0026gt; - - \u0026lt;!-- Third Party CSS --\u0026gt; - \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/fortawesome/altinn-no-bold/0.1/css/embedded-woff.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt; - \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/fortawesome/altinn-no-regular/0.1/css/embedded-woff.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt; - \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/fortawesome/altinn-studio/0.1/css/embedded-woff.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt; - - \u0026lt;!-- Fonts --\u0026gt; - \u0026lt;link href=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/fonts/altinn-din/altinn-din.css\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- Runtime CSS --\u0026gt; - \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;text/css\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/3/altinn-app-frontend.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt; + \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;text/css\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/altinn-app-frontend.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Changes inside \u0026lt;body\u0026gt;: App/views/Home/Index.cshtml \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;flex-column d-flex media-body\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; function loadScript() { var appId = window.location.pathname.split(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39;); window.reportee = document.cookie.replace(/(?:(?:^|.*;\\s*)AltinnPartyId\\s*\\=\\s*([^;]*).*$)|^.*$/, \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34;);; window.org = appId[1]; window.app = appId[2]; } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;root\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;media-body flex-column d-flex\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; loadScript(); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; - \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/3/altinn-app-frontend.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; + \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/altinn-app-frontend.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; It\u0026rsquo;s optionally also possible to change the $schema reference in layout files to get the latest suggestions and validations for layout configuration.

Opt-in to Altinn AI for tracks migration In v3, IPageOrder and calculatePageOrder, so called tracks, could be used to define custom page order based on input from the user. This functionality has been removed in v4, and the page order is now determined by the layout configuration with the hidden property. To get pages to show/hide based on selections in the UI, you can use hidden together with dynamic expressions. This is a somewhat different approach to a dynamic page order, and you may find it beneficial to get some help with the migration.\nYou can opt-in for an automatic AI-generated Pull Request to help you migrate from the old tracks feature, as the new way of handling page order is also available in v3. When you have opted-in for the AI-generated Pull Request, our Altinn AI Bot will create a Pull Request in your repository with a suggested migration from tracks to dynamic expressions. This PR will be generated in a nightly run.\nSteps to opt-in on a single repository:\nIn Gitea, go to the repository where you want to opt-in for the AI-generated Pull Request. Go to the Settings tab. Go to the Collaboration section. Add \u0026ldquo;altinn_sa_ai (Altinn AI [Bot])\u0026rdquo;. Sit back and relax, and let the Altinn AI do the work for you. The PR will be created in a nightly run if the bot finds any tracks in your repository. If you want to opt-in for all repositories in your organization, you can do this on a service owner level. Steps to opt-in on a service owner level:\nIn Gitea, go to your organization: https://altinn.studio/repos/\u0026lt;orgname\u0026gt; Go to the Teams tab. Click the \u0026ldquo;Devs\u0026rdquo; team. Add \u0026ldquo;altinn_sa_ai (Altinn AI [Bot])\u0026rdquo; to the team. Sit back and relax, and let the Altinn AI do the work for you. A PR will be created in a nightly run in any repository the bot finds the tracks implementation. Note: Because the dynamic expression way of handling page order differs slightly from the tracks implementation, the migrated result might not be a 100% match to the original behavior. The AI is not perfect at migrating the code, and you should always review and test the changes made in the Pull Request before merging it. The generative AI model used for this bot is \u0026lsquo;gpt-4-1106-preview\u0026rsquo; from OpenAI, hosted as a dedicated instance on Digdir\u0026rsquo;s internal Azure subscription. Information provided to the model is limited to a relevant subset of your repository, in this case the C# classes that implement the IPageOrder interface. Note that this information is not made available to any third party for training purposes.\n"

	"description": "How to migrate from v7 to v8",
	"content": "As of writing this documentation, the latest preview release of v8 is 8.0.0. Updated information is available on GitHub. Introduction This guide will help you migrate your app from using version 7 of the app nugets to version 8. There is currently no support in Altinn Studio for upgrading apps, so using the Altinn Studio CLI is the recommended way to migrate.\nMigrate automatically using the Altinn Studio CLI The Altinn Studio CLI is a command line tool for upgrading Altinn Apps. The tool is able to upgrade and fix most breaking changes between version 7 and 8 of the app nugets.\nVerify that you have the latest version of the Altinn Studio CLI If you do not have the CLI installed, you can install it by following the instructions in the installation guide.\nMake sure you are using at least version 1.4.0 of the Altinn Studio CLI. You can check the version by running:\naltinn-studio --version If you have an older version, you can update it by running:\ndotnet tool update -g altinn.studio.cli Run the upgrade command First, navigate to the root folder of your app in your terminal. There are several optional arguments you can use with the upgrade backend command. You can see all the available options by running:\naltinn-studio upgrade backend --help The default options should work for most apps, but you may need to specify some options if you have a non-standard project structure. If some of the options are not correct, the CLI should print an error message explaining what went wrong.\nIt is recommended to have a clean working tree before running the upgrade command. This means that you should commit or stash any changes you have made to your code before running the command. That way you can easily see what changes the CLI made to your code, as well as reset and try again if something went wrong.\nBefore running the upgrade you need to first restore any dependencies: dotnet restore When you are ready to upgrade, run the following command: altinn-studio upgrade backend The CLI will then make the necessary changes to your code to upgrade it to version 8. The CLI will also print warnings and errors if it encounters any problems during the upgrade process, make sure to read these carefully.\nMigrate manually To migrate manually from v7 to v8, you need to upgrade the nuget packages in your App.csproj file to version 8.0.0. App/App.csproj - \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Api\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;7.15.3\u0026#34;\u0026gt; + \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Api\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;8.0.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;CopyToOutputDirectory\u0026gt;lib\\$(TargetFramework)\\*.xml\u0026lt;/CopyToOutputDirectory\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/PackageReference\u0026gt; - \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Core\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;7.15.3\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; + \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Core\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;8.0.0\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;CopyToOutputDirectory\u0026gt;lib\\$(TargetFramework)\\*.xml\u0026lt;/CopyToOutputDirectory\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/PackageReference\u0026gt; Next, you need to fix the breaking changes in your code. See the changelog for v8 for more information. There may be additional breaking changes not documented in the changelog that are automatically fixed by the Altinn Studio CLI tool, so it is recommended to use the CLI tool to upgrade your app to v8 instead of doing it manually.

	"tags": ["apps", "training", "form", "deploy", "test"],
	"description": "Publish the service to a test environment",
	"content": "In this module, we will publish the service to a test environment to test the service end-to-end as an end user would experience it.\nNote! The test environment (and potentially the production environment) is only available for organizations. It will not be possible to publish a service created on behalf of your own user. If you have created the service with your own user, you can proceed to the next module. Topics covered in this module Navigate to the publishing page Access to publish Build a version Publish the desired version to a test environment Requirements from Sogndal Municipality The service must be available in the test environment so that the service can be tested end-to-end.\nNavigate to the Publishing Page Navigate to the service\u0026rsquo;s publishing page by clicking the \u0026ldquo;Publish\u0026rdquo; button in the top right corner. The page will display with 3 columns: On the left: The different environments available. These are: Production if the organization has a production environment, and TT02 which is the organization\u0026rsquo;s test environment. Some organizations have multiple test environments. In the middle: An overview of which versions have been published to each environment. For a brand new service, no history will be shown here until the service is actually published. On the right: A column to build a new version of the service and an overview of previous versions. Access to Publish Access to publish a service is set up by the person who manages permissions for your organization. If you do not have access to publish for your organization, you will receive a message on the page that says:\nYou do not belong to any team in your organization.\nContact the person who manages permissions for your organization to gain access to publish to the test environment.\nBuild a Version Make sure you have uploaded all changes you have made to the service to the service\u0026rsquo;s central repository by clicking \u0026ldquo;Share changes\u0026rdquo; in the top menu, and entering a short description. Then click \u0026ldquo;Validate changes\u0026rdquo; to validate and upload all changes. Enter the version name in the \u0026ldquo;version number\u0026rdquo; field, e.g., v1. Enter a short description in the \u0026ldquo;Describe the content of the version\u0026rdquo; field, e.g., First version of the form. Click \u0026ldquo;Build version\u0026rdquo;. You will see the version appear under \u0026ldquo;Previous builds of the application\u0026rdquo; with a spinner indicating that the build is in progress. The version is complete when the spinner disappears and a green checkmark icon appears next to \u0026ldquo;Build log\u0026rdquo;. This can take 1-2 minutes.\nPublish Version to Test Environment In the middle column on the page, in the row for the TT02 environment, click the dropdown list \u0026ldquo;Select version to publish\u0026rdquo;. You will see that the version built in the previous step is now listed. Click on it to select it. Click \u0026ldquo;Publish new version\u0026rdquo; and click \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; in the dialog to confirm the publication. A new row will now appear in the overview of \u0026ldquo;Versions published to the TT02 test environment\u0026rdquo;. This row is marked in blue, with a spinner in the left column and the status \u0026ldquo;Publishing in progress\u0026rdquo;. Wait until the spinner disappears and the row is marked with a green checkmark icon. This can take about 1 minute. When the service is published to the environment, both the row in the table \u0026ldquo;Versions published to the TT02 test environment\u0026rdquo; and the environment status on the left side of the page will be marked in green. In the environment status in the left column on the page, you will get a link to the service in the test environment when the publication is complete. Click this link. Log in to the test environment using Tenor test data (Test user, select \u0026ldquo;Get random user\u0026rdquo;). You can now test the service in the TT02 test environment. Try filling out the service with some data and submit it to see what happens! Useful Documentation User Guide - Create a Simple Form Summary In this module, we built a package of the first version of the service. We then published the package to the test environment and started the service in the test environment to test it.\n\u0026laquo; Previous module "

	"description": "Follow these steps to implement Payment in your App",
	"content": "1. Before you begin Create Nets Easy agreement here: payments.nets.eu.\n2. Add a payment task to the app process, with basic configuration Altinn Studio Designer The setup in this section is done from the Process page in the app editor. Navigate there by clicking on \u0026ldquo;Process\u0026rdquo; in the top menu while in the app editor.\nAdd a payment task to the process by dragging a payment task from the left menu in the process editor, and dropping it in the process. The following configurations are automatically set up when you do this: 2 new data types related to payment are added (one for data about the payment, one for the payment receipt). A new layout set used in the payment task is added, with a page configured to show payment information in the payment task. A new rule for access management is added to the apps policy - this rule needs to be configured later. Add a Gateway after the payment task The gateway should have two outgoing sequence flows: One pointing forwards in the process One pointing backwards to the task before payment Add rules to determine when the two sequence flows should be used. Select the sequence flow going forward in the process In the panel on the right hand side, click \u0026ldquo;Add new logic rule\u0026rdquo;. This automatically sets up a new rule with the action \u0026ldquo;Reject\u0026rdquo; (reject) as a starting point. Click \u0026ldquo;Change\u0026rdquo; and change the action from \u0026ldquo;Reject\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Confirm\u0026rdquo;. Click \u0026ldquo;Save and close\u0026rdquo; to save the rule. Select the sequence flow going back in the process. Repeat the steps above, but leave the rule as-is this time - the action should be \u0026ldquo;Reject\u0026rdquo;. Eksempel på en prosess med utfylling etterfulgt av betaling Manual setup This is a description of how to set up a payment task in the app process. This involves several manual steps in multiple configuration files. If you use Altinn Studio Designer to add the payment task to the process, all the manual configuration outlined below will be set up automatically.\nCreate two data types to store payment information: This data type is used to store information and status about the payment. Put it in the dataTypes array in App/config/applicationmetadata.json.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;paymentInformation\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;allowedContributors\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;app:owned\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 0, } This data type is used to store the PDF-receipt for the payment. Configure it next to the other data type.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;paymentReceiptPdf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/pdf\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;allowedContributors\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;app:owned\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 0, } It is important to set allowedContributors to \u0026quot;app:owned\u0026quot;. This ensures that these data items cannot be edited via the app’s API but only by the app itself. Before version 8.6, this was misspelled allowedContributers.\nThe IDs can be set to something else, but they must match the IDs entered in paymentDataType and paymentReceiptPdfDataType in the process step, as shown in step 2.\nExtend the app process with payment task: A process step and a gateway must be added to App/config/process/process.bpmn, as in the example below.\nPayment uses three user actions. If the Altinn user interface is used by the app, these will be called automatically when you are in the payment step. If only the API is used, these must be called manually via the /actions endpoint.\npay: Initiates the payment, often by making API calls to the payment processor. Information and status about the initiated payment is stored in a JSON data type specified in the payment process step. confirm: Called when payment has been completed to drive the process to the next step. reject: If the end user sees something wrong with the order, the person concerned can press \u0026ldquo;Back\u0026rdquo; in the payment step. The payment is then canceled and information about the interrupted payment is deleted. Which process step you are then directed to is specified in a gateway, as exemplified below. \u0026lt;bpmn:startEvent id=\u0026#34;StartEvent_1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;Flow_start_t1\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:startEvent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:sequenceFlow id=\u0026#34;Flow_start_t1\u0026#34; sourceRef=\u0026#34;StartEvent_1\u0026#34; targetRef=\u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:task id=\u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;Utfylling\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_start_t1\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_g1_t1\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;Flow_t1_t2\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskType\u0026gt;data\u0026lt;/altinn:taskType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:task\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:sequenceFlow id=\u0026#34;Flow_t1_t2\u0026#34; sourceRef=\u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34; targetRef=\u0026#34;Task_2\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:task id=\u0026#34;Task_2\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;Betaling\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_t1_t2\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;Flow_t2_g1\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskType\u0026gt;payment\u0026lt;/altinn:taskType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action\u0026gt;confirm\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action\u0026gt;pay\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action\u0026gt;reject\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:paymentConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:paymentDataType\u0026gt;paymentInformation\u0026lt;/altinn:paymentDataType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:paymentReceiptPdfDataType\u0026gt;paymentReceiptPdf\u0026lt;/altinn:paymentReceiptPdfDataType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:paymentConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:task\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:sequenceFlow id=\u0026#34;Flow_t2_g1\u0026#34; sourceRef=\u0026#34;Task_2\u0026#34; targetRef=\u0026#34;Gateway_1\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:exclusiveGateway id=\u0026#34;Gateway_1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_t2_g1\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;Flow_g1_t1\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;Flow_g1_end\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:exclusiveGateway\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:sequenceFlow id=\u0026#34;Flow_g1_t1\u0026#34; sourceRef=\u0026#34;Gateway_1\u0026#34; targetRef=\u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:conditionExpression\u0026gt;[\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;gatewayAction\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;reject\u0026#34;]\u0026lt;/bpmn:conditionExpression\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:sequenceFlow\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:sequenceFlow id=\u0026#34;Flow_g1_end\u0026#34; sourceRef=\u0026#34;Gateway_1\u0026#34; targetRef=\u0026#34;EndEvent_1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:conditionExpression\u0026gt;[\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;gatewayAction\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;confirm\u0026#34;]\u0026lt;/bpmn:conditionExpression\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:sequenceFlow\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:endEvent id=\u0026#34;EndEvent_1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_g1_end\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:endEvent\u0026gt; The value of the node \u0026lt;altinn:paymentDataType\u0026gt;paymentInformation\u0026lt;/altinn:paymentDataType\u0026gt; must match the ID of the data type you configured in the previous step. Same for the pdf-receipt data type.\nAdd Payment layoutSet Add a new layoutSet folder for your payment task, and update your layout-sets.json.\nYour layout-sets.json may look something like this:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout-sets.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sets\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;form\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34; ] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;payment\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Task_2\u0026#34; ] } ] } In your payment layoutSet folder, add a new file, payment.json, with the following layout:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;payment-test-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Payment\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Oppsummering\u0026#34; } } ] } } This is required for payment to work, without it, your payment step will just render a white page.\n3. Ensure correct authorization for payment task Altinn Studio Designer The setup in this section is done from the Process page in the app editor. Navigate there by clicking on \u0026ldquo;Process\u0026rdquo; in the top menu while in the app editor.\nClick on the payment task in the process editor to see the details about the task in the config panel on the right-hand side of the page. Select the \u0026ldquo;Access rules\u0026rdquo; section to expand it, and click on \u0026ldquo;Go to access rules\u0026rdquo;. Scroll down to the bottom of the modal, and see that there is a rule marked in red. This rule is missing which roles apply. Add the role(s) that should have access to the payment task. Notice that once the roles are added, the rule is valid and no longer marked in red. Close the Settings modal by clicking the X at the top right. Manual setup The user making the payment needs to have authorization for the read, write, pay, confirm and reject actions on the payment task. 4. Configure display of payment information in form Altinn Studio Designer The setup in this section is done from the Lage page in the app editor. Navigate there by clicking on \u0026ldquo;Lage\u0026rdquo; in the top menu while in the app editor.\nHow to show payment information in the form This step should be done in the layout set connected to the data task (the form). You can switch between layout sets in the dropdown at the top left of the Lage-page. The default data task that is shipped with the app when it is created is connected to a default layout set called \u0026ldquo;form\u0026rdquo;. If you have added other data tasks to the process, the layout set name matches the ID of the process task.\nDrag the component \u0026ldquo;Payment details\u0026rdquo; into the form. This component shows a table that displays the elements the user must pay for.\nThe component is located at the bottom of the \u0026ldquo;Advanced\u0026rdquo; section in the component column on the left-hand side of the page. You can place this component anywhere you like in your form. We recommend that you place it on the last page the user is shown before moving on to the payment task.\nTo update the order details when the user enters data in the form, you need to map which data fields are used to calculate the order. This is a manual process for now, and is done directly in the layout-files. See example below.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;paymentDetails\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;PaymentDetails\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Oversikt over betaling\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Her er en oversikt over hva du skal betale for.\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;mapping\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;GoodsAndServicesProperties.Inventory.InventoryProperties\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;paymentDetails\u0026#34; } } How to show payment information in the payment task This was configured automatically if you used Altinn Studio Designer and the process editor to set up the payment task. See the tab \u0026ldquo;Manual setup\u0026rdquo; for details on how to do this manually.\nHow to set up a separate layout for payment receipt (optional) This step is optional. The default is to use the same setup as the layout from the payment step.\nEnsure that you are working on the views for the payment step. Click \u0026ldquo;Add new page\u0026rdquo;. In the configuration panel for the page, open \u0026ldquo;PDF\u0026rdquo; and click on \u0026ldquo;Convert page to PDF\u0026rdquo;. Add the \u0026ldquo;Payment\u0026rdquo; component, and any other of the available components to the PDF layout. To preview the final PDF, click the developer tool button at the botton right-hand side of the preview column Click the \u0026ldquo;Preview PDF\u0026rdquo; button. Manual setup Add OrderDetails component to your form This will display a table showing the items the user will need to pay for. You can put this anywhere in your app, but we recommend at the very least putting it on the last page before the user is prompted to pay.\nIn order to update the order lines as the data used to calculate the order lines changes, you need to add a mapping to the data fields used to calculate the order lines.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;paymentDetails\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;PaymentDetails\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Oversikt over betaling\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Her er en oversikt over hva du skal betale for.\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;mapping\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;GoodsAndServicesProperties.Inventory.InventoryProperties\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;paymentDetails\u0026#34; } } Add a layout for the receipt (Optional) If you would like to display additional information by adding components the receipt presented to the customer, you need to add a custom layout for it.\nAdd a custom layout file, f ex receiptLayout.json.\nHere is a minimal example:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Payment\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;renderAsSummary\u0026#34;: true } ] } } Update your layout set Settings.json file, specifying your receipt layout in the pdfLayoutName field:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;payment\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;pdfLayoutName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;paymentReceipt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;showProgress\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;showLanguageSelector\u0026#34;: true } } This is all you need to render a valid receipt, however, you can also customize it by adding additional components to receiptLayout.json, for example a Paragraph component if you want to add additional information.\n5. Calculate amount to pay Altinn Studio Designer This step needs to be done in the app code. Take a look at the \u0026ldquo;Manual setup\u0026rdquo; tab for this section for guidance.\nManual setup Implement the IOrderDetailsCalculator interface: Add a new class where you have your custom code, for example: App/logic/OrderDetailsCalculator.cs.\nHere you will implement your logic to calculate what the user will pay for. For example, you can add order lines based on form data, add mandatory fees, or add a fixed cost for the form.\nThe return value from the CalculateOrderDetails method indicates:\nPayment processor to be used for the order. These are made available by implementing the IPaymentProcessor interface and registering them as transient in program.cs. Fill in Nets Easy to use the default implementation for Nets Easy. Currency Order lines Details of payment receiver. Used in receipt. Details about the payer (optional), If you want to pre-fill this information with Nets Easy. Can be used in combination with Nets Easy\u0026rsquo;s flag MerchantHandlesConsumerData, which we have exposed via appsettings.json NetsPaymentSettings.MerchantHandlesConsumerData. If it is set to true, payer details must be sent along, otherwise, it will fail. In this example, the order lines are calculated based on form data:\npublic class OrderDetailsCalculator : IOrderDetailsCalculator { private readonly IDataClient _dataClient; public OrderDetailsCalculator(IDataClient dataClient) { _dataClient = dataClient; } public async Task\u0026lt;OrderDetails\u0026gt; CalculateOrderDetails(Instance instance, string? language) { DataElement modelData = instance.Data.Single(x =\u0026gt; x.DataType == \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;); InstanceIdentifier instanceIdentifier = new(instance); Form formData = (Form) await _dataClient.GetFormData(instanceIdentifier.InstanceGuid, typeof(Form), instance.Org, instance.AppId, instanceIdentifier.InstanceOwnerPartyId, new Guid(modelData.Id)); List\u0026lt;PaymentOrderLine\u0026gt; paymentOrderLines = formData.GoodsAndServicesProperties.Inventory.InventoryProperties .Where(x =\u0026gt; !string.IsNullOrEmpty(x.NiceClassification) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !string.IsNullOrEmpty(x.GoodsAndServices)) .Select((x, index) =\u0026gt; new PaymentOrderLine { Id = index.ToString(), Name = $\u0026#34;{GetLocalizedName(x.Id, language)}\u0026#34;, PriceExVat = GetPriceForInventoryItem(x), Quantity = 1, VatPercent = 0M }) .ToList(); return new OrderDetails { PaymentProcessorId = \u0026#34;Nets Easy\u0026#34;, Currency = \u0026#34;NOK\u0026#34;, OrderLines = paymentOrderLines, Receiver = GetReceiverDetails()}; } } Register IOrderDetailsCalculator implementation in program.cs:\nvoid RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // Register your apps custom service implementations here. services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IOrderDetailsCalculator, OrderDetailsCalculator\u0026gt;(); } 6. Connect the app to the NETS Easy agreement Altinn Studio Designer This step needs to be done manually. Support for configuration in Altinn Studio Designer will come during autumn 2024. Take a look at the \u0026ldquo;Manual setup\u0026rdquo;-tab for this section for guidance.\nManual setup Add config to appsettings.json: Get your secret key from Nets.. Make sure you use the test key during development.\nMake your app ready for use of Azure Key Vault as a config provider, if this has not been done before. See relevant documentation.\nAdd your secret key to Key Vault, with the variable name NetsPaymentSettings--SecretApiKey. This way it will override SecretApiKey in appsettings.json.\nAdd NetsPaymentSettings to your appsettings.json.\n{ \u0026#34;NetsPaymentSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;SecretApiKey\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;In keyvault\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;BaseUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://test.api.dibspayment.eu/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;TermsUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://www.yourwebsite.com/terms\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ShowOrderSummary\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;ShowMerchantName\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;MerchantHandlesConsumerData\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;PaymentMethodsConfiguration\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Visa\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Enabled\u0026#34;: true }, { \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MasterCard\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Enabled\u0026#34;: true } ] } } Remember to set the correct baseUrl in production using appsettings.Production.json. The example above contains the test api URL. The field MerchantHandlesConsumerData is optional, and controls whether you are going to supply details about the payer, or if that should be filled out in the Nets Easy payment page. PaymentMethodsConfiguration works just like explained in the Nets documentation here. Local mocking of SecretApiKey can be done with the use of user secrets.\ndotnet user-secrets init dotnet user-secrets set \u0026#34;NetsPaymentSettings:SecretApiKey\u0026#34; \u0026#34;test-secret-key-used-for-documentation\u0026#34; "

	"description": "How to configure the generation of PDF",
	"content": "New PDF generation Enable feature As of version 7.5 of the nuget packages (Altinn.App.Api and Altinn.App.Core) a new way of generating PDFs launched as a preview. This feature can be toggled on/off by adding the following section and feature toggle in appsettings.json.\n\u0026#34;FeatureManagement\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;NewPdfGeneration\u0026#34;: true } This will call the new PDF service which accepts a URL pointing back to an automatic generated page in the app. The rendered page is then used as the foundation for the PDF. The IPdfFormatter as documented below is still relevant if you need custom logic for excluding components/pages from PDF.\nSettings While the default settings for the new service should be enough for most applications they can be overridden by adding a PdfGeneratorSettings section in appsettings.json (default settings shown below).\n\u0026#34;PdfGeneratorSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ServiceEndpointUri\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://{org}.apps.{hostName}/{appId}/#/instance/{instanceId}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AppPdfPageUriTemplate\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://{org}.apps.{hostName}/{appId}/#/instance/{instanceId}?pdf=1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;WaitForSelector\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#readyForPrint\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;WaitForTime\u0026#34;: 5000 } If the WaitForSelector is set, the WaitForTime will be ignored. The WaitForSelector ensures that the page will be completely rendered before the PDF is generated.\nThere are two different methods of configuring the generation of PDFs:\nAutomatically based on your form layouts Manually by defining a custom PDF layout (v7.5+ only) It is also possible to get a preview of what the PDF will look like in the browser while developing (v7.5+ only).\nAutomatic configuration This method is used by default unless you specify a custom PDF layout file. This method extracts all of your pages and components in the order they appear, and displays them in the PDF document.\nNOTE: This method does not include any summary components from your layout files.\nExcluding pages and components Often, you will need to exclude certain pages or components that are not relevant to the PDF document. This is can be configured in two different ways:\nBy modifying the Settings.json file for your layout set. Programmatically by implementing it in code. This allows for dynamic exclusion depending on the form data. Depending on the version you are using, the programmatic method is set up differently, but the logic is the same. See below how to set this up for the version you are on: v7 Create a class that implements the IPdfFormatter interface found in the Altinn.App.Core.Features.Pdf namespace.\nYou can name and place the file in any folder you like within your project, but we suggest you use meaningful namespaces like in any other .Net project. Register you custom implementation in the Program.cs class. services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IPdfFormatter, PdfFormatter\u0026gt;(); This ensures your custom code is known to the application and that it will be executed. v4, v5, v6 Modify the PdfHandler.cs file under App/logic/Print. Vis/skjul innhold Excluding pages 1.

Using Altinn Studio You can add a custom PDF layout in Studio by converting a page to a PDF layout in the page configuration:\nIf you add a Summary component to this page, you can specify what parts of the layout you want to include in the PDF.\nManual configuration This method lets you fully customize the generated PDF by using a layout file to specify what it should contain.\nTo use this method you need to create a new layout file for the PDF and set pdfLayoutName in Settings.json to point to that file:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;page1\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;pdfLayoutName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myPdfLayout\u0026#34; } } This layout file is configured in exactly the same way as any other layout file, except that not all component types are allowed. The component types that can be used for a PDF layout file are the following:\nSummary Group InstanceInformation Header Paragraph Image Panel Vis/skjul innhold Including instance information The automatic layout includes a front page with instance information like sender, receiver, date sent, and reference number. This information should also be included in your custom layout. The example below shows how to include this information in exactly same way as in the automatic method:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;pdf-instance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;InstanceInformation\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;elements\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;dateSent\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;sender\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;receiver\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;referenceNumber\u0026#34;: true }, \u0026#34;pageBreak\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;breakAfter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;always\u0026#34; } }, ... ] } } Vis/skjul innhold Adding page breaks You can specify that a component should start on a new page or that a page break should occur immediately following a component using the pageBreak property. This property can be applied to any component. In the example below it is applied to a header to have a different section start on a new page:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;pdf-header\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Header\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;This is a new section\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;L\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pageBreak\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;breakBefore\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;always\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;breakAfter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;avoid\u0026#34; } } ] } } Note: The value of breakBefore and breakAfter can either be auto (default), always, avoid, or an expression returning any of these values.\nVis/skjul innhold Exclude child components from groups It is possible to exclude child components from a group by using the excludedChildren property on a Summary component pointing to a Group component. This is done by adding the child component ID to the list of excluded components like in the following example:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;pdf-group-summary\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-group-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;excludedChildren\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;some-child-component\u0026#34; ] } ] } } Preview in the browser This preview is only applicable to the new PDF generation method (v7.5+). See above for more information. It is possible to get a preview of what the generated PDF will look like in the browser while you are developing. Follow the instructions below:\nImportant: Use Google Chrome to preview the PDF.\nThe PDF generator uses a version of Chrome to generate the PDF, and other browsers will not produce the correct result. Start your app locally or open your app in the test environment, and start an instance. Open the developer tools by clicking the button in the bottom right corner, or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+K/⌘+Shift+K. Click the Forhåndsvis PDF (Preview PDF) button in the developer tools panel. PDF footer This feature is only compatible wth version 8.3.8 and higher. Prerequisites In order to use the PDF footer feature, your application needs to add support for globalization timezones. This is done by adding the following lines to the Dockerfile:\n# Add globalization timezone support RUN apk add --no-cache icu-libs icu-data-full tzdata ENV DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=false The lines must be added after the \u0026ldquo;FROM\u0026rdquo; section ending with \u0026ldquo;AS final\u0026rdquo;.\nConfiguration You can add a footer to the generated PDF by adding \u0026quot;DisplayFooter\u0026quot;: true to the PdfGeneratorSettings section in the appsettings.json file.\n\u0026#34;PdfGeneratorSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;DisplayFooter\u0026#34;: true } Content The footer will contain the following information:\nThe name of the app\nThe name of the organization\nThe date and time the PDF was generated\nThe Altinn reference ID\nThe page number\nPrototype PDF in Figma If you want to test and set up your PDF, you can do it here:\nAltinn Studio Komponenter.\nNote that the example is not identical to the actual code but has been adapted to create prototypes in Figma.\n"

The process tasks that come as standard implement the IProcessTask interface, and in principle you can create your own implementations of this. It is recommended that you contact us if this is considered relevant.\nService task Service tasks require at least version 8.9.0 of the Altinn NuGet packages. A service task is a process task that runs automatically on the server. As a general rule, the process moves on to the next step when it has finished running, but the service task can define this itself. Examples of standard service tasks include PDF generation and eFormidling.\nService owners can implement their own service tasks and add them as steps in the app\u0026rsquo;s process.\nHow to do it\n"

} Writing data As mentioned, we need to manually create the data element when the application enters the Task_1 process step.\nTo do this, use the UpdateOrCreateData method from the RestrictedDataHelper service.\nThe following example implements this logic in the IProcessTaskStart interface, fetching information from a fictional API and storing it in the restricted data model. This information remains unavailable to the user but can be retrieved later by the app.\nApp/logic/ProcessTaskStartHandler.cs public class ProcessTaskStartHandler( RestrictedDataHelper restrictedDataHelper, ISomeTaxService someTaxService ) : IProcessTaskStart { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// This method will execute when the process enters task step \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34; /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public async Task Start(string taskId, Instance instance, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { if (taskId != \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;) return; var taxPrefill = await someTaxService.GetTaxPrefillData(instance); var restrictedData = new RestrictedDataModel { Spouse = new Spouse { Name = taxPrefill.Spouse?.Name, NationalIdentityNumber = taxPrefill.Spouse?.NationalIdentityNumber, GrossIncome = taxPrefill.Spouse?.Income, GrossDebt = taxPrefill.Spouse?.Debt, } }; await restrictedDataHelper.UpdateOrCreateData( restrictedData, \u0026#34;restrictedDataModel\u0026#34;, instance ); } } Reading data In the following code, we have created an implementation of the IDataWriteProcessor interface, where we perform a fictional tax calculation. This calculation requires information we previously stored in the restricted data model, so we use RestrictedDataHelper.GetOrCreateData to retrieve it.\nApp/logic/DataWriteHandler.cs public class DataWriteHandler( RestrictedDataHelper restrictedDataHelper, ISomeTaxService someTaxService ) : IDataWriteProcessor { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// This method will execute when the user updates the income portion of the form /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public async Task ProcessDataWrite( IInstanceDataMutator instanceDataMutator, string taskId, DataElementChanges changes, string? language ) { var formChanges = changes.FormDataChanges.FirstOrDefault(x =\u0026gt; x.DataType.Id == \u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34; ); if (formChanges is null) return; var previousData = formChanges.PreviousFormData as MainDataModel; var currentData = formChanges.CurrentFormData as MainDataModel; if (currentData is null || currentData.Income.Equals(previousData?.Income)) return; var (restrictedData, _) = await restrictedDataHelper.GetOrCreateData\u0026lt;RestrictedDataModel\u0026gt;( \u0026#34;restrictedDataModel\u0026#34;, instanceDataMutator.Instance ); var taxRate = await someTaxService.GetTaxRateForHousehold( currentData.Income, restrictedData.Spouse, instanceDataMutator.Instance ); currentData.TaxRate = taxRate.CalculatedRate; } } "

	"content": " Available from v8.6.0 What is runtime delegated signing? By runtime delegated signing, we mean an app where those who need to sign are granted rights during the form-filling process.\nTypically, the app will ask the form owner to provide the social security number and last name of the individuals who need to sign, or alternatively, the organization number if someone with signing authority within a company needs to sign.\nOnce the form is fully completed, the user presses \u0026ldquo;Submit for signing\u0026rdquo;. The app will then delegate rights and send a message to the inbox in Altinn. The recipient may also be notified via email and SMS, depending on the configuration.\nPrerequisites Maskinporten Maskinporten is required both for the messaging service and the interaction with restricted data.\nFor runtime delegated signing, your Maskinporten client must have access to the following scopes:\naltinn:correspondence.read altinn:correspondence.write altinn:serviceowner/instances.read altinn:serviceowner/instances.write The correspondence-scopes are used when the app sends correspondence messages to signees as a call to action. The serviceowner scopes are used for internal state and bookkeeping in the app.\nIf you need help setting up a Maskinporten integration for your app, you can find all the information you need in this guide.\nCorrespondence Runtime delegated signing depends on the messaging service (Correspondence) in Altinn, which requires separate configuration.\nThe message service is used to tell the signee that they have been asked to sign a form in Altinn, and to send them a receipt of what they signed when the signature has been submitted.\nSee how to get started in this guide.\nExample Application In the following repository, you can find an example of an application with runtime delegated signing.\nThe main flow is:\nThe form filler enters the personal identification number and last name of the individuals who need to sign, or alternatively, the organization number if it is a company. Once the form is completed, the filler clicks a \u0026ldquo;Go to signing\u0026rdquo; button, which moves the process to the signing step. During the signing step, the application calls an implementation of the interface ISigneeProvider to determine who should be delegated access to sign. The signers are delegated rights and receive a notification that they have a signing task. The signers find the form in their inbox, open it, review the data, and click \u0026ldquo;Sign.\u0026rdquo; The submitter also signs if the app is configured this way and then submits the form. Below are the key configuration steps for setting up such an application.\n1. Add and configure a signing task in the app process Manual setup Extend the application process with a signing task A signing task must be added to App/config/process/process.bpmn, as shown in the example below.\nWe recommend doing this using the Altinn Studio process editor, so that the BPMN diagram is generated, to show the apps process. However, as of now, the process editor will only partially configure this task correctly, so some manual adjustments are required.\nSigning uses two user actions.\nsign: The actual signing action. reject: If the signing step should be cancellable, a gateway must also be added to control where the process should continue. See the example below. If the Altinn user interface is used by the application, these actions will be triggered by button clicks in the signing stage. If only the API is used, they must be triggered manually via the /actions endpoint or the process next endpoint.\n\u0026lt;bpmn:task id=\u0026#34;SigningTask\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;Signering\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskType\u0026gt;signing\u0026lt;/altinn:taskType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action\u0026gt;sign\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action\u0026gt;reject\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:signatureConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!-- The actual data that should be signed.

This ensures that these data items cannot be edited via the app\u0026rsquo;s API but only by the app itself.\nThe IDs of the data types must match the IDs set for signatureDataType and signeeStatesDataTypeId in the process configuration.\nAccess control for users Give read, write and optionally sign to the role that should fill out the form.\nMore information about action attributes can be found here.\nAccess control for the app In order for the service to be able to delegate access rights to the signees, the app itself needs to have the right to delegate the read and sign actions.\nBelow is an example of a policy rule that accomplishes this. For the code to work in your own app, please follow these steps:\nReplace ttd with the correct org. Replace app_ttd_signering-brukerstyrt with your own org and app name inserted into this template: app_{org}_{app-name}.

Support for configuration in Altinn Studio Designer will come later. Take a look at the \u0026ldquo;Manual setup\u0026rdquo;-tab for this section for guidance.\n2. Add a signing layout set Manual setup Add a task layout folder under App/ui for your signing task. In the following examples, we will call this folder signing.\nIn the folder you created, add a layouts folder and a Settings.json file.\nAdd a new file called signing.json in the layouts folder.\nThe folder structure should look like this:\nApp/ ├── ui/ │ └── signing/ │ ├── layouts/ │ │ └── signing.json │ └── Settings.json There are standard components that can be used to build a layout set for a signing step. You are not required to use these components, but it\u0026rsquo;s recommended.\nSigneeList: Lists the signees and their signing status. Read more here. SigningDocumentList: Lists the data being signed. For example attachments, xml-data or a PDF summary from an earlier step. Read more here. SigningActions: Determines the current status of the signing task and present relevant information and buttons to the end user, for instance the \u0026ldquo;Sign\u0026rdquo;-button. Read more here. If you choose not to use the SigningActions to display the \u0026ldquo;Sign\u0026rdquo;-button, you must as a minimum add an action button with action sign, to allow the end user to sign.\nExample of usage of the standard components:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;headerSigningFounders\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Header\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;M\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Her kan man ha en overskrift\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;signee-list\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SigneeList\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Personer som skal signere\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Personer som skal signere beskrivelse\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;help\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dette er personer som skal signere\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;signing-documents\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SigningDocumentList\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dokumenter som skal signeres\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dokumenter som skal signeres beskrivelse\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;signing-state\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SigningActions\u0026#34; } ] } } Update App/ui/layout-sets.json with the id of the task folder you just created.\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout-sets.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sets\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;form\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34; ] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;signing\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;SigningTask\u0026#34; ] } ] } Altinn Studio Designer This step needs to be done manually. Support for configuration in Altinn Studio Designer will come later. Take a look at the \u0026ldquo;Manual setup\u0026rdquo;-tab for this section for guidance.\n3. Optional - Custom validation You can use the default validator as mentioned in step 2. It verifies that the number of signatures meets at least the minCount set in the data model configuration. Custom validation can be set up by implementing the IValidator or ITaskValidator interface as described in How to add custom validation.\nNote that if you configure the app to execute the sign action on the process next call, the action will be done before the validation.\nA fictitious example is a validator which verifies that at minimum one signature is done on behalf of an organisation:\npublic class SigningTaskValidator : IValidator { private readonly IProcessReader _processReader; public SigningTaskValidator(IProcessReader processReader) { _processReader = processReader; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// We implement \u0026lt;see cref=\u0026#34;ShouldRunForTask\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; instead. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public string TaskId =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;*\u0026#34;; /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Only runs for tasks that are of type \u0026#34;signing\u0026#34;. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public bool ShouldRunForTask(string taskId) { AltinnTaskExtension? taskConfig; try { taskConfig = _processReader.GetAltinnTaskExtension(taskId); } catch (Exception) { return false; } return taskConfig?.TaskType == \u0026#34;signing\u0026#34;; } public bool NoIncrementalValidation =\u0026gt; true; /// \u0026lt;inheritdoc /\u0026gt; public Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; HasRelevantChanges(IInstanceDataAccessor dataAccessor, string taskId, DataElementChanges changes) { throw new UnreachableException( \u0026#34;HasRelevantChanges should not be called because NoIncrementalValidation is true.\u0026#34; ); } /// \u0026lt;inheritdoc /\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;remarks\u0026gt;Validates that at minimum one signature is done on behalf of an organisation.\u0026lt;/remarks\u0026gt; public async Task\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;ValidationIssue\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Validate( IInstanceDataAccessor instanceDataAccessor, string taskId, string? language ) { AltinnSignatureConfiguration signatureConfiguration = _processReader.GetAltinnTaskExtension(taskId)?.SignatureConfiguration ?? throw new ApplicationConfigException(\u0026#34;Signing configuration not found in AltinnTaskExtension\u0026#34;); string signatureDataTypeId = signatureConfiguration.SignatureDataType ?? throw new ApplicationConfigException(\u0026#34;SignatureDataType is not set in the signature configuration.\u0026#34;); DataType signatureDataType = instanceDataAccessor.GetDataType(signatureDataTypeId); // Set authentication override for the signature data, since this is a restricted type instanceDataAccessor.OverrideAuthenticationMethod(signatureDataType, StorageAuthenticationMethod.ServiceOwner()); IEnumerable\u0026lt;DataElement\u0026gt; signatureDataElements = instanceDataAccessor.GetDataElementsForType( signatureDataType ); SignDocument[] signDocuments = await Task.WhenAll( signatureDataElements.Select(async signatureDataElement =\u0026gt; { ReadOnlyMemory\u0026lt;byte\u0026gt; data = await instanceDataAccessor.GetBinaryData(signatureDataElement); string signDocumentSerialized = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(data.ToArray()); return JsonSerializer.Deserialize\u0026lt;SignDocument\u0026gt;(signDocumentSerialized) ?? throw new JsonException(\u0026#34;Could not deserialize signature document.\u0026#34;); }) ); var organisationHasSigned = signDocuments.Any(doc =\u0026gt; doc?.SigneeInfo?.OrganisationNumber is not null); if (organisationHasSigned is false) { return [ new ValidationIssue { Code = \u0026#34;SignatureIssues\u0026#34;, Severity = ValidationIssueSeverity.Error, Description = \u0026#34;An organisation must sign the document.\u0026#34;, }, ]; } return []; } } 4. Tell the app who the signees are Manual setup To allow the app to determine who should receive access to read and sign, the C# interface ISigneeProvider must be implemented.\nThe implementation must return a set of individuals and/or organizations that should receive rights to sign. This can be based on the data model, as shown in the example below.\nWhen an organization is provided as a signee, any person with a key role for the organization will be given access to read and sign.\nThe Id property in this implementation must match the ID specified in \u0026lt;altinn:signeeProviderId\u0026gt;.\n#nullable enable using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Features.Signing; using Altinn.App.Models.Skjemadata; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.logic; public class FounderSigneesProvider : ISigneeProvider { public string Id { get; init; } = \u0026#34;founders\u0026#34;; public async Task\u0026lt;SigneeProviderResult\u0026gt; GetSignees(GetSigneesParameters parameters) { DataElement dataElement = parameters.InstanceDataAccessor .GetDataElementsForType(\u0026#34;Skjemadata\u0026#34;) .Single(); var formData = await parameters.InstanceDataAccessor.GetFormData\u0026lt;Skjemadata\u0026gt;(dataElement); List\u0026lt;ProvidedSignee\u0026gt; providedSignees = []; foreach (StifterPerson stifterPerson in formData.StifterPerson) { var personSignee = new ProvidedPerson { FullName = string.Join( \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, [stifterPerson.Fornavn, stifterPerson.Mellomnavn, stifterPerson.Etternavn] ), SocialSecurityNumber = stifterPerson.Foedselsnummer?.ToString() ?? string.Empty, // CommunicationConfig added here is optional, shown and described in section 6 }; providedSignees.Add(personSignee); } foreach (StifterVirksomhet stifterVirksomhet in formData.StifterVirksomhet) { var organisationSignee = new ProvidedOrganization { Name = stifterVirksomhet.Navn, OrganizationNumber = stifterVirksomhet.Organisasjonsnummer?.ToString() ?? string.Empty, // CommunicationConfig added here is optional, shown and described in section 6 }; providedSignees.Add(organisationSignee); } return new SigneeProviderResult { Signees = providedSignees }; } } Altinn Studio Designer This step needs to be done manually.

You can name these whatever you want and connect them to CommunicationConfig in the next step (step 6).\nExample of text resources for notifications with custom texts for email, as well as receipt:\nPlease note that the text resources for the Altinn inbox message contain an $instanceUrl$ placeholder. This placeholder will be replaced with a link to the form instance, which is crucial in order for the user to access the correct form. { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;signing.correspondence_title_common\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task - Sign founding documents\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;signing.correspondence_summary_stifter_person\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;You have been added as a signee.\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;signing.correspondence_summary_stifter_organisation\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;The organisation has been added as a signee.\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;signing.correspondence_body_stifter_person\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;You have been added as a signee for founding documents. \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; $instanceUrl$ \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;signing.correspondence_body_stifter_organisation\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Your organisation has been added as a signee for founding documents. \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt; $instanceUrl$ \u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;signing.notification_content\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hello $correspondenceRecipientName$,\\n\\nYou have received founding documents for signing in Altinn.

Optional - Customize how to notify the signees Note that CommunicationConfig is optional. Here you may override the standard texts used in communication with the signees, as explained in the previous section. You may also override the email address and phone number for the signees.\nBy default, a message will be sent to the signees altinn inbox with a link to the relevant application instance and a notification will be sent via email. The default texts described in the previous section will be used. If not overridden, the email addresses and the phone numbers used are populated as described in Recipient lookup and Address lookup.\nThese are the possible override configurations for the signee communication:\nProperty Description Type CommunicationConfig The object for communication configuration Object CommunicationConfig.InboxMessage The object for inbox message configuration Object CommunicationConfig.InboxMessage.TitleTextResourceKey The text resource key for the inbox message title String CommunicationConfig.InboxMessage.SummaryTextResourceKey The text resource key for the inbox message summary String CommunicationConfig.InboxMessage.BodyTextResourceKey The text resource key for the inbox message body String CommunicationConfig.Notification The object for notification configuration Object CommunicationConfig.Notification.Email The object for email notification configuration Object CommunicationConfig.Notification.Email.EmailAddress The text resource key for the email address String CommunicationConfig.Notification.Email.SubjectTextResourceKey The text resource key for the email subject String CommunicationConfig.Notification.Email.BodyTextResourceKey The text resource key for the email body String CommunicationConfig.Notification.Sms The object for sms notification configuration Object CommunicationConfig.Notification.Sms.MobileNumber The text resource key for the mobile number String CommunicationConfig.Notification.Sms.BodyTextResourceKey The text resource key for the sms body String CommunicationConfig.Notification.NotificationChoice The notification preferrence choice NotificationChoice enum (String) Manual setup The following is an example of overriding the communication with a ProvidedPerson, the same is valid for a ProvidedOrganization:\nvar personSignee = new ProvidedPerson { CommunicationConfig = new CommunicationConfig { InboxMessage = new InboxMessage { TitleTextResourceKey = \u0026#34;signing.correspondence_title_common\u0026#34;, SummaryTextResourceKey = \u0026#34;signing.correspondence_summary_stifter_organisasjon\u0026#34;, BodyTextResourceKey = \u0026#34;signing.correspondence_body_stifter_organisasjon\u0026#34; }, Notification = new Notification { Email = new Email { EmailAddress = stifterVirksomhet.Epost, SubjectTextResourceKey = \u0026#34;signing.email_subject\u0026#34;, BodyTextResourceKey = \u0026#34;signing.notification_content\u0026#34;.Replace( \u0026#34;{0}\u0026#34;, stifterVirksomhet.Navn ), }, Sms = new Sms { MobileNumber = stifterVirksomhet.Mobiltelefon, BodyTextResourceKey = \u0026#34;signing.notification_content\u0026#34;.Replace( \u0026#34;{0}\u0026#34;, stifterVirksomhet.Navn ), }, NotificationChoice = NotificationChoice.EmailPreferred, } } } Altinn Studio Designer This step needs to be done manually. Support for configuration in Altinn Studio Designer will come later. Take a look at the \u0026ldquo;Manual setup\u0026rdquo;-tab for this section for guidance.\n7. Testing SMS notifications are not available in TT02 and other test environments. If used, this vil lead to a \u0026ldquo;notification failed\u0026rdquo; status in the SigneeList component. The signee will still receive a message in their altinn inbox. Authorization caching may cause delays in users seeing delegated forms in their Altinn inbox if they were logged in when delegation occurred. To avoid this, delegate access to a user not used in testing for the last hour.\n"

The different scenarios below can to some extent be combined with each other, but many services will only need one of them.\nRuntime delegated signing By runtime delegated signing, we mean an app where those who need to sign are granted rights during the form-filling process.\nTypically, the app will ask the form owner to provide the social security number and last name of the individuals who need to sign, or alternatively, the organization number if someone with signing authority within a company needs to sign.\nOnce the form is fully completed, the user presses \u0026ldquo;Submit for signing\u0026rdquo;. The app will then delegate rights and send a message to the inbox in Altinn. The recipient may also be notified via email and SMS, depending on the configuration.\nHow to configure\nRole/access package-based signing By role and access package based signing, we mean a service where individuals who need to sign have the right to read and sign due to a role or access package they hold. For example a CEO, accountant or auditor.\nHow to configure\nSign and submit This is a scenario where the form instance owner is supposed to sign the data at the same time as submitting the form.

Further descriptions of the solution architecture related to advanced use cases and possible future extensions will build on this foundation architecture.\nGuiding Architecture Principles Overarching architectural principles for digitization of the public sector The overarching architectural principles for digitization of the public sector in Norway are a support for work with enterprise architecture and are intended to contribute to increased interoperability across enterprises and sectors.\nThese high level principals apply.\nGeneral Altinn 3 Architecture Principles The Altinn 3 Architecture Principles apply.\nFurther considerations Altinn 3 Broker is one of several Digdir products within the product groups for Messaging and Data Sharing. Architecture principles for these product groups are under construction.\nPending architecture principles for the relevant procuct areas, here are some important considerations for the Altinn 3 Broker solution architeture:\nSupport for on-premise hosting and data storage. Due to information security concerns, some customers will not tolerate cloud hosting and storage on the cloud platform chosen by Altinn. The solution architecture should therefore allow for on premise hosting and storage on a per customer basis.\nFuture readiness in general. The international landscape of regulations, standards, technologies and solutions is evolving. The solution architecture should take this into account, and prepare for compliance, interoperability and reuse. Examples: Semantic Web and Linked Data, Self Souvereign Identity and Verifiable Credentials.\nCompliance with EU regulations and standards. European regulations and standards for data sharing will apply for Norway in the coming years. Compliance will be mandated, and interoperability will be essential for cross border value chains.

The most relevant solutions are highlighted in bold.\nDigdir Solution Resources for Altinn 3 Broker Transition Architecture - Altinn 2 to Altinn 3 General Two migration options are supported for migration of Altinn Broker services - hard shift and soft switch.\nHard shift from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3 for all users of a service With the Hard shift option, all users and End User Systems make a coordinated shift to Altinn 3.\nThis option is recommended in cases where such a coordinated shift is feasible. No transition solution is needed and all features of Altinn 3 may be used as soon as the shift has been made.\nUploaded files are stored om Altinn 2 Broker File Storage up until the shift.\nAltinn 3 Broker Migration Option - Hard Shift Note: In this case, it is assumed that Altinn 2 Broker files have been purged and are not needed in Altinn 3 Broker. However, if required, it will be possible to move files from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3 Broker File Storage after the transition.\nSoft shift from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3 With the Soft shift option, users and End User Systems shift to Altinn 3 on an individual basis, when ready. The transition solution bridges between Altinn 2 and Altinn 3.\nDuring the transition period, uploaded files will always be stored on Altinn 3 Broker Storage.\nAltinn 3 Broker Migration Option - Soft Shift File storage Broker File Storage is based MS Azure Blob Storage, and isolated to a storage account per Service Owner.\nStored Files are always encrypted; ref.

	"description": "Lists of options that does not change, but can be filtered",
	"content": "For simpler use cases, a static list of options or a simple code list is easy to configure. These can either be set directly in the component configuration (in which case we call them options) or in a json file in the application repository (the simplest form for code lists). Which method to use depends on the need for reusability. If multiple components need to use the same set of options, it is recommended to use the json file method and thus turn it into a code list.\nNote that even though a list of options can be completely static, it is also possible to make it (a bit more) dynamic by filtering the options using expressions. If you want even more flexibility, you can also create your own code-based code list.\nIn component configuration (options) In the example configuration, a Dropdown component is set up with a simple set of options. The options property is an array of objects, where each object represents a choice for the user. The value property is the value that will be saved in the data model when the user selects the item. The label property is the text that will be displayed to the user.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-dropdown-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;soknad.nyGaranti.loyvetype\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Type 1\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Type 2\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Type 3\u0026#34; } ] } From JSON files (code list) By adding json based option files in the application repository, the application will automatically read the file and expose it through the options api. For this to work, the files must be placed in the App/options/ folder and be named according to the following conventions {optionId}.json for the application to recognize them.\nFor example if you have a list of countries in a file named countries.json, the optionId would be countries, and would be exposed through the api at {org}/{app}/api/options/countries.\nThe static code lists should be in the format as shown below:\n[ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;norway\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Norge\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;denmark\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Danmark\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sweden\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;country.label.sweden\u0026#34; } ] Note that the label property can be a key to a text resource (as shown above for sweden) or plain text.\nIn order to reference this code list in a component, you can use the optionsId property in the component configuration:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-dropdown-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;soknad.opphavsland\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;countries\u0026#34; } "

This guide explains how to create a table for a subform and configure the subform to be linked to it.\n2. Configuring the Subform Altinn Studio Designer The setup in this section is mainly done from the Utforming page in the app\u0026rsquo;s workspace. Navigate there by clicking on Utforming in the top menu. Add a table for the subform\nSelect Tabell for underskjema from the component list on the left in Avansert.\nWhen the table is added, a configuration window opens to guide you further. Create a subform\nFollow the instructions in the configuration window to create a new subform or select an existing one. Creating a subform - guide If you need to modify the data model for the subform, navigate to Datamodell in the top menu and select the data model from the dropdown list. In ther Metadata tab, you can specify the number of data elements the user can/should add to the subform. Click Generer to save the changes. Select the subform on the Utforming page\nSelect the subform in the dropdown menu linked to the table. Alternatively, you can navigate there by clicking on Utform underskjemaet in the configuration window. Set up the subform\nAdd the components you want. The Knapp for å lukke underskjema component, which closes and navigates back to the main form, is automatically added to each page. Remove it manually on pages where it is not needed. Add columns to the table for the subform\nNavigate back to the main form and click on Tabell for underskjema. Open the accordion Tekster and add the desired columns. Configure the columns\nChoose the number of columns you want in the table. Select a component from the subform for each column. You can add a custom title, otherwise the component\u0026rsquo;s title is used. Click Lagre when you are done. Column configuration Manuelt oppsett This documentation is a work in progess. Subforms are currently in preview-release. Subforms are contained in a subform table. Let us go through configuring a subform table and the subform contained within.\nCreate a data model for the subform. You should now see the three files under App/model. The c# class, the json schema and the xsd. Set appLogic.allowInSubform to true in applicationMetadata.json. Create a folder under App/ui with your desired subform name. In the subform folder, add a Settings.json file and a folder called layouts. You can add page layouts to the layouts folder as you would for the main form. Subforms do not support attachments, and nesting subforms is not allowed (subform in subform). The Settings.json file for the sub form is configured as normal. The button which closes the subform must be a CustomButton with a closeSubform action. Optionally you can also trigger validation before exiting. { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;subform-exitbutton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CustomButton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;The button title\u0026#34; // Defaults to `general.done` if omitted }, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ClientAction\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;closeSubform\u0026#34;, // Validation is optional \u0026#34;validation\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;page\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;all\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;show\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;All\u0026#34;] } } ] } Add a layout set to layout-sets.json with the data type of the data model from step 1.

	"content": "How does testing with Maskinporten work When interacting with Maskinporten in an application there are a few things to keep in mind.\nFirst and foremost Samarbeidsportalen lets you maintain two different clients; one for test being ver2/test and another for production being prod. You should create both clients, but of course only use the test client for test, and prod client for production. Which client to use in which scenario, is decided by different configurations for the appsettings.{env}.json files. There are different access policies for creating these, so make sure you are aware of these limitations described at Samarbeidsportalen.\nSecond, since integrating this client with an Altinn app relies on authorizing through public and private keys (JWT) stored as Azure secrets, you will need access to the Azure Key vault of the organization owning the applications.\nWhat can be done in Studio The Studio support for developing multi-app solutions are currently very limited. Thus, the only help Studio can provide for you is the already supported single-app configurations. This means that you will only be able to build the individual applications and visualize the looks of them in the preview tool.\nWhat can be done in app-localtest When running the application locally in app-localtest you can test all the logic in application A until the point where the instantiation request to application B is triggered. The reason for this is that the AppClient tries to access the Azure key vault in order to get the secrets needed for authorization to Maskinporten. But the secrets needed to be allowed to access Azure key vault is not available when running in localtest.\nHowever, there is a way to go around this, for testing purposes. The secrets needed, clientID and encodedJWT, for authorizing requests to Maskinporten can be copied from your organisations Azure key vault and temporarily be pasted into the appsettings.json file.\nIf doing this modification be very careful that these secrets must not be shared by pushing them to gitea. After this modification the application is set up correctly with a client that can be authorized with Maskinporten when sending the instantiation request to application B. However, this request will not be executed successfully due to application B is not running. App-localtest is limited to only handle one running application, but if application B is running in the environment, preferably in tt02 during test, you can change the request to point to this environment instead of local.altinn.cloud. This can be done by changing the envUrl in the AppClient.CreateNewInstance() method.\nChange this line:\nstring envUrl = $\u0026#34;https://{org}.apps.{_settings.HostName}\u0026#34;; To this:\nstring envUrl = $\u0026#34;https://{org}.apps.tt02\u0026#34;; NB: Do not change the HostName variable in appsettings.json since this is used for other critical purposes as well.\nUnless you are fine by injecting your organizations Altinn Innboks with testing instances of application B, you should adjust the receiver of the instance that is to be created in the instance template in application A. This is done by using PersonNumber instead of OrganisationNumber in the InstanceOwner part of the template object in ProcessTaskEnd.End() method. It is recommended to use a person number for a test user from Tenor test database. When testing if the application B form has come through you will need to log in to tt02.altinn.no with the same tenor test user.\nWhat must be done in tt02 Before actually deploying the applications to production the forms should have been tested fully in tt02 with actual usage of Azure key vault and correct variable for the envUrl. This means that both applications should be tested while running in tt02. It is still possible to test with a tenor test user as the receiver of the instance, but an alternative is to ask for a test-organisation that can receive these forms. This can be done by sending a request to servicedesk@altinn.no.\n"

	"description": "Learn how write actions are used to provide a more integrated user experience",
	"content": "Introduction Write actions are a way to allow GUI actions to perform a state changing operation directly from browser based end-user systems without the need for a full page navigation, allowing for a more cohesive user experience.\nBackground All actions defined on a dialog are effectively URLs pointing to the service provider system that must be requested in some way by the end-user system when the user indicates that action is to be performed. While custom end-user systems implementing API-actions can invoke both read and write operations using all available HTTP methods and input/output models, browser based end-user systems implementing GUI-actions are by default constrained to read operations (ie. navigate to a page, or download a file) using HTTP GET methods.\nCross-origin full page navigation is perhaps the most central feature of the web, and is, unlike \u0026ldquo;state changing\u0026rdquo; operations such as HTTP POSTs, not constrained by web browsers due to security reasons. This is what makes it possible to implement single-sign-on mechanisms in ID-porten and session initialization (all of which involves several browser redirects) at the remote service provider system. This allows for seamless deep-linking between browser based end-user systems (eg. Arbeidsflate) and the user-facing GUI parts of the service provider systems.\nHowever, performing a cross-origin POST, ie. submitting a form to an endpoint on a different server, while relying on the same SSO and session intialization mechanisms is (both in modern web browsers as well as in ID-porten) not possible. This is by design, and to avoid security issues stemming from cross-site request forgery (CSRF).\nCustom end user systems utilizing the API actions and Maskinporten/system user authentication are not constrained by this, as these are security measures put in place by web browsers, and not inherently constraints of the HTTP protocol. This is usually not a problem, as most GUI-actions in Dialogporten are meant to be full page navigations, such as \u0026ldquo;Go to form fill-out\u0026rdquo;, where all the state changing operations are implemented. But some actions does not require any particular input, nor does it produce any particularly interesting output. Actions such as \u0026ldquo;Confirm message read\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Cancel process\u0026rdquo;, would with a normal GUI action require the user to 1) perform a full page navigation to the remote system, 2) perform the actual state changing operation there, and wait for a confirmation before 3) navigating back to the (now presumably updated) dialog.\nWhile this works, it is not a very cohesive user experience as it involves intermediate steps and navigations, which from a user point of might seem unnecessary.\nThe solution As with front channel embeds, write actions leverage the dialog token mechanism to allow browser based enduser system to directly invoke the URL associated with the action in the background, ie. without performing a full page navigation. While the request is undergoing, the end user system might show a spinner or similar progress indicator. Upon completion, end-users will be presented with the updated dialog view. In case of errors (either technical or business logic-related), an error message can be displayed.\nDialogporten does not know the semantics associated with an action, so for actions that involve complex mutations of the dialog, the service owner must perform the change, update the dialog in the background, and then return a successful response in the request made by the end-user system. This will trigger the end-user to reload the (now updated) dialog from Dialogporten, and display the new state to the user. There are also mechanisms to allow the for the dialog change to occur asynchronously (delayed) and independent on the request made by the end-user system, transparent to the end-user. See the reference section for technical details.\nRead more\nTechnical reference for front-channel embeds "

By role and access package based signing, we mean a service where individuals who need to sign have the right to read and sign due to a role or access package they hold. For example a CEO, accountant or auditor.\nPrerequisites Maskinporten Maskinporten is required if you wish to use the message service and/or place access restrictions on the signature objects.\nIf you need help setting up a Maskinporten integration for your app, you can find all the information you need in this guide.\nCorrespondence If your app is configured to send signature receipts, the Altinn message service (Correspondence) must be enabled.\nSee how to get started in this guide.\n1. Add a signing task to the app process, with related configuration Manual setup Extend the app process with a signing task A signing task must be added to App/config/process/process.bpmn, as illustrated below.\nWe recommend doing this using the Altinn Studio process editor, so that the BPMN diagram is updated to show the new app flow. Please note that the process editor to date does not handle all aspects of the signing configuration, which means that some manual setup is still required. Signing normally uses two user actions. If the Altinn user interface is used by the app, these will be called by button pressen in the signing step. If only the API is used, these must be called manually via the /actions endpoint or via process next.\nsign: The actual act of signing the data. Performed by the signees. reject: If the end user sees something wrong with the signing step, they can abort the signing step. All signatures and the signee state is deleted, and runtime delegated access rights are revoked.

It’s possible to use the signing functionality using only API calls, without using the Altinn user interface.\nPrerequisites If the service should send a signature receipt to the inbox of the signee, the Altinn message service (Correspondence) must be enabled.\nConfiguring signing You can see how to configure signing in an app using the guides found here. API-based signing has the same requirements for configuration, except the layout-set for the signing step can be simpler.\nThe most important API calls Perform single signing If only one person should sign in a signing step, you can use the \u0026ldquo;process next\u0026rdquo; endpoint:\nPUT /{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid}/process/next\nBody:\n{ \u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sign\u0026#34; } In this case, the process will automatically navigate to the next step once the signature has been saved. When using this endpoint you need to have multiple signing steps if more than one party should sign.\nPerform parallel signing If multiple signees should sign in parallel, the following endpoint can be used instead of \u0026ldquo;process next\u0026rdquo;:\nPOST /{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid}/actions\nBody:\n{ \u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sign\u0026#34; } In this case, the process will still be in the signing step after the signature has been saved, and more signees can sign before the process is continued using a \u0026ldquo;process next\u0026rdquo; call.\nInformation about signees and signatures If runtime-delegated signing is configured, the following endpoint can be used to get a list of the signees and their signing status. The endpoint can also be used when runtime-delegated signing is not used, but then it will only return signees that have already performed the sign action. It will then function as a signature list.\nGET /{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid}/signing\nExample response before any signing has been done, where one person and one organisation is supposed to sign:\n{ \u0026#34;signeeStates\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;BØYLEHEST MATT\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organisation\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;delegationSuccessful\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;notificationStatus\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Sent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;partyId\u0026#34;: 51281269, \u0026#34;signedTime\u0026#34;: null }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;organisation\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;LYDIG VENNLIG KATT KJERNE\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;delegationSuccessful\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;notificationStatus\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Sent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;partyId\u0026#34;: 51843877, \u0026#34;signedTime\u0026#34;: null } ] } The same response after the signing has been done.

	"content": "Digdir has conducted a review of the legal situation and made assessments of the possible privacy implications of using a cloud service provider for the operation of Altinn.\nDigdir mostly operates in the role of a data processor in Altinn. The service owners participating in the Altinn cooperation are each data controllers for their services. Therefore, they must make their own assessments for their specific services in Altinn.\nHowever, Digdir is also the data controller for personal data processed in the common functionality of Altinn, and we have accounted for risks and measures related to the processing of these – as well as the processing we do for service owners in the role of data processor.\nWe have assessed the intelligence risk and the supplier\u0026rsquo;s standard terms. We have looked at the likelihood and consequence of breaches of information security that would have led to privacy implications. In addition, we have assessed the rights and freedoms of the registered individuals. Especially against the European Convention on Human Rights.\nChoosing to use a cloud service provider has some unique risks for information security and privacy, but we have assessed that the risk picture does not change compared to Altinn II, which is operated and managed \u0026ldquo;on-prem\u0026rdquo;. There are also many advantages to using a cloud service provider.\nRegarding the risks, we have briefly accounted for some selected risk-reducing measures. However, it is important to compare the risks of using a cloud service provider against the risks that arise if one chooses other, and perhaps more local, service providers to operate Altinn. Entities such as the National Security Authority, the Norwegian Police Security Service, the Intelligence Service, and others, publish their threat assessments annually. There, threats are largely attributed to national-supported actors from some identified countries. Digdir\u0026rsquo;s assessment is that the information security and privacy of the population, after an overall assessment, are better safeguarded with a chosen contractual partner and international cloud service provider associated with a close ally – than the alternatives currently available on the European and Norwegian market.\nDigdir will continue to make ongoing assessments of risk, information security, and privacy implications for Altinn. We will stay updated on the threat landscape and the emergence of new technology. And will continue to work for responsible and safe digitization of Norway, in line with directives from the Storting and the Government.\n"

	"content": "Here is a brief summary of the consequences of the chosen transition and migration solution for the different parties:\nService Owner When creating the correspondence in the API, the correspondence is created in the environment being called (\u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo; of the element). If created in Altinn 2, migration will occur to Altinn 3 shortly thereafter, but notification will be completed in A2 regardless of migration. The correspondence is still available in Altinn 2 after migration. If in Altinn 3, the correspondence will be available in the Altinn 2 Portal. A3 correspondences will not be available via A2 API. Checking the status of a correspondence created in A2 must be done against A2 until it is migrated, and after migration you may check against either A3 or A2. We recommend you start using Altinn 3 APIs as soon as possible, and when the CorrespondenceSync solution is live, you should avoid using Altinn 2 APIs. For new correspondences created in Altinn 3, integration with Altinn 3 API is required to do the same. End Users Via Altinn 2 portal Will get a full overview in the Altinn portal of both Altinn 2 and 3 elements. When they open an Altinn 3 element, it is displayed in the Altinn 2 Portal, similar to an Altinn 2 element. Altinn 2 Portal will only give access to the Altinn 2-version of a migrated correspondence. Via End-User System Altinn 3 correspondences will be available once the End-User System has integrated with A3. Via Arbeidsflate Will get correspondences created in Altinn 3, as well as those that have been migrated from Altinn 2. Correspondences in Altinn 2 that have not been migrated will not be available since Arbeidsflate is based on Dialogporten, and Altinn 2 messages are not available in Dialogporten. End-User System To get a full overview of elements, integration with both Altinn 2 and Altinn 3 API is required. When elements are migrated from A2 to A3, it is possible to identify this by the A3 element containing the Altinn 2 Correspondence ID/ReporteeElementId/AR. When the element is migrated, the End-User System can continue working with it through either the Altinn 2 or Altinn 3 APIs. Changes to the messages will be synchronized, but be mindful that there may be some latency before the changes are synced. The EUS must ensure that they handle the migrated messages in a controlled fashion, and that they do not interact with both the Altinn 2 or Altinn 3 version of the element. We recommend that as soon as the CorrespondenceSync solution is live, that you stop using Altinn 2 APIs, and use solely Altinn 3 APIs. Dialogporten and Arbeidsflate Altinn 2 elements are not available in Dialogporten until after they have been migrated and a Dialog referencing the element has been created. Dialogporten / Arbeidsflate will decide when the migrated messages become available, and Team Melding og Formidling will be responsible for the technical implementation in Altinn 3 Correspondence to create dialogs and make the message available. During the phase \u0026ldquo;Ongoing migration and availability of messages\u0026rdquo;, the migration component for message data will automatically create the dialog as part of the operation to migrate fresh messages to Altinn 3 Correspondence.

	"content": "Migration of Altinn 2 Messages Altinn 3 Message largely has the same data model as Altinn 2 to enable mapping and migration. All Altinn 2 messages and attachments are migrated to Altinn 3 Message. All Altinn 2 message services with data will be created as Altinn 3 message services. Data and metadata are migrated to Altinn 3 in a process that is independent of making the elements available in the Dialogporten and Arbeidsflate. Making data available via the Altinn 3 API and Dialogporten/Arbeidsflate is done as a separate step after data migration is completed. Migration of delegations is done as a separate step but should be performed before messages are made available to end users in the A3 API and Dialogporten/Arbeidsflate. Migration of historical data will take time (weeks/months), and the transition solution is built with this in mind. Eventually, the migration job will \u0026ldquo;catch up\u0026rdquo; with live/fresh data, so the elements can be made available in Altinn 3 shortly after they were created in Altinn 2. Since changes can occur to migrated elements in both Altinn 2 and Altinn 3, these changes must be synchronized both ways, but there are certain limitations. Transition Solution To become independent of the production date for the new Arbeidsflate, Altinn 3 messages are made available in the Altinn 2 Portal for end users. No transition solution is made for API endpoints: End-user systems and Service Owner systems must maintain integration with both Altinn 2 and Altinn 3 during a transition period. Migrated messages will, after migration, be accessible via both Altinn 2 and Altinn 3 in their respective versions. Overall Process Flow for Migration of Historical Messages Main migration of historical message data: A one-time job over time. Migration of historical data and attachments - migration of message data. Migration of service configuration. Data synchronization period: Starts when step 1.1 has started and continues until Altinn 2 is shut down. Continuous migration of new messages. Continuous synchronization of status changes for migrated messages. Migration of delegations: Starts when step 1.2 is completed. A large \u0026ldquo;backlog\u0026rdquo; is expected when this starts, but in practice, it is the same job/component used in step 4. Delegation synchronization period: When steps 1 and 3 are completed, continues until Altinn 2 is shut down. Continuous synchronization of changes in delegations on service- and instance level. Making historical messages available in Altinn 3/Dialogporten/Arbeidsflate: This can theoretically happen after step 1 is completed, but for the best results, it should occur during period 4. Data from 2025 will be made available first, and then work backwards. Ongoing migration and availability of messages: Eventually, all new messages in Altinn 2 will almost immediately go through steps 2, 4, and 5 and thus be continuously available in the Dialogporten/Arbeidsflate. Responsibility Sharing The \u0026ldquo;Flytt av data\u0026rdquo; project is responsible for developing components for and executing steps 1 and 2, as well as steps 3 and 4 in collaboration with Team Authorization. They also take charge of step 6, while in close collaboration with the other parties.\nTeam Dialogporten/Arbeidsflate is responsible for deciding the when step 5 happens, while Team Melding og Formidling executes the actions required.\nTimeline / Dates As of 2025-10-09 the status is:\nIn TT02/Staging:\nSteps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 are completed. Step 5 is completed for messages newer than 2025-08-01; the rest will be done immediately. In PROD/Production:\nSteps 1, 2, 3, 4 are completed. Steps 5 and 6 are pending some performance optimization before starting 6 and 5 in parallel.

	"description": "Differences in Altinn Correspondence between Altinn 2 and Altinn 3",
	"content": "To simplify the transition from Altinn 2 to the Altinn 3 version of the Correspondence product, the data model and process flow of Altinn 2 Correspondence have been used as a basis, with some simplifications and improvements.\nHere are the main differences Altinn 3 Correspondence largely has the same data model as Altinn 2 to enable mapping and migration. The MessageSummary field has changed from supporting HTML formatting to supporting only plain text. ReplyOptions have been simplified to only be URL + descriptive text, as this is flexible enough to cover the needs that the separate types in Altinn 2 offered. MessageBody must now be in Markdown and HTML is no longer supported. Attachments are uploaded streamed and in a separate step before creating the Correspondence. Attachments can be shared across multiple messages to reduce data usage when mass sending the same attachment to many parties. The API facilitates mass sending of Correspondences using templates/keywords and recipient lists as well as the mentioned shared attachments. This makes it easy to send 1 request with a list of recipients and create up to 200 Correspondences as a result. Notification templates have been greatly simplified from Altinn 2; only a predefined set of templates representing \u0026ldquo;majority use\u0026rdquo; are supported, including one highly customizable one. If more advanced functionality is needed, it is encouraged to integrate directly with Altinn-Notifications The process is more asynchronous than before, but publishes Altinn-Events at important process steps so that both end-user systems fetching Correspondences for recipients and the senders of the Correspondences can follow the process without having to poll web services for status. All Correspondences are created in the Dialogporten and thus available for Arbeidsflate and other systems that integrate with the Dialogporten, without the sender of the Correspondences needing to perform specific actions. The authorization model is somewhat simplified: The right to be a sender can be set in the policy for the \u0026ldquo;Write\u0026rdquo; action and is no longer limited to only being the Service Owner. All recipient rights are simplified from Altinn 2\u0026rsquo;s granular \u0026ldquo;Read, Write, ArchiveRead, ArchiveDelete\u0026rdquo; to only \u0026ldquo;Read\u0026rdquo;. Archiving of Correspondences is not currently supported in the Altinn 3 implementation The closest you can get is using the SystemLabel \u0026ldquo;archive\u0026rdquo; in Dialogporten/Arbeidsflate, which can be used to filter in searches and GUI. Migrated correspondences from Altinn 2 that become archived will get the \u0026ldquo;archive\u0026rdquo; system label set. In addition the correspondence will have logged the unique \u0026ldquo;Archived\u0026rdquo; status in StatusHistory; not used by Altinn 3 Correspondences. "

This means that these documentation pages are currently in active development and may be temporarily incomplete. Setting up custom rules and alerts is currently not available to application owners, but we are aiming to support this during the autumn of 2024. To get started with monitoring in you app, see instrumentation and monitoring user guide.\nThis documentation contains information needed to support app developers and service owners in operating, monitoring/observing and instrumenting applications on the Altinn 3 platform.\nAltinn 3 uses the open and vendor-neutral OpenTelemetry specifications and protocols for instrumenting and shipping telemetry end-to-end. This enables us to bring a baseline monitoring that serves all applications, and enables service owners to make appropriate customizations as necessary, from custom enrichment and instrumentation to completely separate monitoring platforms.\nCore concepts Instrumentation is your software saying what it is doing.\nTelemetry is making that information available, whether by pull—something asking—or push—sending messages; “measurement at a distance”.\nMonitoring is receiving instrumentation and making it visible.\nAlerting is reacting to the monitored data, or patterns in the data.\nConfigurationAn overview of configuration options for monitoring in Altinn Apps.\nInstrumentationAn overview of how to instrument Altinn Apps, both automatic and manually.\nTelemetry registryAltinn App telemetry registry.

If you want to remove the instances, you can do so via the app’s APIs before unpublishing.\nHandling data after unpublishing:\nOnce the app is unpublished, you can still retrieve data, but you will need to use the Storage API after unpublishing. This is because the app’s own APIs will no longer be available.\nWhat can you do to make an app unavailable, instead of unpublishing? If you do not wish to unpublish the app, you can make it unavailable in several other ways:\nSwitch to an earlier version:\nIf the current version of the app has issues, you can choose to roll back to an earlier version that works better.\nDeactivate the app in the code:\nYou can remove access to the app in the code, making it unavailable in that way. This allows you to avoid completely unpublishing the app.\nChange access settings:\nYou can adjust the access settings so that users cannot start new instances of the application.\nImplement validation before you unpublish:\nBy adding validation in the code, you can decide when users should have access to the app. This can be useful if you want to give users a transition period before the app becomes completely unavailable in the environment.\nHow do I unpublish an app? Go to the guide for unpublishing apps.\n"

The various types define a particular activity, such as the creation of the dialog, a message being sent from the service owner, data being submitted by the party, a signature or payment made, a transmission being opened etc. For an exhaustive list of the various activity type, see the technical reference.\nThe service owner is responsible for populating the activity log, and should do so in relation to other changes made to the dialog. Activity log entries can refer to a particular transmission, eg. when it is opened and/or confirmed read.\nThe act of adding transmissions should not be accompanied with a activity log entry, as the transmission list is immutable and thus acts as a log itself. Frontends should aggregate the activity log, transmission list and seen log in order to build a full chronology of the dialogs history The activity log can be queried via API, and can be used when creating conditional notification orders, ie. when creating reminders.\nRead more\nTechical reference for the activity log entity How to create a dialog in Dialogporten Notification product documentation "

	"description": "Overview of changes introduced in v8 of the Altinn.App.* packages",
	"content": "Why version 8? V8 is a rewrite of the process engine in apps to support more advanced process flows and signing. For most existing apps the changes to the process engine are only visible in the App/config/process/process.bpmn file.\nWe also took the opportunity to move all interfaces from Altinn.App.Core.Interfaces to more descriptive namespaces under Altinn.App.Core.Internal. Some of these interfaces have been renamed. For example, the Altinn.App.Core.Interfaces.IData has been moved and renamed to Altinn.App.Core.Internal.Data.IDataClient.\nBreaking changes Changes in process.bpmn Altinn namespace changed Previously the name space for Altinn was http://altinn.no.

	"description": "Overview of changes introduced in v7 of the Altinn.App.* packages and application template.",
	"content": "Why version 7? V7 is an extensive upgrade to the Nuget core packages and the application template itself. This means that there is a lot of breaking changes that needs to be handled manually when upgrading the applications.\nThe goal behind this release:\nReduce the need for breaking changes moving forward Make it easier to extend the application with new features without having them in the core Make it easier for the community to contribute with new features by referencing and extending the core Make it easier to create reusable components Simplify application development and maintenance in general Speed up the development of the application Make development of Altinn 3 applications even closer to standard ASP.NET, making onboarding of new developers easier. While it\u0026rsquo;s a lot of changes, we think it\u0026rsquo;s better to do them now rather than later when we have a lot more applications to upgrade.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s changed? Read the following to get a high level overview over what\u0026rsquo;s changed\u0026rsquo;, then move on to the breaking changes page for instructions on how to upgrade.\nNuget packages are restructured In V6 we had:\nAltinn.App.Api Altinn.App.Common Altinn.App.PlatformServices In V7 we now have:\nAltinn.App.Api (same, but api related implementations from Common and PlatformServices is moved in here) Altinn.App.Core (previously Altinn.App.Common and Altinn.App.PlatformServices) Altinn.App.SourceGenerator (new, we will generate source so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to) This means that a lot of classes and interfaces have moved to new namespaces - don\u0026rsquo;t worry, nothing is deleted, they just have a new home. But this will affect your using statements.\nApp.cs and AppBase.cs is gone (and most other c# files in the template)! Previously the way to extend the application was by having a App.cs class inheriting from AppBase.cs and overriding a set of methods. This was fragile with regards to us introducing breaking changes. This has now been replaced with a set of small interfaces that needs to be implemented in custom classes and registered in the services collection in Program.cs.\nThe only c# file left in the template is now Program.cs. The logic folder and all subfolders and files is gone. The only reason to have other c# files is when you actually have custom implementations in some area. This also means that you can structure your application logic and namespaces the way you like. If you have custom implementations you should of course keep those. We will still generate a c# model in your model folder when you start working on the datamodel.\nProgram.cs is simplified Program.cs contained a lot of service registrations required for the application to work. We still need those registrations but most of them are now moved to the extension methods in Altinn.App.Api package and is added by calling AddAltinnAppControllersWithViews and AddAltinnAppServices. We have also added a method where you can place your custom code RegisterCustomAppServices making it easier to separate your code from ours when something changes in the future.\nDocumentation Previously our documentation reflected the current version only. Meaning when we introduced a new way of doing things, the old way was lost. For those still on older versions this was a problem since we the doc for the version they where on is gone.\nWe have now introduced a version tag on the pages where the implementation differs from major to major version, making it easy to se both the old ways and the new.\nBreaking changesOverview of breaking changes introduced in v7.0.0 of the App Nuget packages.\nWhat\u0026#39;s newOverview of changes introduced in version 7.\n"

This document aims to give an overview of the changes and how they may affect your app. As always, with a new major version, we recommend that you test your app thoroughly before deploying to production.\nMake sure to read through this page before you continue with the migration routine, and make the necessary changes throughout your app. Requires backend version 8.0.0 App frontend v4 requires at least version 8.0.0 of the Altinn.App.Core and Altinn.App.Api nuget packages. See the overview of changes in backend v8 for more information on how to upgrade.\nUsing layout sets is now required Layout sets is a way to support multiple forms in a single application. This entails a slightly different folder structure in the ui folder of your app, as well as a new layout-sets.json file. This used to be optional, but as of v4 it is required, even for apps with only a single data step. See the documentation on pages for more information.\nDefining a custom receipt is now done with a layout set This change was introduced in v4.0.0-rc3. It was not present in v4.0.0-rc1 or v4.0.0-rc2. In these previous versions, a custom receipt was not supported. A custom receipt view can now be created in the same way as all other form pages.\nTo create a custom receipt view, you create a new layout set. This layout set works exactly like all other page types. Within the layout set, you can create a layouts folder and define all the pages you want to include in the receipt view here (Yes, the receipt view supports multiple pages!). Inside the layout set, you must also create a Settings.json, where you can define the order of the pages in the receipt view.\nFor the app to understand that this layout set should be used as a receipt view, you must refer to the name of the layout set in layout-sets.json. Add a new layout set with id that refers to the name of your layout set, and add the key value \u0026quot;CustomReceipt\u0026quot; in the tasks array of the layout set. In addition, you can specify which data model should be available in the receipt view by adding the key dataType with the name of the data model you want to support.\nHere is a complete example where we have a layout set named custom-receipt that will be used as a receipt view:\nFolder structure |- App/ |- ui/ |- layout-sets.json |- custom-receipt/ |- layouts/ |- page1.json |- page2.json |- Settings.json Code App/ui/layout-sets.json { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout-sets.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sets\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;custom-receipt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;fields\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;CustomReceipt\u0026#34;] } ] } Code App/ui/custom-receipt/Settings.json { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;page1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;page2\u0026#34;] } } AddressComponent has been renamed to Address This change was introduced in v4.0.0-rc2. It was not present in v4.0.0-rc1, so the component was still called AddressComponent in that release. In the layout files, the AddressComponent component has been renamed to Address. Our upgrade tool will rename this for you automatically, but if you are migrating manually you will have to do this yourself.\nLanguage and text resource changes The language system that handles internal texts and app-specific text resources has been rewritten and improved. It should work mostly the same as before, but there are a few subtle changes that may affect your app:\nPreviously, when referring to a path in the data model which resulted in a null value, the full path would be shown instead for most components. However, in options from repeating groups, it would instead show an empty string in place of the null value. This has been changed so that the full path is shown in all cases instead. To alleviate the problem of referring to null values, a new defaultValue property has been added to the text resources that, if set, will be shown instead of the data model path. See the documentation on text resources for more information. Variables in text are now supported for items in nested repeating groups. Previously, only items in top-level repeating groups were supported in text resource variables. Using dataModel.default as the data source in text resources is no longer recommended. Instead, refer to the specific data type like this: dataModel.myDataModel. The frontend will now automatically retrieve the data model it needs when a text resource is displayed anywhere on the page, but dataModel.default will only work when rendering a form, as it will use the default data model for that form. We\u0026rsquo;re planning to add support for multiple data models in one form in the future, and at that point there will be no concept of a default data model. Most users will be prompted for party each time In the Altinn profile it was possible to change a setting to \u0026rsquo;not be prompted for party each time\u0026rsquo;. This setting was mistakenly never read by app-frontend, so we failed to respect it. The default setting in Altinn profile is to be prompted for a party each time, so in v4 we changed the default behaviour of app-frontend to match the setting in Altinn profile. This means that most users will be prompted for party each time they start an app, unless they have changed the setting in Altinn profile.\nThe setting can be found under Advanced settings in the Altinn profile: Altinn profile setting called \u0026#39;Do not ask what party I represent each time I start to fill in a new form\u0026#39; Unless the user changes this setting, they will be prompted with the following page each time they start a new instance: Page asking who the user wants to represent Tracks are no longer supported Showing and hiding pages using tracks (calculate page order) is no longer supported. This also means that the trigger calculatePageOrder no longer has any effect and should be removed from any components where it is used. Instead, you should use dynamic expressions on the hidden property of a layout page to determine whether pages should be visible or hidden.\nTo opt-in for an automatic AI-generated Pull Request to help you migrate from the old tracks feature, see the Opt-in to Altinn AI for tracks migration.\nSee the documentation on dynamic expressions for more information.\nData model schema validation works for more data models The form data gets validated against the data model schema to show validation messages to the user filling out the form. There was a bug in v3 that caused this validation to not happen at all for certain data model structures. This has been now been fixed, but is a breaking change since if you previously did not get any schema validation errors, you may suddenly see them now. If this was the case you should test your app to make sure validation works as expected.\nSupport for number, integer and boolean and other data types One of the new features is full support for non-string data types in the data model. This means that you can now have data model fields of type number, boolean, and bind them to components. For example, if you bind a Checkboxes component to a boolean field, and provide an options list with the strings \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;false\u0026quot;, the frontend will convert the strings to booleans.\nIf you bind an Input component to a number field, the frontend will convert the string to a number while the user is typing. For the best possible user experience, set up number formatting on the Input component.\nNote: If you have set up a RuleHandler.js file in your app, you may need to update it to handle the new data types. In cases where the RuleConfiguration.json file specified a path that pointed to a number or boolean field, the RuleHandler.js file would previously receive a string value. This is no longer the case, and code in RuleHandler.js should be updated accordingly.\nNote: In addition to all of this, the app frontend now properly supports objects and null values. This should not affect most apps, but it might be of interest when writing data processor code on the backend. If your data model initializes an object, even if empty, the app-frontend will now preserve that object in later communication with the backend. Previously, app-frontend would remove empty objects from the data model, leading to data processors having to re-initialize the object on the backend every time. Please note that app-frontend does not initialize objects for you the first time, so you still need to do that in your data model or data processor code.\nThe saveWhileTyping property now only accepts numbers The saveWhileTyping property on the Input component and other Input-like components used to accept a boolean value for turning off saving while typing. In v4, saving while typing is always enabled, but it is still possible to delay saving by setting saveWhileTyping to a number larger than 400 (our default debounce time in milliseconds).\nWhen delaying saving, we may still save the data to the backend before that time, for example when the user navigates away from the field and starts typing in a new field (with a lower, or default saveWhileTyping value).\nIf your app relied on disabling saveWhileTyping to ensure your custom data processor was not called too often (as we\u0026rsquo;ve often seen done when a change in one field triggers an API call), you should consider making the expensive action in your data processor a custom action instead, via adding a CustomButton component nearby the field. This way the user controls when the action is triggered, not our automatic saving functionality.\nComponents will not show up if they contain configuration errors Because of the support for other data types, we now have to be more strict about the configuration of components, as the frontend has to make sure it is able to look up the data model value expected for a component in order to save data into it. Previously the app-frontend would assume data model bindings were correct, and in combination with the backend, invalid bindings would result in data being lost.\nTo be on the safer side, components will now be replaced with an error message if they contain configuration errors, including invalid data model bindings. These error messages will only appear in development mode (i.e. in a test environment, or when running locally). In production, it will appear as if invalid components are hidden.\nYou should thoroughly test your app to make sure that components display correctly and that all data model bindings are correct. Testing this should include opening repeating groups and triggering conditions to unhide hidden components.\nIf you get an error message for an invalid binding you disagree with, please check that the data model *.schema.json file is up-to-date with the latest changes to the data model. Do not hesitate to contact us if you need help with this.\nError message shown when a component has an invalid data model binding The group component has been split into multiple components The different methods of configuring the Group component have been split into separate components.\nVis/skjul innhold Group The group component is now only used to group components together and provide them with an accessible top level title and description as well as optionally visually grouping the items together by using \u0026quot;groupingIndicator\u0026quot;. After the split, invalid configurations for a Group will be shown as an error message. Consider if you want to use one of the other group components instead. A commonly confused configuration is using \u0026quot;dataModelBindings\u0026quot; on a Group component, which is not supported. The group itself does not bind to data, only its children may. Vis/skjul innhold Group as panel Severity indicators (the icons and meaning bearing colors) have been removed, the default color (blue) is used. This is done since the display of important information should be handled with Alert and its meaning bearing colors and icons. showGroupingIndicator has changed name to \u0026quot;groupingIndicator\u0026quot;, and has been changed from a boolean to an enum of \u0026quot;panel\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;indented\u0026quot;. Where \u0026quot;indented\u0026quot; behaves like the old \u0026quot;showGroupingIndicator\u0026quot;: true Using the panel styling is now achieved by setting \u0026quot;groupingIndicator\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;panel\u0026quot;. Example of old to new config:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My title\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My description\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;panel\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;variant\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;info\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;showIcon\u0026#34;: false }, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;some-child-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;some-other-child-id\u0026#34;] } \u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My title\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My description\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;groupingIndicator\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;panel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;some-child-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;some-other-child-id\u0026#34;] } Vis/skjul innhold Repeating group Repeating group is no longer configured with \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Group\u0026quot; and a maxCount greater than 1, but with its own type; \u0026quot;RepeatingGroup\u0026quot; \u0026quot;maxCount\u0026quot; is no longer required to create a repeating group, but is still able to be used to restrict the maximum number of addable rows. edit.filter is no longer supported, but the same functionality (or better) can be achieved by using the existing hiddenRow property with expressions. Example of old to new config:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 99, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My title\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Datamodel.MyGroup\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;some-child-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;some-other-child-id\u0026#34;] } \u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;RepeatingGroup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My title\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Datamodel.MyGroup\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;some-child-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;some-other-child-id\u0026#34;] } Vis/skjul innhold Likert group The Likert component is no longer configured using a \u0026quot;Group\u0026quot; component with \u0026quot;edit\u0026quot;: {\u0026quot;mode\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;likert\u0026quot;} and a separate \u0026quot;Likert\u0026quot; component as a child of the group that handles the possible answers to the questions. It is now configured with a single component using \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Likert\u0026quot; The \u0026quot;filter\u0026quot; property have been moved out of the \u0026quot;edit\u0026quot; property, as the edit property has been removed. This is done because the filter property was the only one that was valid for the likert component, and the likert does not have an edit functionality. New textResourceBindings has been added to control the texts available on the likert questions. \u0026quot;questions\u0026quot; is used for the question labels themselves. \u0026quot;questionDescriptions\u0026quot; is used for the description of the questions, displayed beneath each question. \u0026quot;questionHelpTexts\u0026quot; is used for the help text of the questions, displayed after each question. Example of old to new config:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 99, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My title\u0026#34;, }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Questions\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;my-likert-id\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;edit\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;likert\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;filter\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;start\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;stop\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; } ], } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-likert-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Likert\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dynamic-text-resource-binding-title\u0026#34;, }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Questions.Answer\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34; } \u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-likert-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Likert\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My title\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;questions\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dynamic-text-resource-binding-title\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;questions\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Questions\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;answer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Questions.Answer\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;filter\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;start\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;stop\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; } ] } Vis/skjul innhold Repeating group reference This feature has been removed in favour of code maintenance because it is not used anywhere. Title and description changes for Groups The title attribute in textResourceBindings for the RepeatingGroup component previously only applied to the title shown above each row in the summary view of the repeating group. This attribute is now only used as the title for the repeating group in the form view. This means that the title will now be shown above the repeating group in the form view if it has been set.\nThe summaryTitle attribute in textResourceBindings for the RepeatingGroup component will override the title, and is used for displaying the title above each row in the summary view of the repeating group.\nThe body attribute in textResourceBindings for the Group component and RepeatingGroup component is now called description in order to be more consistent with the rest of the components.\nValidation triggers have been replaced The concept of triggering validations has been removed in favor of keeping the validations in sync with the data model. Instead of controlling when validations are triggered, you now control when validations are displayed to the user. This functions more or less the same as before, but the configuration has been changed.\nThis change also has the advantage that the need for *FIXED* validations no longer exists, as a IFormDataValidator in your custom backend code can now control when it should run, and when it runs all its validation messages are treated as one group. This means that if you have a validation that checks the value of another field, or multiple fields at once, the validation message will disappear in frontend when the validation message is no longer added to the list of validation messages in the backend - even if another component than the validation message target was the one that changed.\nVis/skjul innhold Validation on page navigation The old configuration for triggering validation on page change was the following:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nav-buttons1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationButtons\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;validatePage\u0026#34;] } Where the trigger could be one of: validatePage | validateAllPages | validateCurrentAndPreviousPages.\nTo achieve the same result in v4, you instead use the new validateOnNext property:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nav-buttons1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationButtons\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;validateOnNext\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;page\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;current\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;show\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;All\u0026#34;] } } Where page can be one of: current | all | currentAndPrevious. And show contains a set of validation types to check; this can be one or more of:\nSchema Component Expression CustomBackend Required AllExceptRequired All Note that there is also a new validateOnPrevious property, which works the same way as validateOnNext. Equivalently, for the NavigationBar component, there is a new validateOnForward and validateOnBackward property.\nVis/skjul innhold Validation when saving repeating group row The old configuration for triggering validation when saving a repeating group row was the following:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;repeating-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [...], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 99, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;validateRow\u0026#34;], ... } To achieve the same result in v4, you instead use the new validateOnSaveRow property:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;repeating-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [...], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 99, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;validateOnSaveRow\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;All\u0026#34;], ... } Where validateOnSaveRow contains a set of validation types to check; this can be one or more of:\nSchema Component Expression CustomBackend Required AllExceptRequired All Vis/skjul innhold Single field validation The old configuration for single field validation was the following:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-input-field\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;validation\u0026#34;] }, To achieve the same result in v4, you instead use the new showValidations property:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-input-field\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;showValidations\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;AllExceptRequired\u0026#34;] }, Where showValidations contains a set of validation types to check; this can be one or more of:\nSchema Component Expression CustomBackend Required AllExceptRequired All This causes validations to become visible immediately when they occur. Because of this, you may want to make sure that any custom validation code you have written does not produce a validation error when the field is empty, as this will cause the validation to be shown immediately when the user enters the page. If leaving the field empty is invalid, please mark the field as required instead of validating that with custom code.\nNote: \u0026quot;showValidations\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;AllExceptRequired\u0026quot;] is the default value if the property is not set. Meaning that all validations except for Required valdiations will be shown immediately. This also includes any custom validations implemented in the backend which previously needed \u0026quot;triggers\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;validation\u0026quot;] to be set on the component. To avoid showing certain types of validations immediately, you can override the showValidations property on the component.\nAttachmentList config changes The AttachmentList component has undergone updates in v4 to address two key issues:\n1. Enhanced Attachment Display Previously, the AttachmentList could only show either PDFs or other attachments. In version 4, it has been changed to show both PDFs and other attachments simultaneously.\nChanges to configurations:\nThe includePDF property has been removed. It was previously used to display generated PDFs, but when set to true, it excluded all other attachments. Now the AttachmentList can display both PDFs and other attachments by using one of the following configurations:\n\u0026quot;dataTypeIds\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;include-all\u0026quot;] This is a new property and will display all data types including PDFs. \u0026quot;dataTypeIds\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;fileUpload-changename\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ref-data-as-pdf\u0026quot;] This will display both PDFs and other attachments that are specified, in this case the data type fileUpload-changename. 2. Displaying Attachments from other process tasks Previously, the AttachmentList was limited to displaying attachments solely from the current process task, which was not optimal. This limitation was particularly noticeable when the component was used in the receipt page, which is displayed only after the last process task.\nChanges to configurations:\nNow, by default, the AttachmentList will display attachments from other process tasks as well. If dataTypeIds is undefined or an empty array, it will show all attachments (excluding PDFs) from different process tasks. Alternatively, configuring dataTypeIds as [\u0026quot;current-task\u0026quot;] will yield the same behavior but for the current task only.\n"

	"content": "Endre eksisterende datamodell Eksisterende datamodell (XSD) kan lastes opp i verktøyet og redigeres. Alle XSD attributter vil følge med fra den opprinnelige XSD\u0026rsquo;en, selv om disse ikke kan redigeres i verktøyet.\nDersom det kun er behov for små endringer på datamodellen, og det kun er behov for endringer ifm Altinn 2, anbefales det allikevel at man gjør disse endringene manuelt direkte på XSD\u0026rsquo;en. Dette kan gjøres med forskjellige verktøy, noen eksempler følger:\nXML Spy Visual Studio Code med f.eks. XML extension Opprette ny datamodell for Altinn 2 Det er mulig å lage en ny datamodell fra bunnen av til Altinn 2 i Altinn Studio Datamodellering. Dette gjøres ved å velge Lag ny i verktøyet. Det blir da opprettet en mal for modellen med et enkelt felt. Pass på å legge til følgende på rot i {model}.schema.json-filen for modellen, da dette må til for at TUL skal kjenne igjen modellen som en SERES-modell.\n\u0026#34;@xsdRootElement\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;melding\u0026#34;, For mer informasjon om utvikling av modell fra bunn av i ASD, se denne guiden.\nDersom man gjør endringer på datamodell via Altinn Studio Datamodellering anbefales det at alle manuelle endringer som gjøres i tillegg, gjøres på {model}.schema.json-filen . Denne filen opprettes/genereres automatisk når man lager en ny datamodell, eller laster/henter opp XSD. Dette er for å slippe å måtte gjøre de samme manuelle endringene på XSD hver gang man gjør endringer på modellen.\nDersom man kun gjør endringer direkte på XSD utenfor ASD, vil ikke denne {model}.schema.json-filen bli generert og man kan jobbe direkte på XSD.\ndataFormatId og dataFormatVersion Disse verdiene vil tas med fra den opprinnelige datamodellen dersom man laster den opp i Altinn Studio Datamodellering. De kan derimot ikke redigeres i ASD. Ved behov for å redigere disse for eksisterende modeller, gjøres dette manuelt direkte i \u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.schema.json-filen som genereres når XSD lastes opp. Dette er for å sikre at disse verdiene følger meg også om man gjør endringer på modellen i ASD ved senere tidspunkt.\nEksempel på dataFormatId/Version Ved behov for å opprette nye datamodeller (som ikke baserer seg på en eksisterende modell med disse verdiene satt) for Altinn 2 må disse verdiene settes manuelt.\ndataFormatId kan være en string med maks 30 tegn. Konvensjonen på SERES XSD\u0026rsquo;er har vært et tall med 4 siffer, men dette feltet kan også inneholde andre tegn. dataFormatVersion må være et heltall for å fungere med Altinn 2. Om man oppretter en ny datamodell anbefaler vi å f.eks. begynne på 1, og øke ved behov. XSD attributter Altinn Studio Datamodellering støtter i utgangspunktet ikke redigering av XSD attributter. Ved opplasting av eksisterende XSD vil alle eksisterende XSD-attributter beholdes og skrives tilbake når ny XSD genereres etter endringer.\nRedigere XSD attributter Disse kan redigeres manuelt i \u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.schema.json-filen som genereres når man lager en ny modell eller laster opp XSD i verktøyet. De kan finnes på det feltet de hører til, under @xsdAttribute-tagen.\nLegge til nye XSD attributter Dette gjøres også manuelt i \u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.schema.json-filen som genereres når man lager en ny modell eller laster opp XSD i verktøyet.

Finn frem til noden der anyAttribute skal settes, og legg til følgende på noden:\n\u0026#34;@xsdAnyAttribute\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Namespace\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;##any\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ProcessContent\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;None\u0026#34; }, Attributter på xsd:schema-noden Dette kan settes/redigeres manuelt i \u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.schema.json-filen som genereres når man lager en ny modell eller laster opp XSD i verktøyet. Det er ikke nødvendig å legge dette til manuelt om man har lastet opp en XSD i verktøyet, kun om man starter med tom modell i verktøyet. Disse settes på roten av \u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.schema.json-filen, ved å legge til:\n\u0026#34;@xsdSchemaAttributes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;AttributeFormDefault\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Unqualified\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ElementFormDefault\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Qualified\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;BlockDefault\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;None\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;FinalDefault\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;None\u0026#34; }, XSD Namespaces Namespaces på xsd:schema-noden Dette kan settes/redigeres manuelt i \u0026lt;model\u0026gt;.schema.json-filen som genereres når man lager en ny modell eller laster opp XSD i verktøyet.

	"description": "In Altinn Studio designer, the application developer can define the policy for the application created",
	"content": "The application developer defines the authorization rules for an application in an XACML policy file placed in the app repository. The XACML Policy contains one or more rules which determine who can perform different actions on different resources. You can edit the XACML file in a text editor of your choice.\nRules from the application template When you create an app in Altinn studio, it is based on the current asp.net template and will include an autogenerated XACML policy file.\nThe application developer can change the authorization rules in policy.xml, which lies in App/config/authorization in the application repository. You can find details about configuring the policy file below. You can also find a good amount of example rules here.\nPlease note that changes to the policy file are at your own risk and that it is always recommended to delegate read permissions to entities with writing permissions. Resource Attributes The resource attributes of rules describe which application or part of the rules apply.\nAttribute Description urn:altinn:org The org part of the resource attribute defines which org that owns the app. urn:altinn:app The app part that identifies the app itself. urn:altinn:task The task part of the resource makes it possible to have separate rules for the different tasks. urn:altinn:event The event part of the resource makes it possible to have separate rules for reading events.

There are built in scopes for users and service owners:\naltinn:instances.read and altinn:instances.write for users (and systemusers) altinn:serviceowner/instances.read and altinn:serviceowner/instances.write for service owners. These scopes can also be customized per app for both users and service owners.

These guidelines explain what the application owner must consider before authorization rules are set for an application\nRule libraryLibrary of authorization rules that can be used in an app. Remember to replace tags ([RULE_ID]) with your own ID. [ORG] and [APP] can will be replaced later, so they can remain in the file if you use Local test from january 2023 or newer.\n"

	"description": "How unknown options are automatically removed from the data model",
	"content": "Some options for components may be dynamic. Either directly via dynamic options, options derived from a changing data model, or by static options where some values may be filtered out.\nWhen the options are dynamic, the data model may contain values that are no longer valid. This can happen if the user (or prefill) has selected an option that is no longer available. In such cases, to prevent the data model from containing invalid values, unknown options are automatically removed.\nHow it works When the form is loaded, the options for all components are fetched and compared to their values in the data model. Even if a component is not visible (i.e. on a page that is not currently shown, not when it\u0026rsquo;s actively hidden using the hidden property), the app-frontend will still check the options for that component and remove any values that are not in the options list.\nThis has some implications that you should be aware of:\nIf you configure multiple components pointing to the same field in the data model, the options for all those components should be the same. If they are not, the field in the data model will be adjusted to include only the options that are valid for all components. If the component is not marked as required, the user can submit the form even if the value is removed from the data model. If you want to ensure that the user selects a valid option, you should mark the component as required. When it doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen The automatic cleanup of unknown options currently only happens when the form is loaded via the app-frontend, i.e. when the user opens the form in a browser. Automatic cleanup does not happen when the component is marked as hidden. For this reason you can also have multiple components pointing to the same field in the data model, where some are hidden and some are visible. In such cases, only the visible components will have their options checked and cleaned up. This is also the case if a component is hidden due to being on a hidden page, or inside another hidden component. The term \u0026lsquo;hidden\u0026rsquo; in this sense refers to dynamic expressions used to hide components, not which components are currently visible on the page. Removal of unknown values does not happen for the FileUploadWithTag component. Removal of unknown values does not happen for components configured with renderAsSummary set to true. "

They should not have a direct connection to the store, and should not know anything about the store.\nSagas All logic used in a saga should be an exported function in the utils-folder. This is decided since we need to split up the logic from the fetching of data, so we have a more testable codebase. The saga only fetches data from the state, and sends the appropriate data to utils-functions.\nFolder Structure This is the best practice for folder structure in applications. Note that this is not necessarily how the folder structure is for all the apps, but when creating anything new, or cleaning up, this is how it should look.\n- src / - config / - config.json - exportedConfig.js - features / # routes,pages,features - [featureName] / - components / - containers / - resources / - featureSpecificData / - delete / - deleteFeatureSpecificDataActions.ts - deleteFeatureSpecificDataSagas.ts - fetch / - ... - upload / - ... - featureSpecificDataActions.ts - featureSpecificDataActionTypes.ts - featureSpecificDataReducers.ts - featureSpecificDataSagas.ts - selectors / - getSomeResourceSelector.ts - reducers / - featureNameReducer.ts - utils / # Feature specific utils - formFiller / # Example feature - components / - containers / - resources - attachments / # FileUpload example - delete / - deleteAttachmentsActions.ts - deleteAttachmentsSagas.ts - fetch / - fetchAttachmentsActions.ts - ... - upload / - ... - attachmentsActions.ts - attachmentsActionTypes.ts - attachmentsReducers.ts - attachmentsSagas.ts - selectors / - getSomeResouceSelector.ts - reducers / - formfillerReducer.ts - utils / - reducers / - index.ts - shared / - components / # Shared components - resources / # Shared resources - [resourceName] / - [action] / - \u0026lt;action\u0026gt;\u0026lt;resourceName\u0026gt;Actions.ts - \u0026lt;action\u0026gt;\u0026lt;resourceName\u0026gt;Sagas.ts - \u0026lt;resourceName\u0026gt;Actions.ts - \u0026lt;resourceName\u0026gt;ActionTypes.ts - \u0026lt;resourceName\u0026gt;Reducer.ts - \u0026lt;resourceName\u0026gt;Sagas.ts - language / # example resource - fetch / - fetchLanguageActions.ts - fetchLanguageSagas.ts - someAction / - someActionOnLanguageActions.ts - someActionOnLanguageSagas.ts - languageActions.ts - languageActionTypes.ts - languageReducer.ts - languageSagas.ts - types / - utils / - store - types - utils "

This API work primarily with the blob while keeping the metadata document updated.\nbasePath\n{org}/{appname}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid}/data Get data Endpoint for downloading the data blob.\nGET basePath/{dataGuid} Accept: application/{xml/json} The response will depend on the type of blob. There are currently 2 primary types: form data based on a model and attachments. An Accept header in a request will be considered only when the requested data element is connected to a data model. The header is then used to pick a serializer for the data.\nResponse with form data A response with form data will either be a json or xml serialized version of the data model depending on the Accept header in the request. The value application/xml will result in an XML document and the value application/json will result inn a JSON document.\nResponse with attachment A response with a file attachment will be a file stream. Content-Type will be the same as the original value given when the file was uploaded. The same is true for the file name.\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=cute_cat.png; filename*=UTF-8\u0026#39;\u0026#39;cute_cat.png Content-Length: 16994 Content-Type: image/png Upload data Endpoint for uploading a new data element on a specific instance.\nPOST basePath?dataType={data type name} The dataType parameter is required and should reference one of the data types defined on the application. Data types with an appLogic property are linked to a form and will have data validation and calculation rules associated with them. Data types without an appLogic property will be handled as an attachment and streamed directly to storage.\nRequest Content-Type is handled a little differently between the two cases:\nIf a request is uploading form data, the Content-Type is used by Altinn to deserialize the request into a strongly typed object. A request must either be application/json or application/xml. No other Content-Types are supported. Content-Type is not validated against allowed Content-Types on the data type. If a request is uploading an attachment, the validation of Content-Type will depend on the rules of the data type. If the data type has no Content-Type requirements, there will be no validation and the request can contain any Content-Type. If the data type has Content-Type requirements, there is a new set of checks. The request Content-Type must either be application/octet-stream or match the MIME type of the file being uploaded. Altinn will perform a mapping from file extension to MIME type before comparing with Content-Type. As an example we can see that .xml will map to text/xml and not application/xml.

	"description": "Generated runtime by custom C# code",
	"content": "In an Altinn 3 app you can also have dynamic code lists that are generated runtime. This makes it possible to have dynamic lists that are filtered or looked up in external sources. Dynamic code lists can either be public (accessible to all, without authentication), or secured and limited to those with read access to the instance.\nFor public code lists, implement the IAppOptionsProvider interface, while for secured code lists, implement the IInstanceAppOptionsProvider. The approach is the same for both, and the model returned is the same. The implementation is kept separate to avoid exposing values that should be secured.\nPublic code lists Below you find an example of how to implement a public code list provider.\nusing Altinn.App.Common.Models; using Altinn.App.PlatformServices.Options; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; namespace Altinn.App.Core { public class CountryAppOptionsProvider : IAppOptionsProvider { public string Id { get; set; } = \u0026#34;countries\u0026#34;; public Task\u0026lt;AppOptions\u0026gt; GetAppOptionsAsync(string language, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; keyValuePairs) { var options = new AppOptions { Options = new List\u0026lt;AppOption\u0026gt; { new AppOption { Label = \u0026#34;Norway\u0026#34;, Value = \u0026#34;47\u0026#34; }, new AppOption { Label = \u0026#34;Sweden\u0026#34;, Value = \u0026#34;46\u0026#34; } } }; return Task.FromResult(options); } } } For your implementation to work up you need to add the following line in your Program.cs:\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;IAppOptionsProvider, CountryAppOptionsProvider\u0026gt;(); The result of this implementation will be available at the endpoint {org}/{app}/api/options/countries. The identifier can be used in components, so to use the code list in a Dropdown component you can set optionsId as in the following example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Some title\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.field\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;countries\u0026#34; } Secured code lists If you need to generate sensitive code lists, you can implement the IInstanceAppOptionsProvider interface. This ensures that the user access is validated based on read rights defined in the authorization policy specified in the policy.xml file. Below you\u0026rsquo;ll find an example of how to implement a secured options provider.\nusing System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Common.Models; using Altinn.App.PlatformServices.Models; namespace Altinn.App.Core { public class ChildrenAppOptionsProvider : IInstanceAppOptionsProvider { public string Id { get; set; } = \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;; public Task\u0026lt;AppOptions\u0026gt; GetInstanceAppOptionsAsync(InstanceIdentifier instanceIdentifier, string language, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; keyValuePairs) { // ... // Some custom code to get the list of children from the instance owner // ... var options = new AppOptions { Options = new List\u0026lt;AppOption\u0026gt; { new AppOption { Label = \u0026#34;Ole\u0026#34;, Value = \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; }, new AppOption { Label = \u0026#34;Dole\u0026#34;, Value = \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; }, new AppOption { Label = \u0026#34;Doffen\u0026#34;, Value = \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; } } }; return Task.FromResult(options); } } } For your implementation to work you need to add the following line in your Program.cs:\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;IInstanceAppOptionsProvider, ChildrenAppOptionsProvider\u0026gt;(); The result of this implementation will be available at the endpoint {org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerId}/{instanceGUID}/options/children. The identifier can be used in components, so to use the code list in a Dropdown component you can set optionsId as in the following example. It is also important to set the secure property to true to indicate that this is a secured code list.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Some title\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.field\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;secure\u0026#34;: true } Query parameters The options endpoint you create supports query parameters. The language parameter is sent automatically, and other parameters can be sent from the component configuration. These can be read from the keyValuePairs parameter in the implementation. This can be useful to filter the code list based on data in the data model, or in other ways vary the code list based on context.\nAs an example, consider a form with two Dropdown components that are linked together. The first lets the user choose a county, and the second lets the user choose a municipality. The municipalities shown in the second component should be filtered based on the county selected in the first component. This can be solved by sending the county as a query parameter to the code list for municipalities (and then filter the list based on this parameter in your implementation).\nBased on expressions Query parameters based on expressions are available from app-frontend version 4.9.0 or higher. If your app is using the rolling release of major version 4, this is already available. You can add both static and dynamic parameters by setting up queryParameters on the component:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Some title\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.field\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;countries\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;queryParameters\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;country\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;norway\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;orgnumber\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;some.orgnumber\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;adult\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;greaterThanEq\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;some.age\u0026#34;], 18] } } In the example above the parameter country=norway will always be added to the request (this is entirely static and will not change). The parameter orgnumber={nr} will be added, where {nr} is the value of the field some.orgnumber in the data model. The parameter adult={bool} will be added, where {bool} will be either true or false based on whether the value of the field some.age is greater than or equal to 18.\nMore examples of expressions can be found in the dynamics documentation, and the full list of available functions can be found in the expression reference overview.\nBased on the data model This approach is discouraged. From app-frontend version 4.9.0, it is possible to use the queryParameters property instead. As explained above, queryParameters enables you to include both static and dynamic query parameters through expressions, offering greater flexibility compared to mapping.\nAt some point, the mapping property will be removed, but when that happens tools will be provided to migrate existing configurations to use queryParameters instead.\nYou can add dynamic parameters by setting the mapping property on the component:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-dropdown-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NyGarantiLoyvetype\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;soknad.nyGaranti.loyvetype\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;loyvetyper\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mapping\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;soknad.transportorOrgnummer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;orgnummer\u0026#34; } } In the example above, the query parameter orgnummer={nr}, where {nr} is the value of soknad.transportorOrgnummer will be set. If an option is setup with mapping and the given data field changes app-frontend will refetch the option. This can be used to dynamically decide which choices are available based on information given by the end user.\nPassing query parameters from repeating groups is also supported by adding an index indicator for the relevant indexes. Example for a group:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Select city\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group.City\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;cities\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mapping\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Group[{0}].Country\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;country\u0026#34; } } For nested groups follows the same pattern but with an additional index indicator for the nested group:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown-nested-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Select city\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group.SubGroup.City\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;cities\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mapping\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Group[{0}].SubGroup[{1}].Country\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;country\u0026#34; } } For a complete example of how this is setup see our demo app.\nThings to consider The GetAppOptionsAsync method accepts a language code through the language parameter. Language codes follow either the ISO 639-1 standard or the W3C IANA Language Subtag Registry. While ISO 639-1 may have conflicting usages for certain codes, the W3C IANA registry builds on ISO 639-1 and ensures the uniqueness of its codes. An app can have many implementations of these interfaces, one for each option list. The correct implementation is found by looking at the code list identifier that is requested, and comparing it to the Id property in the implementation. This is also the identifier used in the optionsId property in the component configuration. Therefore, the Id property in the implementation must be unique per app. It may be tempting to implement a dynamic option list that fetches data from the data model and produces the option list based on this. This is not recommended, as the app frontend only fetches the option list once for each unique set of query parameters. This means that the user interface showing the option list will not update in line with changes in the data model. An alternative is to use the functionality for dynamic code lists based on the data model, in some cases together with corresponding code in DataProcessor. Another alternative may be to use query parameters, as described above. If you use query parameters, it may be wise to consider how many unique combinations of parameters will typically be used in the app. If there are many, consider using a different approach such as fetching all data and filtering valid values in the frontend using optionFilter. Many different combinations of query parameters can lead to the app having to do a lot of unnecessary work to fetch new option lists every time the user makes a change in the form. "

	"content": "This page is a work-in-progress. Because we do not have details on how potential errors should be shown to the users, this is only a general overview currently. More details will be added once we have a functional understanding of how users should experience errors. React components Error boundaries Error boundaries are React\u0026rsquo;s official way of handling errors that occur in a component. This functionality is available from React 16. Using this allows a component to fail without unmounting the whole application, and allows us to control how the user is exposed to unexpected errors.\nSee the official React documentation or this official blog post for more information about error boundaries and how to implement them.\nWe need a generic error boundary component that can be configured and reused for all of the sub-applications. Each sub-application should be wrapped in this error boundary component. This will allow the main applications (service-development and dashboard) to keep functioning even though any sub-applications throw an error.\nIn addition we should have a generic \u0026ldquo;something went wrong\u0026rdquo; error boundary for the main applications.\nWithin the sub-applications, it may be beneficial to implement error boundaries around key components. This will typically be relevant for components that act as containers for other components. An example could be the preview-component in the UI-editor, which shows the working surface of the forms designer.\nEvent handlers Error boundaries do not catch errors that occur within event handlers, as mentioned in the official React documentation. Thus, any direct API calls from within an event handler in a React component should be wrapped in a try/catch block.\nOptional props Any use of props that have been defined as optional should be done together with a null/undefined-check, to make sure that the prop is actually available.\nRedux Actions All actions should have sibling actions for success and error. See naming conventions for actions. The success action is triggered when everything is ok, while the error action is triggered if something goes wrong.\nSagas If a saga needs to make an API call (or uses logic/utils that make API calls), this should be wrapped in a try/catch block. If an error occurs, this should be logged and the corresponding error action should be triggered. If no error occurs then the corresponding success action should be triggered. See here for more information on actions and sagas.\nReducers If an error handling action is triggered, the reducer should update the corresponding error object in the state to reflect that an error has occured.\nLogging errors We need to decide if all errors should be logged on the server or not. If all front-end errors should be logged on the server, we need to create an API we can call from the front-end to to the logging. All errors that are caught should be logged to the console using console.error.\n"

	"title": "Exception handling",
	"tags": ["development", "error-handling", "exception-handling"],
	"description": "Guidelines for exception handling in backend logic.",
	"content": "Exception Handling Exception handling is the act of catching an exception with the intention of handling the situation so that normal execution flow can continue. It should not be used as any part of an expected execution flow. It should also be avoided if the situation continue to be unrecoverable.\n.Net core provides a default middleware UseExceptionHandler that will catch exceptions and log them. You can read more about this here. This is the preferred mechanism when it comes to dealing with errors the application logic is unable to handle elegantly on its own. The middleware should be configured to generate a response that is appropriate for the running environment.\nExceptions that can be handled by the application logic should be handled as soon and as specific as possible. The following example is found in the platform Storage application. More specifically the DataController.GetDataElementAsync method.\nActionResult errorMessage; try { DataElement dataElement = await _dataRepository.Read(instanceGuid, dataGuid); return (dataElement, null); } catch (DocumentClientException dce) { if (dce.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.NotFound) { errorMessage = NotFound($\u0026#34;Unable to find any data element with id: {dataGuid}.\u0026#34;); } else { throw; } } In this example the try..catch is interested only in the DocumentClientException, and on top of that only when the StatusCode is NotFound. All other exceptions and exception reasons are ignored and will end up in the .Net Core middleware.\nAPI Response Exceptions that are handled by application logic can result in almost any response. The outcome will depend on the type of exception and how it is handled:\n200 - Ok - The original request is considered successfully processed. 400 - BadRequest - The exception was caused by a faulty request. In this case it is preferred that the application logic does active validation instead of needing to deal with an exception. 401 - Unauthorized - Similar to BadRequest, but logic is associated with authentication. 403 - Forbidden - Similar to BadRequest, but logic is associated with authorization. 404 - NotFound - The requested resource does not exist. By limiting the usage of status codes, we can ease the handling of different status codes at client side. Application logic should (ideally) never produce a 500 response. Exceptions that are not handled by application logic, but the default middleware will always result in a response with status code 500.\nMiddleware configuration Handling of unrecoverable errors should be done by the built in middleware mentioned previously. The configuration should be different between production environments and other environments. In development and staging environments the middleware should allow detailed exception information to be exposed by the API.\nConfiguration of the middleware is done in the Startup.Configure method. This is an example from the platform Storage application:\nif (env.IsDevelopment() || env.IsStaging()) { app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage(); } else { app.UseExceptionHandler(\u0026#34;/storage/api/v1/error\u0026#34;); } This configuration requires an ErrorController that can handle the server side redirect performed by the middleware. The following code sample is a stipped version of the ErrorController in the platform Storage application:\n[ApiController] [ApiExplorerSettings(IgnoreApi = true)] [AllowAnonymous] [Route(\u0026#34;storage/api/v1\u0026#34;)] public class ErrorController : ControllerBase { [Route(\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;)] public IActionResult Error() =\u0026gt; Problem(); } "

The parameter doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any code associated with it. process.ended (datetime)\nFilter instances based on ended date. instanceOwner.partyId (int)\nFilter instances based on the instance owner party id. lastChanged (datetime)\nFilter instances based on the last time they where worked on. created (datetime)\nFilter instances based on when they where initially created. visibleAfter (datetime)\nFilter instances based on when they became visible. dueBefore (datetime)\nFilter instances based on their due date. excludeConfirmedBy (string)\nExclude instances already confirmed by a specific stakeholder. Usually the short name of an application owner. status.isArchived (bool) Filter instances based on whether they are archived. size (int) The page size returned mainVersionInclude (int) The Altinn version to include. E.g. \u0026ldquo;mainVersionInclude=3\u0026rdquo; will filter the response to only get the Altinn 3 instances. mainVersionExclude (int) The Altinn version to exclude. E.g. \u0026ldquo;mainVersionExclude=3\u0026rdquo; will filter the response to exclude Altinn 3 instances. status.isSoftDeleted (bool) Filter instances based on whether they are soft deleted. status.isHardDeleted (bool) Filter instances based on whether they are hard deleted. Note that hard deleted instances are only included if an application owner retrieves instances, and the results may include deleted drafts. Header input parameter X-Ai-InstanceOwnerIdentifier (string)\nFilter instances based on the person number or organisation number, i.e Person:14817697543, Organisation:313541479. This header input parameter was introduced because the appearance of the person number or organisation number in a URL was not desired. Some examples:\nGet all instances of application org/app, that is at process task with id Task_2 (which is Submit, see process definition), and has last changed date greater than 2019-05-01.\nGET {storagePath}/instances?appId=org/app\u0026amp;process.currentTask=Task_2\u0026amp;lastChanged=gt:2019-05-01 Get all instances of all applications of a given application owner org that has ended date greater than 2020-03-10.\nGET {storagePath}/instances?org=org\u0026amp;process.ended=gt:2020-03-10 Get all instances of all applications of a given application owner org that have not already been confirmed completed by org.\nGET {storagePath}/instances?org=org\u0026amp;excludeConfirmedBy=org Get all instances of an application that are at a specific process task e.g. Task_1.\nGET {storagePath}/instances?appId={org}/{app}\u0026amp;process.currentTask={taskId} On query parameters specifying date time you can use the following operators:\ngt: - greater than gte: - greater than or equal to lt: - less than lte: - less than or equal to eq: - equal (can also be blank) They can be combined to define a range:\ndueBefore=gt:2019-02\u0026amp;dueBefore=lt:2019-03-01 The query returns a result object (page) which includes a collection of instances that matched the query. 100 instances are returned by default. Use size to get more or fewer instances per page. To get to the next page you have to use the continuationToken present in the next link.\nAccept: application/json { \u0026#34;count\u0026#34;: 50, \u0026#34;self\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{storagePath}/instances?appId=org/app\u0026amp;size=50\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;next\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{storagePath}/instances?appId=org/app\u0026amp;size=50\u0026amp;continuationToken=%257b%2522token%2522%253a%2522%252bRID%...\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instances\u0026#34;: [ {...}, {...}, ... ] } } "

	"content": "This page is a work-in-progress. Because we do not have details on how potential errors should be shown to the users, this is only a general overview currently. More details will be added once we have a functional understanding of how users should experience errors. Logging .Net core provides a standard logging framework that can be used to log exceptions or events to a desired logging provider (console, eventlog, azure app service, application insights). You can read more about logging in asp.net core from here.\nWhat to log? Context is very important to any warning message or error that is logged. Without context, it can be difficult to relate applicaiton failures to logs. So it is important to include the following details in the log\nWhere in the code did the application fail? Who was using the system when it failed? What was the system doing when it failed? Specify a log level that can be used to filter logs when needed Where do we log? The idea is to send the logs to the console and collect them using Application Insights (Note: Application Insights involves data limitation and costs vary based on needs). It is also possible to log to different log providers by configuring it in the config file. F.ex It is possible log only error and warning message to appinsights and information logs to console.\nThird Party Logging Frameworks There are a bunch of third party logging frameworks available for .net core. Serilog is one of them and Altinn Studio will use it to log. There are many advantages of using serilog\nIt\u0026rsquo;s open source Allows logging to many sinks like slack, azure, etc. It has support for logging to files (Microsfot basic logging doesn\u0026rsquo;t have support for logging in file at this point) It allows to define a custom message template for logging. Provides prebuilt enrichers through nuget. These add more value and information to the log events. This can be used to filter events in Application Insights. Step one - Init logger in Program.cs public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =\u0026gt; WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args) .ConfigureLogging((hostingContext, logging) =\u0026gt; { logging.ClearProviders(); Serilog.ILogger logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .WriteTo.Console() .CreateLogger(); logging.AddProvider(new SerilogLoggerProvider(logger)); }); Step two - inject logger where it is needed private ILogger logger; public ApplicationsController( IApplicationRepository repository, ILogger logger) { this.logger = logger; this.repository = repository; } Step three - log error _logger.LogError(exception, \u0026#34;Unable to process request...\u0026#34;); "

	"content": "This guide details how to set up an Altinn application to use the built-in Maskinporten authentication client (IMaskinportenClient) for making authorized requests on behalf of the app owner, as opposed to the active user.\nIn order to set this up, the following must be done:\nEnsure organization has access to Azure Key Vault. Create a Maskinporten integration in the self service portal. Store the authentication key for the integration in Azure Key Vault. Set up the application to use the Maskinporten client and retrieve secrets from Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault Access Before proceeding with this guide, make sure you have access to Azure Key Vault for your organization. This ensures that the keys created further on in the guide can be stored properly as secrets in Azure.\nIf access is missing, please refer to Access to logs and secrets.\nMaskinporten Integration In this section we will set up the Maskinporten client. A part of setting up the client includes creating keys that should be stored in Azure Key Vault later on in the guide. If different people in the organization have access to different resources needed in this process, please cooperate and do the following steps on the same machine. This is recommended to avoid sending secrets between machines.\nWhen access to creating secrets in Azure Key Vault is confirmed, please proceed to create the integration.\nVis/skjul innhold Guide on how to register a new Maskinporten integration in Samarbeidsportalen Maskinporten clients are created in the self-service portal:\nFor the production environment, clients are created from: https://sjolvbetjening.samarbeid.digdir.no. For the test environment, clients are created from: https://sjolvbetjening.test.samarbeid.digdir.no. Start by logging into your account with your chosen method. When logged into your account, the organisation you represent is shown in the top menu to the right. The organisation you represent is shown in the top menu. If you logged in to represent a synthetic organisation, you will also be able to change the synthetic organisation you represent in the drop down menu on that item. You can change the synthetic organisation you represent in the drop down menu. Select the Create client button to start creating a new client for the organisation you represent. On the Add client page select Maskinporten. On the Add Maskinporten client page fill in the display name, description and add your required scopes (these values can also be changed later). Then click the Create button. The \u0026#39;Add Maskinporten client\u0026#39; page. You have now created a Maskinporten client for your organisation. To use this client you need to add at least one authentication key. The client supports JWK and PEM keys. Start by either locating an existing key or creating a new one. You can use the Altinn JWKS tool or other key generator of your choice for this. Next, navigate to the key section on your client page and select Add. Keys can be added in the key section. In the JWK or PEM format field paste your public key and click Save. The key is now added to the client. Store your private key from your JWK or PEM in a secure location, as it is used to authorize the use of this client. If you use Azure Key Vault to store your private keys, they need to be base64-encoded before uploading. The JWK or PEM public key is pasted in this field If you didn\u0026rsquo;t do so in step 5, you need to add the desired scopes to your client before it can be used. From the Scopes tab on your client definition, click the Add button. Scopes available to your organisation will be shown in the list. Select the required ones and click Submit. Azure Key Vault Configuration When preparing the application to use secrets from Azure Key Vault, there are some steps that need to be done:\nAdd the secrets retrieved during the Maskinporten client configuration to Azure Key Vault:\nThe base64 encoded JWT public and private key pair The client ID for the integration It is important that the name of these secrets in Azure Key Vault corresponds with the name of the section in the appsettings file in the application repository. E.g. if your appsettings section for the Maskinporten integration section looks like this:\nApp/appsettings.json { \u0026#34;MaskinportenSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Authority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://test.maskinporten.no/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ClientId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;JwkBase64\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } The secrets in Azure Key Vault should have names like this:\nMaskinportenSettings--Authority MaskinportenSettings--ClientId MaskinportenSettings--JwkBase64 For the application to be able to read the secrets from Azure Key Vault, it needs to be configured to do so. See the secrets section to achieve this.\nAdd the appsettings section example from above into the appsettings.{env}.json file.\nNote: The secrets are read by the application on launch so if you make changes after the application is deployed, you will need to redeploy the application for them to come into effect.\nApplication Setup The application automatically includes the built-in IMaskinportenClient which can be injected into your services.\nConfiguration Paths The client will automatically look for a Maskinporten configuration at the default path \u0026ldquo;MaskinportenSettings\u0026rdquo;. If you wish to use a different path, perhaps because you are deploying multiple apps and you need each one to carry different credentials, you can configure this via the ConfigureMaskinportenClient method.\nApp/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // ... services.ConfigureMaskinportenClient( \u0026#34;YourCustomMaskinportenSettingsPath\u0026#34; ); } Authorizing Http Clients Typed and named Http clients can be authorized with the available extension methods, as illustrated below.\nApp/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // ... // For external APIs that require raw Maskinporten tokens services.AddHttpClient\u0026lt;CustomClient1\u0026gt;().UseMaskinportenAuthorization(\u0026#34;scope1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope2\u0026#34;); services.AddHttpClient(\u0026#34;named-client1\u0026#34;).UseMaskinportenAuthorization(\u0026#34;scope1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope2\u0026#34;); // For Altinn APIs that require Altinn tokens (exchanges Maskinporten token) services.AddHttpClient\u0026lt;CustomClient2\u0026gt;().UseMaskinportenAltinnAuthorization(\u0026#34;scope1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope2\u0026#34;); services.AddHttpClient(\u0026#34;named-client2\u0026#34;).UseMaskinportenAltinnAuthorization(\u0026#34;scope1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope2\u0026#34;); } Manual Usage If you need to fetch a Maskinporten token manually, you can inject the IMaskinportenClient in your service and retrieve tokens with the GetAccessToken and GetAltinnExchangedToken methods.\npublic class Example(IMaskinportenClient maskinportenClient) : IProcessTaskEnd { public async Task End(string taskId, Instance instance) { var maskinportenToken = await maskinportenClient.GetAccessToken([\u0026#34;scope1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope2\u0026#34;]); var altinnExchangedToken = await maskinportenClient.GetAltinnExchangedToken([\u0026#34;scope1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope2\u0026#34;]); // Do something with the tokens... } } Key Vault Configuration Lastly, we need to add the Azure Key Vault configuration provider to our host. This is done by adding the highlighted code after the ConfigureWebHostBuilder method.\nApp/Program.cs //... ConfigureWebHostBuilder(IWebHostBuilder builder); // Add Azure KV provider for TT02 \u0026amp; Prod environments if (!builder.Environment.IsDevelopment()) { builder.AddAzureKeyVaultAsConfigProvider(); } Legacy Compatibility Vis/skjul innhold Show details IMaskinportenTokenProvider Certain legacy services require an implementation of IMaskinportenTokenProvider to retrieve access tokens. The MaskinportenClient will automatically register this service if it has not already been supplied elsewhere.\nAltinn.ApiClients.Maskinporten If you need to support existing usage of the standalone Maskinporten client, while simultaneously wanting to use the built-in client for new features, it usually makes sense to leverage a single Azure Key Vault configuration.\nThe example below illustrates how to map an Altinn.ApiClients.Maskinporten.Config.MaskinportenSettings object to the format required by the built-in client.\nApp/Program.cs using Altinn.App.Core.Features.Maskinporten.Exceptions; using LegacyMaskinportenSettings = Altinn.ApiClients.Maskinporten.Config.MaskinportenSettings; // ... void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // ... var legacySettings = config.GetSection(\u0026#34;Maskinporten-Config-Path\u0026#34;).Get\u0026lt;LegacyMaskinportenSettings\u0026gt;() ?? throw new MaskinportenConfigurationException(\u0026#34;Maskinporten settings not found in config.\u0026#34;); services.ConfigureMaskinportenClient(options =\u0026gt; { options.ClientId = legacySettings.ClientId; options.JwkBase64 = legacySettings.EncodedJwk; options.Authority = legacySettings.Environment switch { \u0026#34;prod\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;https://maskinporten.no/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;test\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;https://test.maskinporten.no/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dev\u0026#34; =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;https://maskinporten.dev/\u0026#34;, _ =\u0026gt; throw new MaskinportenConfigurationException($\u0026#34;Unknown Maskinporten environment value {legacySettings.Environment}\u0026#34;) }; }); // More information about the Maskinporten environment mapping: // https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-apiclient-maskinporten/blob/main/src/Altinn.ApiClients.Maskinporten/Services/MaskinportenService.cs#L343 } If your MaskinportenSettings is configured in Key Vault, the mapping described in this step needs to take place either lazily or after Key Vault has been added as an options provider. If the configuration delegate runs too early, not all values are loaded yet. Migration Paths Vis/skjul innhold Show details In this section you will find couple of brief examples of how to migrate your existing configuration from the standalone Maskinporten client to the built-in one.\nUse of AddMaskinportenHttpClient The following example shows how an EventSubscriptionClient has traditionally been configured, and how you can achieve the same result using the built-in Maskinporten client.\nApp/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // ... // Before: Altinn.ApiClients.Maskinporten client configuration services .AddMaskinportenHttpClient\u0026lt;SettingsJwkClientDefinition, EventsSubscriptionClient\u0026gt;( config.GetSection(\u0026#34;Maskinporten-Config-Path\u0026#34;), clientDefinition =\u0026gt; { clientDefinition.ClientSettings.Scope = \u0026#34;altinn:serviceowner/instances.read\u0026#34;; clientDefinition.ClientSettings.ExhangeToAltinnToken = true; } ) .AddTypedClient\u0026lt;IEventsSubscription, EventsSubscriptionClient\u0026gt;(); // After: Built-in client configuration services.ConfigureMaskinportenClient(\u0026#34;Maskinporten-Config-Path\u0026#34;); services .AddHttpClient\u0026lt;IEventsSubscription, EventsSubscriptionClient\u0026gt;() .UseMaskinportenAltinnAuthorization(\u0026#34;altinn:serviceowner/instances.read\u0026#34;); } Use of AddMaskinportenHttpMessageHandler The following example shows how Altinn.ApiClients.Dan has typically been configured, and how you can achieve the same result using the built-in Maskinporten client.\nApp/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // ... // Before: Altinn.ApiClients.Maskinporten client configuration services.RegisterMaskinportenClientDefinition\u0026lt;SettingsJwkClientDefinition\u0026gt;( \u0026#34;client-name\u0026#34;, config.GetSection(\u0026#34;Maskinporten-Config-Path\u0026#34;) ); services .AddDanClient(config.GetSection(\u0026#34;Dan-Config-Path\u0026#34;)) .AddMaskinportenHttpMessageHandler\u0026lt;SettingsJwkClientDefinition\u0026gt;( \u0026#34;client-name\u0026#34;, clientDefinition =\u0026gt; { clientDefinition.ClientSettings.Scope = \u0026#34;altinn:dataaltinnno\u0026#34;; } ); // After: Built-in client configuration services.ConfigureMaskinportenClient(\u0026#34;Maskinporten-Config-Path\u0026#34;); services .AddDanClient(config.GetSection(\u0026#34;Dan-Config-Path\u0026#34;)) .UseMaskinportenAuthorization(\u0026#34;altinn:dataaltinnno\u0026#34;); } "

Then click the Create button. The \u0026#39;Add Maskinporten client\u0026#39; page. You have now created a Maskinporten client for your organisation. To use this client you need to add at least one authentication key. The client supports JWK and PEM keys. Start by either locating an existing key or creating a new one. You can use the Altinn JWKS tool or other key generator of your choice for this. Next, navigate to the key section on your client page and select Add. Keys can be added in the key section. In the JWK or PEM format field paste your public key and click Save. The key is now added to the client. Store your private key from your JWK or PEM in a secure location, as it is used to authorize the use of this client. If you use Azure Key Vault to store your private keys, they need to be base64-encoded before uploading. The JWK or PEM public key is pasted in this field If you didn\u0026rsquo;t do so in step 5, you need to add the desired scopes to your client before it can be used. From the Scopes tab on your client definition, click the Add button. Scopes available to your organisation will be shown in the list. Select the required ones and click Submit. Access as a service owner To retrieve data from Storage in Altinn 3 via API as a service owner, you must create an integration (client) in Maskinporten with the necessary scopes.\nThe following scopes are created by Altinn and delegated to the service owner. These scopes are necessary to use the APIs related to instances as a service owner:\naltinn:serviceowner/instances.read altinn:serviceowner/instances.write Clients with write scope can, among other things, instantiate apps on behalf of users via the app\u0026rsquo;s own API, upload data, update metadata, and process status. Clients with read scope can only read data, metadata, and events.\nIn most cases, a client for the service owner will need both scopes.\nExchange to Altinn token Altinn does not accept Maskinporten tokens directly. These must be exchanged for Altinn tokens. See details in the scenario below.\nMore information For more information, see documentation for API consumers from Maskinporten. See also authentication scenario for more details (in English). "

Simply follow along with the user guide to get started.\nFor other .Net apps, you can use this standalone library to handle authentication. The library provides extension methods to configure HttpClients to authenticate with Maskinporten based on your provided configuration.\n"

After issues with creating SSL/TLS certificates for nginx we we have written a guide for future developers to follow when creating SSL/TLS certificate secrets in kubernetes and mounting them to the nginx pods.\nDownload .pfx file At the moment of writing this guide, we store our *.altinn.studio certificate in azure keyvault and you will need access to download it from that vault. When you have downloaded the .pfx file, you can start extracting the CA certificate bundles, private key and the certificate.\nExtracting the values from the pfx file With openssl installed and in path, open a terminal and type the command\nExtracting the private key $ openssl pkcs12 -in \u0026lt;filename.pfx\u0026gt; -nocerts -nodes -out star.altinn.studio.key Extracting the certificate $ openssl pkcs12 -in \u0026lt;filename.pfx\u0026gt; -clcerts -nokeys -out star.altinn.studio.cert Extracting the CA certificates $ openssl pkcs12 -in \u0026lt;filename.pfx\u0026gt; -cacerts -nokeys -chain -out star.altinn.studio.ca.cert Assembling a SSL/TLS bundle After extracting all the certificate and keys, you will have 3 new files in the same directory that you have the .pfx file. These files will be:\nstar.altinn.studio.key star.altinn.studio.crt star.altinn.studio.ca.crt Now you can start assembling an SSL/TLS certificate bundle.\nIn the file star.altinn.studio.ca.crt you will have 2 certificate, one intermediate and a root certificate. The root certificate doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be in the SSL/TLS bundle, so copy the second certificate block (including the -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE-----) in this file and paste it at the bottom in star.altinn.studio.crt-file.\nUsing the SSL/TLS values in the kubernetes pod Kubernetes encodes secrets with base64, so you will need to encode the contents of star.altinn.studio.cert and star.altinn.studio.key files. And create a secret in the kubernetes cluster. The secret can be defined like this:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: ssl-cert type: Opaque data: star.altinn.studio.cert: \u0026lt;BASE 64 ENCODED SSL/TLS-BUNDLE\u0026gt; star.altinn.studio.key: \u0026lt;BASE 64 ENCODED PRIVATE KEY\u0026gt; The names under data will be the filenames mounted on the kubernetes pods (these will have to match with the filenames defined in the nginx.conf config file, which is a configmap).\nnginx.conf:\n... server { listen 443 ssl http2; ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on; ssl_ciphers ECDH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+3DES:!ADH:!AECDH:!MD5; ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/altinn_studio/star.altinn.studio.cert; ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/altinn_studio/star.altinn.studio.key; ssl_stapling on; ssl_stapling_verify on; ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/altinn_studio/star.altinn.studio.cert; ssl_session_cache shared:SSL/TLS:40m; ssl_session_timeout 4h; ssl_session_tickets on; ... } The path of where the certificates are mounted is described in the helm deployment.

On creation, the workflow will run and depending on the created tag matching the if-condition for the various steps, the building and publishing the NuGet package will commence.\nDevelopment lifecycle Implement all changes necessary in the NuGet package project.\nSubmit a pull request on these changes and merge changes into main.\nCreate and publish a new preview release in the GitHub repository. The tag should match the name and version of the nuget package.\ne.g: Altinn.Common.AccessTokenClient-1.2.0-preview\nOnce feature is tested ok, create a new release with an updated final tag\ne.g. or Altinn.Common.AccessTokenClient-1.2.0\nManual procedures Project setup To manually work with nuget packages the configuration below is required in the .csproj file of the project.\nBelow is an example of the required values to be able to produce nuget packages. Be sure to update the highlighted lines to reflect your project.

Navigate to the project folder. Build the project using Release configuration:\ndotnet build -c Release Pack the project into a NuGet package:\ndotnet pack -c Release --include-source -p:SymbolPackageFormat=snupkg\nThe package will now be created in {projectfolder}\\bin\\Release. Navigate to the release folder. Publish the package:\ndotnet nuget push Altinn.Common.AccessToken.2.5.10.snupkg -k [nuget api key] -s https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json Your package will now be published to nuget.org Development lifecycle Implement all changes necessary in the NuGet package project. Remember to update the package version, assembly version and file version so they match. Submit a pull request on these changes only. No implementation on other projects should be included. Once pull request is approved and changes are merged into master; create and publish new NuGet package based on master branch. Continue with implementation, referencing the updated package wherever it is needed. Remember to update all outdated references to the package and check that all tests run successfully before submitting a final PR. "

See build pipelines here.\naltinn-apps altinn-platform altinn-studio code-analysis load-test test altinn-apps There are pull request and master pipelines for app frontend and kubernetes wrapper.\nThe pull request pipeline builds a dockerimage and is triggered whenever a pull request is created or updated that modifies code related to the component.\nThe master pipeline builds a docker image and pushes it to Azure Container Registry. The pipeline is triggered whenever new code is merged into the master branch that modifies code related to the component.\nRemaing pipelines in this folder are described below.\naltinn-studio-build-app-image trigger: triggered by app developers in Altinn Studio details: builds a docker image of an app and pushes it to Container Registery. cloud component integrations: Azure Container Registry altinn-studio-deploy-app-image trigger: triggered by app developers in Altinn Studio. details: Gets APIM Subscription key if required and deploys a new helm release to the correct AKS cluster. cloud component integrations: Azure API Management, Azure Kubernetes services altinn-studio-update-deploy-release-db trigger: final step in build/deploy app image pipelines details: Sends request to designer to update status of a given buil or release of an app. PDF-generator master trigger: new code is pushed to the gh-pages branch of the altinn-studio-charts repository default: the created build is used as the artifact to trigger the release pipeline for the PDF generator to AT-environments. altinn-platform / altinn-studio Pipelines in altinn-platform and altinn-studio share the same structure. There is a pull request and master pipeline for each component.\nThe pull request pipeline builds a dockerimage and is triggered whenever a pull request is created or updated that modifies code related to the component.\nThe master pipeline builds a docker image and pushes it to Azure Container Registry. The pipeline is triggered whenever new code is merged into the master branch that modifies code related to the component.\nThe pull request pipeline for the .net app template does not build a docker image, but simply ensures that it is possible to build the app template used by Altinn Studio.\nPipelines follow this naming standard: [component]-(master/pull-request).\ncode-analysis Each component in the solution has their own analysis pipeline. The pipeline runs unit and integration tests and triggers a sonar cloud analysis of the code.\nPipelines follow this naming standard: [component]-analysis-[langugage].\nload-test The load-test pipelines are administered by the load-testing team. The pipelines run k6 tests aimed at YT01.\ntest There are automated tests that are aimed at our running solutions and that can be run in any environment.\nThe pipelines in this project have varying triggers. Some are on a schedule and regularily run in one or all of our environments. Others are triggered when a new release is deployed to an environment.\napps-and-platform-postman trigger: nightly schedule environment: at22 details: tests platform and app APIs studio-cypress trigger: final task in release pipeline for Designer environment: all details: runs cypress test in Altinn Studio to validate most common functionality. apps-k6 trigger: N/A environment: N/A details: k6 tests to verify Altinn Apps behavior platform-k6 trigger: final task in release pipeline for relevant platform components. environment: all except YT01. details: k6 tests to verify Altinn Platform functionality. Release Pipelines See all release pipelines here.\nOur release pipelines are set up with multiple stages. This allows for different policies related to deploy and varying triggers.\nCommon for all release pipelines is that they rely on an artifact containing the helm chart which is packed in Azure Studio Ops project.\nDeploy to TT02 or production requires approval from a team member. Weekly releases are scheduled for these environments.\nHOWTO Setting a variable as secret Marking a variable is secret is straight forward. Navigate to the pipeline variables.\nPipeline variable All that is needed in order for a variable to be secured in the pipeline is click on the lock icon at the right hand side.\nPipeline variable marked secret Disable sharing of secrets on github forks Disabling of secret sharing on repo forks are done by navigating from the pipeline to Triggers and selecting the github integration under \u0026ldquo;Pull Request Validation\u0026rdquo;. Here you can disable secret sharing by disabling the build on forks.\nDisable fork sercret sharing "

Eg. its used to communicate with the syncBar to get it to perform a new status check. To read more see: Window.postMessage\nUsage Dispatching a message event is done the following way:\n// variables should be used for messages var SAVED_EVENT = \u0026#39;SAVED\u0026#39; window.postMessage(SAVED_EVENT, window.location.href); Catching the event is done by adding an event listener to the component one needs to communicate with:\npublic componentDidMount() { window.addEventListener(\u0026#39;message\u0026#39;, this.eventThatShouldHappend); } public eventThatShouldHappend(){ if (event.data === SAVED_EVENT){ //Do necessary handling of correct message } } When the commponent is unmounting the event listener should be removed:\npublic componentWillUnmount() { window.removeEventListener(\u0026#39;message\u0026#39;, this.eventThatShouldHappend); } Remember to create \u0026ldquo;message variables\u0026rdquo; that make sense when comparing different messages. Example: \u0026ldquo;SAVED_IN_UI_EDITOR\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;SAVED_IN_OTHER_PLACE\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;FETCH_REPO_STATUS\u0026rdquo;.\n"

	"content": "Postman To test API endpoints the tool postman enables easy configuration and setup of various HTTP requests, read more about postman here.\nAuthentication Several of the exposed APIs requires various cookies, for instance authentication and gitea information. To be able to do requests against these APIs the cookies have to be included in the HTTP request, and configured in postman. The cookies can be found in the following way:\nIn your browser login to dev.altinn.studio/altin.studio/altinn3.no depending on what environment you are targeting Notice that the cookies AltinnStudioDesigner, AltinnStudioRuntime and i_like_gitea (among others) has been saved for the domain name you have logged in to. For Chrome cookies can be found under settings -\u0026gt; advanced -\u0026gt; cookies -\u0026gt; see all. The two cookies AltinnStudioDesigner and AltinnStudioRuntime works as auth against the Designer and APP API respectively, so if you are targeting a Designer API you should include the AltinnStudioDesigner cookie, along with the i_like_gitea cookie, and if you are targeting a runtime API the AltinnStudioRuntime cookie should be included. Cookies are easily added to the postman requests under the slightly hidden cookies setting, see:\nSet up postman tests Download and install postman native app. Import the files from src/test/Postman/Collection to the collections area in Postman. Import the environment .json file from src/test/Postman to the environments area in Postman. How to write postman tests Find the area/collection where the new test has to be added. Add a new request of type GET/POST/PUT/DELETE under the right folder. Provide the endpoint, input for the request. Make sure the variable values are accessed from environments file. Write the tests as a javascript code in the \u0026rsquo;tests\u0026rsquo; section of a request. More about test scrips Tests should have one test to verify valid response code and another test to validate the content of the response. Information about the postman collections Collections folder include postman collections for Platform API, Storage API, APP API. All collection uses altinn3.postman_environment as an environment file. One has to fill in the values (testdata) in the environment file based on the environment under test. The collections has steps that would authenticate an user and set appropriate cookies. Run Postman tests against a test environment. Open Postman and Import the Postman collection file and the corresponding envrinonment file. Select the environment file and fill in the necesary information for the required collection. Required Test data for App / Storage / Negative Tests Collection are envUrl, org(appOwner, app(level2-app), testUserName(level2LoginUser), testUserPassword(use same password for two users), level3-app, level1-app, testUserName2(level1LoginUser) Platform requests require appsaccesskey, sblaccesskey also.

	"content": "This page is work-in-progress. This is a proposed api which most likely is going to change. REST REST is an architectural style for designing loosely coupled applications over HTTP which was coined by Rob Fielding in 2000. We will define services according to REST.\nREST APIs should start with /api so that we with ease can differentiate between an rest api call and a ux-application call.\nREST APIs should start with a short word to indicate the logical domain or group of apis.\nREST APIs should be versioned, with semantic versioning: v1 major (incompatible API changes), v1.1 minor (add backwards-compatible functionality), and v1.1.1 patch (bugfix). We should strive to make REST APIs backwards compatible, hence clients should not break if we add a new parameter.\nREST APIs paths should be in lower case letters. Query parameter names should be lowerCamelCase.\nREST APIs should be resource oriented. A resources is a thing that the client and server knows about. The API provides methods to find, create, update, delete or manipulate a resource object. A resource in a system should have only one logical URI, which should provide a way to fetch related or additional data about the resource.\nREST APIs specifications should be public awailable as OpenApi 3.0 (swagger).\n/api/{domain}/{version}/{resource} Example:\nCreate a new instance resource. Post to instances with query params that identifies the application and the instance owner. This call should return identifier of the new instance resource or the json of the instance resource itself.\n/api/storage/v1/instances?applicationId=KNS-sailor\u0026amp;instanceOwnerId=1024 GET one instance or PUT to to this url to update the instance.\n/api/storage/v1/instances/23f1faab-bdb3-4cba-aed2-d515e1be6db8 Get (query) all instances that is instance owner has\n/api/storage/v1/instances\u0026amp;instanceOwnerId={instanceOwnerId}[\u0026amp;since=2017-01-01] "

Already in this phase, we identify changes that need special security considerations. Typically this is done as part of grooming to reach Definition of Ready.\nWe mark our security-related features and bugs with the label kind/security.\nIf threat modeling is deemed necessary, the label tm/yes is used to indicate this.\nDetails of security-related issues and threat modeling are in many cases kept out of GitHub.\nCode phase During the development of a feature, we have several processes and tools to help us creating secure code.\nDevelopment checklists We have a development checklists that ensures that developers and reviewers consider the different security aspects.\nSee checklist.\nIDE and tools We use both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. Those provide us with tools for static code analysis.\nStyleCop analyzes C# source code to enforce a set of style and consistency rules. See project Code Analysis verifies the code after a ruleset defined by Altinn Unit and integration tests As part of the coding process unit and integration-tests are created. Besides, to cover functionality, many of them cover security aspects like authentication and authorization.\nBuild phase Once a developer has finished coding a feature he/she must create a pull request.\nPeer Reviews All pull requests require peer review from at least one other team member.\nSee active pull requests.\nRun Unit and integration tests As part of the build pipelines, all unit and integration tests are run. This makes sure that security functionality has not been broken.\nCodeQL CodeQL is a code analysis platform for identifying vulnerabilities and preventing them from reaching production.\nThis is run for every pull request.\nSonar Cloud Every pull request is analyzed by Sonar Cloud.\nSonar Cloud analyzes the code by a defined rule set and checks the code against OWASP Top 10 and SANS Top 25.\nWe have defined some quality gates that the code need to adhere to to be able to merging pull request in to master. Our current active issues are available here.\nSecret scanning Secret scanning in GitHub is used to prevent secrets from being committed to the source code accidentally.\nTest phase Each feature added to our platform is tested.\nIntegration tested with positive and negative tests for access control where possible Manual functional tests Manual security testing for selected features Dynamic code analysis. We use different tools to perform dynamic code analysis.\nSome of the tools are:\nHCL AppScan We also regulary use third party security companies to go through our code and perform pen testing.\nRelease phase Releases are created automatically using Github Actions, and the configuration for this is part of each product repository.\nRelease notes should also be generated automatically.\nDeploy phase Deployment of the code to test and production environments are done automatically using Github Actions, and the configuration for this is part of each product repository.\nApplications and products are deployed as containers to either Azure Kubernetes Services or Azure Container Apps.\nOperate phase When the different applications are in production the DevOps team make sure that everything works as expected.\nMonitor phase During the monitor phase, the team follows up on how the different solutions are working and identifying improvements and changes.\nWe use different tools to identify security threats for our running applications.\nApplication Insights presents log and traffic information making it possible to detect different types of attacks Sentinel is used to monitor the infrastructure and anomaly detection \u0026hellip; Dependency updates We use Renovate and Dependabot to monitor updates for dependencies.\nThese tools can automatically create pull requests with updates in each repository, and each team merges these.\nCode ChecklistChecklist for security OWASP.\n"

	"description": "Hva må gjøres når Seres erstattes?",
	"content": "Denne siden beskriver hva som må gjøres ifm. overgangen fra Seres til Altinn Studio som datamodelleringsverktøy. Siden vil oppdateres i takt med utviklings- og migreringsarbeidet som gjøres så det må forventes oppdateringer. Alle XSD\u0026rsquo;er som lå i Altinn 2 pr. 06.12.2022 er importert til Altinn Studio. Altinn Studio Datamodellering Seres er et verktøy for å lage XSD\u0026rsquo;er som igjen validerer korrektheten til en XML. Det nye datamodelleringsverktøyet jobber på Json Schema som igjen validerer Json. Prinsippet er det samme, men formatet er forskjellig.\nSelv om datamodelleringsverktøyet jobber på Json Schema vil det fortsatt være mulig å hente ut en XSD hvis man trenger det, f. eks. i et mottakssystem. Json Schema vil da bli konvertert til XSD. En XSD produsert i Seres og som leses inn i ASD vil inneholde nok metadata til å kunne re-generere XSD\u0026rsquo;en slik den var. Dette muliggjør at man kan bruke verktøyet til å jobbe med datamodeller for Altinn 2 ev. lage en Altinn 3 applikasjon som leverer samme format som Altinn 2.\nSelv om både XSD og Json Schema handler om å beskrive og validere dataformater så har de begge forskjellige egenskaper og måter å beskrive datatyper og datastrukturer på. Json Schema startet som et noe mer lettvekts alternativ til XSD - noe av denne \u0026ldquo;lettheten\u0026rdquo; blir dog borte når man må kunne re-generere en XSD 100%.\nDet anbefales derfor at man starter fra bunnen av og modellerer på nytt for en Altinn 3 applikasjon hvis man har muligheten til dette, slik at man sikrer mest mulig enkle og oversiktlige datamodeller.\nOvergangen fra Seres til Altinn Studio Datamodellering - Hva må du som tjenesteeier gjøre? Verifisere at alle XSD\u0026rsquo;er fra Altinn 2 er overført XSD\u0026rsquo;er som er lastet opp til og tatt i bruk i Altinn 2 vil bli hentet ut og overført til et dedikert lagringsområde per tjenesteeier i Altinn Studio. Dette er et repository som ligger under den enkelte tjenesteeier sin organisasjon i Altinn Studio/Gitea og har navnet {org}-datamodels.\nDu finner det ved å enten søke det opp i dashboardet til Altinn Studio, eller se i listen Datamodeller på dashboardet, og klikke på den grønne repository lenken.\nFinn datamodell repository Når du har åpnet repository vil du se flere mapper, XSD\u0026rsquo;er fra Altinn 2 vil ligge under Seres mappen.\nMappestruktur I tillegg vil du se en readme.md fil som vises på forsiden av repository. Denne inneholder en tekstlig beskrivelse av alle XSD\u0026rsquo;ene som er hentet ut fra Altinn 2.\nImporterte filer fra Altinn 2 Ifm. at dette arbeidet ble startet i 2021 ble det gjort et uttrekk av XSD\u0026rsquo;er da, disse ligger igjen. Vi har kjørt et nytt uttrekk i 23. november 2022, og igjen 6. desember 2022.\nVi har ikke slettet skjemaer som allerede er overført til ny løsning selv om de er fjernet i Altinn 2.\nDet gjøres ingen endringer i XSD\u0026rsquo;ene ifm. uttrekket og overføringen til repository i Altinn Studio. XSD\u0026rsquo;ene skal være 100% like. Det er først når man velger å jobbe videre på XSD\u0026rsquo;ene at nytt datamodelleringsverktøy vil tas i bruk. Videreutvikling kan være mindre endringer for Altinn 2 ev. bygge videre på skjema med tanke på å bruke det i en Altinn 3 applikasjon.\nXSD\u0026rsquo;er som er under arbeid i Seres Hvis du har XSD\u0026rsquo;er som er under arbeid i Seres og som ikke er satt i produksjon i Altinn 2 må disse tas ut av Seres manuelt og lastes opp i repository hvis du ønsker å jobbe videre med de i Altinn Studio ev. ha alt samlet på et sted. Alternativt kan man starte på nytt med datamodellering i nytt verktøy.\nXSD\u0026rsquo;er som kun er lastet opp i TUL Her gjelder det samme som for punktet over.\nTeste nytt verktøy Har du planer om å gjøre endringer i en eller flere XSD\u0026rsquo;er som skal produksjonsettes i Altinn 2 bør endringsprosessen testes og helst gjøres med mindre endringer slik at det blir lettere å verifisere den genererte XSD\u0026rsquo;en før den lastes opp og tas i bruk i Altinn 2.\n"

En modern utviklingsplattform Et effektivt utviklingsverktøy En moderne infrastruktur En plattform for gjenbruk En platform for deling av data og erfaringer En moderne utviklingsplattform Altinn Studio er en åpen og modern utviklingsplattform\nVersjonering og samarbeid via Git Støtte for distribuert utvikling All programvare som benyttes er åpen kildekode. Også selve 3.0-plattformen. Funksjonalitet i Altinn tilgjengelig via API’er Moderne og populær teknologi, f.eks. React og Visual Studio Code Full selvbetjening Tekniske utviklere kan benytte best-of-breed utvikler-verktøy og teknologi, slik de er vant til. Et effektivt utviklingsverktøy Altinn Studio tilbyr enkel, effektiv og 100% selvbetjent utvikling og forvaltning av tjenester, også for ikke-teknologer.\nBrukergrensesnitt (GUI) API’er Arbeidsflyt Logikk og dynamikk Datamodellering Konfigurasjon og tilgangsstyring Automatisert testing … En moderne infrastruktur Altinn Studio (og tjenester som lages der) vil kjøre på en moderne infrastruktur.\nDocker containers for applikasjoner Kubernetes for orkestrering av containers Dette gir isolering mellom applikasjoner (microservices), enklere skalering og understøtter “DevOps”.\nHva kan jeg gjøre med MVP? Opprette bruker og logge inn i Altinn Studio Lage (og finne igjen) en tjeneste Finne tjenester fra andre organisasjoner Laste opp en datamodell som fungerer i tjenesten (Seres eller OR) Lage et skjemadesign med drag and drop av elementer (begrenset utvalg av komponenter) Legge inn tekster/tekstnøkler for tjeneste Legge inn regler for skjemalogikk (validering, kalkulering, dynamikk) Bruke API-oppslag i tjenesten (forutsetter Ajax kall kodet i GUI)\nEndre på standardfil for arbeidsflyt Endre på filer med versjonskontroll Legge den ferdige tjenesten i test- og produksjonsmiljø Tjenster 3.0 vs Tjenester 2.0 Skjemaverktøy Egenutviklet vs InfoPath React vs SharPoint formserver Responsivt vs ikke responsivt Arbeidsflyt BPMN vs Custom Tjenester som API REST vs SOAP Individuell API vs Generelle Ressurser Isolerte vs delte Raskt skalerbar vs lang leveringstid Dataformat JSON/XML vs XML Kontroll på logikk Full kontroll på når ting skjer i plattformen i motsetning til Infopath Shipment Inntil videre kun pull-basert nedlasting av skjemadata. Videre arbeid i MVP Fokus på infrastruktur Skyløsninger Sikkerhet Deploy av tjenester Integrasjon med tjenesteeier Understøtte piloter Detaljer løsning Tre nye løsninger\nAltinn Studio Altinn Apps Altinn Platform Altinn Studio Altinn Apps Altinn Platform Status Du kan følge utviklingen på Github.

	"tags": ["development", "front-end", "styling"],
	"description": "Guidelines for styling components in Altinn Studio",
	"content": "Summary Styling in React is done per component using a combination of Material-UI and compatible JSS.\nComponents shall not be styled with CSS classes in .CSS files.\nDifferent component types should use different styling methods, or a combination.\nProposed order of styling methods The following order is proposed when considering styling methods:\nStyled Components (Accepts props, logic, theming) Material-UI\u0026rsquo;s JSS (Accepts theming) Inline Styling, the React way (Accepts props, logic, theming. Not directly compatible with Material-UI) Shared Components Shared components should utilize \u0026ldquo;Styled Components\u0026rdquo; which can write Props directly in the CSS styling. The alternative way is handling styling via props is leveraging \u0026ldquo;inline styling\u0026rdquo; combined with Material-UI\u0026rsquo;s JSS. When using inline styling, the component\u0026rsquo;s styling will be configured in two different places. Inline style example\n\u0026lt;FormControl fullWidth={true} style={{ width: this.props.width ? this.props.width : null, }} \u0026gt; Styled Components example\nconst theme = createMuiTheme(altinnTheme); const StyledPopper = styled(({ ...otherProps }) =\u0026gt; ( \u0026lt;Popper {...otherProps} /\u0026gt; ))` color: ${theme.altinnPalette.primary.black}; background: ${theme.altinnPalette.primary.redLight}; border-radius: 0; box-shadow: 1px 1px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); font-size: 16px; padding: 24px; max-width: 550px; margin-top: 10px; z-index: ${(props) =\u0026gt; props.zIndex || 1} `; class AltinnPopper extends React.Component\u0026lt;IAltinnPopperComponentProvidedProps, IAltinnPopperComponentState\u0026gt; { public render() { const open = Boolean(this.props.anchorEl); return ( \u0026lt;StyledPopper open={open} anchorEl={this.props.anchorEl} placement={\u0026#39;bottom-start\u0026#39;} \u0026gt; {this.props.message} \u0026lt;/StyledPopper\u0026gt; ); } } export default AltinnPopper; Exception There will be examples where \u0026ldquo;Styled Components\u0026rdquo; are hard to configure using some of Material-UI\u0026rsquo;s components where \u0026ldquo;Props\u0026rdquo; with styling needs to be passed down to sub-components. Then the regular CreateStyles method from Material-UI needs to be leveraged and can be used in a combination with Styled Components.\nStyled object example\nconst styles = { searchBoxInput: { fontSize: \u0026#39;16px\u0026#39;, color: \u0026#39;#000000\u0026#39;, padding: \u0026#39;6px\u0026#39;, }, searchBoxIcon: { color: \u0026#39;#000000\u0026#39;, fontSize: \u0026#39;30px\u0026#39;, marginRight: \u0026#39;10px\u0026#39;, }, }; React component, with Styled Component AND \u0026lsquo;classes.searchBoxInput\u0026rsquo; from Styled Object example above.\nclass AltinnSearchInput extends React.Component\u0026lt;IAltinnSearchInputComponentProvidedProps, IAltinnSearchInputComponentState\u0026gt; { public render() { const { classes } = this.props; return ( \u0026lt;StyledFormControl id=\u0026#39;StyledForm\u0026#39; fullWidth={true} \u0026gt; \u0026lt;TextField id={this.props.id} placeholder={this.props.placeholder} onChange={this.props.onChangeFunction} InputProps={{ disableUnderline: true, startAdornment: \u0026lt;InputAdornment position={\u0026#39;end\u0026#39;} classes={{ root: classNames(classes.searchBoxIcon) }} \u0026gt; \u0026lt;i className={\u0026#39;ai ai-search\u0026#39;} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/InputAdornment\u0026gt;, classes: { root: classNames(classes.searchBoxInput) }, }} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/StyledFormControl\u0026gt; ); } } export default withStyles(styles)(AltinnSearchInput); Contained Components Contained components are React components which are not shared in other parts of the React application.

By default, the example contains the default value of each value type. Our experience is that this might not be very explanatory to the end user.\nTo overwrite these examples with custom ones a SchemaFilter can be set up. First a schema filter class that implements the interface ISchemaFilter must be created. Secondly, the filter class must be registered in the AddSwaggerGen method in Program.cs.\nThe result of running a schema through a filter when generating the OpenAPI specification is shown below.\n[ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8fb5a622-87e7-4f5e-b25e-215c93c3b86b\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://ttd.apps.altinn.no/ttd/apps-test/instances/50015641/a72223a3-926b-4095-a2a6-bacc10815f2d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;specversion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;app.instance.created\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subject\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/party/50015641\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alternativesubject\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/person/27124902369\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;time\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-10-29T07:22:19.438039Z\u0026#34; } ] Implementation example This example implements a schema filter for the CloudEvent model.

The interface contains a single public method\npublic void Apply(OpenApiSchema schema, SchemaFilterContext context) { } The context object will have details on the current type an example may be provided for.

In the case where the schema in the request body can have many variants where all could have the benefit of being exemplified in Swagger, request body filters should be used.\nTo overwrite the schema example with a request body example a RequestBodyFilter can be set up.

	"content": "What should be tested? In tjenester 3.0, there is a need for both testing Altinn Studio, the app designer, as well as testing apps that are developed by an app developer in Altinn Studio Runtime. Testing these two areas of Altinn Studio requires different approaches.\nTesting of Altinn Studio is to be tested automatically at the unit and integration levels of testing. Unit testing of the system involves, for example, the testing of individual javascript functions, and individual pieces of logic relating to react/UI components. At the integrasion level of test, API\u0026rsquo;s and smaller modules are typically tested: Effective unit and integration testing demands good testing frameworks that tjenester 3.0 developrs can easily pick up and use, and that can be easily integrated in the current codebase and the current build toolchain.\nTesting of workflows, and the usage of ALtinn Studio, as well as testing of apps developed in Altinn Studio, is the primary responsibility of the test developer in the team. On a regression, or end-to-end, level of test, one tests that the users whole journey through the altinn studio system, or the developed app, works as expected in relation to stated acceptance criteria.\nA good end-to-end test tool has the same requirements as tooling and frameworks that is to be put to use for unit and integration testing. Additionally, the tool needs to be give the opportunity for less technically minded app developers to quickly develop UI tests for apps they develop and deploy to Altinn Studio. The end-to-end tool should also allow the test developer to easily run a full regression test suite, as well as reduce the amount of time to run such a set of regression tests accurately.\nTooling After a discussion internally in the tjenester 3.0 team, these tools and frameworks have been decided to be put to use for testing\nUnit testing: Jest / Enzyme / xUnit Integration testing: Jest / Sinon Regression testing: Cypress The chosen tool set has been chosen for their ease of integration into the exisiting codebase, and also because they are all open source tools. Cypress also gives the possibility of recording tests with cypress dashboard, the test framework and UI test project will be the responsibility of the test developer in the team. Developers write unit and integration tests by using Jest and xUnit. See the other pages under test in this handbook for more information on how to effectively write unit tests or regression tests.\nDocumentation for the mentioned tools can be found below:\nxUnit Jest Enzyme Sinon Cypress Test in the first MVP delivery Testing in the first MVP delivery was primarily done thru unit testing with test written in xunit, and jest, as well as thru manual functional tests of user stories under development. The unit testing frameworks xunit and jest were integrated in the MVP01 delivery, and the tests are executed using pipeline definitions in azure devops. The unit test pipelines are automatically triggered both by pull requests to the altinn github repo, as well as when code is merged into master. The pipelines for unit tests can be found here for the xunit pipeline, and here for the jest test pipeline. At the end of MVP01, testcafe tests also began running in their own pipeline. The regression tests in the testcafe pipeline are run as a nightly build, and does not deploy on pull requests, to avoid slowing down and hindering the work of developers. The pipeline for testcafe can be found here\nTest in the second MVP delivery In the second MVP delivery, deploying apps created in the Altinn Studio designer to Altinn Studio runtime has been prioritized as a \u0026ldquo;hill\u0026rdquo;, or main deliverable. In this context, regression tests written with testcafe wil focus on the workflow the developer \u0026ldquo;Christian\u0026rdquo; will be using to be able to deploy on of his apps to a test environment. The goal of test automation is to reduce the time taken to run all test in the Altinn Studio regression test suite, to run these tests accurately, and free up the time of the test developer to write better test cases. Both automatic and manual regression tests are run against dev.altinn.studio to assure the quality of developed code that is to be deployed to production. Unit and system testing in MVP02 will work in much the same way as in the MVP01 delivery: Developers write unit and integration tests in their respective frameworks, and focus on testing business logic they have developed. Snapshot testing, which was begun in MVP01, is deprioritized in MVP02 as they were found to be brittle and not contributing to the overall quality of the code. \u0026ldquo;Look and feel\u0026rdquo; testing will be the responsibility of functional designers, and the test developer in the team.\nTest levels The pyramid figure below shows an overview of the different levels of test, the possible tools associated with the testing level, as well as which rle has the responsibilty for writing tests at that level.\nTestpyramiden Testdata To be be able to easily and effectively test on all levels, it can be necessary to put a tool in place to easily retrieve or store different test data. The Tjenester 3.0 team must decide on whether to creat testdata classes that can be imported in the different test projects. Another possibility is to fetch spesific pre-made dataset (for example testdata set 164/5) from a json file or similar. In MVP02 the testcafe project uses a naive testdata class, that will be expanded as the new for more complex testdata grows: TestData.js contains a class for creating users in Altinn Studio at the moment. Refer to the Jest section under test for an overview on using data in unit tests.\n#Methodology During sprint planning, the product owner, the developers, and the test developer agree on an approach for teting on individual user stories that are pulled into the sprint. A plan is then created for how the responsible role will test the required functionality, and sub tasks are created on the different user stories. It is possible, and likely, that a user story will contain tasks to develop tests on all the testing levels specified above. When a test is written and completed, it can be integrated into a testing build.\nNaming convention for element ids\u0026rsquo; Cypress has different methods of getting elements from the DOM. The easiest and most robust method of defining a selector is with a css id selector. The idea behind using html-id\u0026rsquo;s is to avoid finding elements by their relative location in the DOM, or by the element\u0026rsquo;s inner texts, as tests become brittle with these selectors due to design changs. The id\u0026rsquo;s must be unique, to ensure the uniqueness of a Selector, the following naming convention for element id\u0026rsquo;s is proposed: Id\u0026rsquo;s must be tekstbased and written in camelCase, id\u0026rsquo;s follow a logical location the Altinn Studio system, such as; \u0026ldquo;Pagelocation Submenu Elementtype Descriptiveword\u0026rdquo;. The text box element id under the GUI creator could then be assigned the following id: \u0026ldquo;designerSkjemakomponenterKnappTekstområde\u0026rdquo;.\nBuilding and deploying testcode See the pipeline hyperlinks above in this document.\n"

And it is easier to configure access to a kubernetes cluster.\nResource configuration apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1 kind: IngressRoute metadata: name: altinn-runtime spec: entryPoints: - web - websecure routes: - match: Host(`dev.altinn.studio`) # priority: 25 kind: Rule services: - name: altinn-runtime port: 5005 This is the simplest service to port over to traefik 2.0 within Altinn Studio. Since it is the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; route if nothing else matches (routes for /repos or /designer).\nPay close attencion to the priority-field. If nothing is specified it will be the length of the string in the match-field. So longer rules are higher prioritized.\nRouting Middlewares In the earlier example we can hook up middlewares. You can define middlewares in this format:\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1 kind: Middleware metadata: name: fetch-cookie-and-redirect spec: replacePath: path: /Redirect/FetchCookieAndRedirectHome/ This example is for when the designer fetches cookies and redirects to \u0026ldquo;/home\u0026rdquo;.\nThe different specs can be found in the traefik docs.\nSo first create a middleware resource in kubernetes and then you can use it in the ingressRoute like this\nname: altinn-designer-root namespace: default entrypoints: - web routes: - match: local: Host(`altinn3.no`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Path(`/`) dev: Host(`dev.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Path(`/`) staging: Host(`staging.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Path(`/`) prod: Host(`altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Path(`/`) kind: Rule strategy: RoundRobin middlewares: [] - name: altinn-designer-home namespace: default entrypoints: - web routes: - match: local: Host(`altinn3.no`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/Home`) dev: Host(`dev.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/Home`) staging: Host(`staging.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/Home`) prod: Host(`altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/Home`) kind: Rule strategy: RoundRobin middlewares: [] - name: altinn-designer-designer namespace: default entrypoints: - web routes: - match: local: Host(`altinn3.no`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/designer`) dev: Host(`dev.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/designer`) staging: Host(`staging.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/designer`) prod: Host(`altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/designer`) kind: Rule strategy: RoundRobin middlewares: [] - name: altinn-designer-repos namespace: default entrypoints: - web routes: - match: local: Host(`altinn3.no`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (Path(`/repos/`) || Path(`/repos`)) dev: Host(`dev.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (Path(`/repos/`) || Path(`/repos`)) staging: Host(`staging.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (Path(`/repos/`) || Path(`/repos`)) prod: Host(`altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (Path(`/repos/`) || Path(`/repos`)) kind: Rule strategy: RoundRobin middlewares: - name: fetch-cookie-and-redirect At the last entry in the routes element uses the middleware.

	"content": "When should you write tests? Unit testing includes testing of javascript functions and react/UI components. Listing of the highest priority of unit-testing:\nAPI calls with the correct formatted parameters Rendering of isolated components. Functions in general. Exporting and importing your component A quick way to get started testing your component is first to export the React Component:\nexport class CloneServiceComponent extends React.Component\u0026lt;ICloneServiceComponentProps \u0026amp; RouteChildrenProps, ICloneServiceComponentState\u0026gt; { and then reference it in your test the following way:\nimport { CloneServiceComponent } from \u0026#39;../../../src/dashboardServices/cloneService/cloneServices\u0026#39;; it(\u0026#39;+++ this is the test\u0026#39;, async () =\u0026gt; { const mountedComponent = mount( \u0026lt;CloneServiceComponent language={mockLanguage} services={mockServices} classes={mockClasses} location={mockLocation} history={mockHistory} match={mockMatch} /\u0026gt;, ); const instance = mountedComponent.instance() as CloneServiceComponent; } This will test the component without state, router or styles (read Material UI), so values usually passed in by Redux store, by means of routing or styles/Material UI needs to be reference as if they are props passed into the component (match={mockMatch}).\nMethods in your component Methods can be called directly from your test, or executed when clicked on UI elements (See own section). Calling methods is done like this:\ninstance.getCurrentRepositoryInfo(); instance.componentDidMount(); If you call networked functions in componentDidMount() you need to mock the networked functions before mounting.\nIf you have one function that calls another function, and you want to be sure that both functions ran at the end of the test, you can use jest\u0026rsquo;s spyOn functionality described here:\nconst spy = jest.spyOn(instance, \u0026#39;functionTwoCalledWithinFunctionOne\u0026#39;); instance.functionOne(); expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled(); You can read more about Jest.expect() here: Jest.expect()\nUser Interface and Methods In the example above, testing the actual interface is excluded. Simulating a click on an element might need to be performed twice in some cases. Simulating a click can be done using the elements ID and the simulate method from Enzyme:\nmountedComponent.find(\u0026#39;button#editService\u0026#39;).simulate(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;); ReactWrapper will pass a SyntheticEvent object to the event handler in your code. If the code you are testing uses properties that are not included in the SyntheticEvent, for instance event.target.value, you will need to provide a mock event for it to work. Read more at Enzyme\u0026rsquo;s Simulate documentation here.\nNetworked functions (get, post, put) If you are using get, post or put from the shared networking.ts component you need to mock the actual call to be able to test functions that calls either get, post or put. This can be done in the following way:\n// Add this to the import statements in you test file: import * as networking from \u0026#39;../../../../shared/src/utils/networking\u0026#39;; // To resolve the promise and and to return the value, first make sure your test is async: it(\u0026#39;should handle successfully returned data from API\u0026#39;, async () =\u0026gt; { /* Mounting goes here, commented to get markdown colors correctly const mountedComponent = mount( \u0026lt;HandleMergeConflictAbort language={mockLanguage} /\u0026gt;, ); */ // Creating the instance so you can spy or call methods directly const instance = mountedComponent.instance() as HandleMergeConflictAbort; // Spies for regular methods const spyOnClickFunctionHandler = jest.spyOn(instance, \u0026#39;clickFunctionHandler\u0026#39;); // Before you call the methods which use netowrking, you must create the spy and mock: const mockData = { isSuccessStatusCode: true, }; const getStub = jest.fn(); const mockGet = jest.spyOn(networking, \u0026#39;get\u0026#39;).mockImplementation(getStub); getStub.mockReturnValue(Promise.resolve(mockData)); // Simulate clicks mountedComponent.find(\u0026#39;button#editService\u0026#39;).simulate(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;); // OR call methods instance.clickFunctionHandler(); // Expect functions to be called, both handler and networking expect(spyOnClickFunctionHandler).toHaveBeenCalled(); expect(mockGet).toHaveBeenCalled(); // Resolve mocked networking await Promise.resolve(); // Expect something to happen expect(instance.state.networkingRes.isSuccessStatusCode).toEqual(true); }); Rejecting Promises / Error testing / Negative tests If you want to test how your component handles rejected Promises / errors, for example in your Try/Catch you can use the following modification:\n// This is the rejected version of the mock gode const mockError = Error(\u0026#39;mocked error\u0026#39;); const getStub = jest.fn(); const mockGet = jest.spyOn(networking, \u0026#39;get\u0026#39;).mockImplementation(getStub); getStub.mockReturnValue(Promise.reject(mockError)); // You \u0026#34;execute\u0026#34; the network function the same way as a resolved promise await Promise.resolve(); You can spy on the console.error with the following code:\nlet consoleError: any; beforeAll(() =\u0026gt; { consoleError = jest.spyOn(console, \u0026#39;error\u0026#39;).mockImplementation(() =\u0026gt; { return {}; }); }); // And the following inside your test: expect(consoleError).toHaveBeenCalled(); See example #2, for more detailed test\nUsing Router If you are testing a component that uses React Router, you might have to build router props and pass them to the component you are testing. Here is an example of how this can be done:\nmockLocation = { pathname: \u0026#39;pathname\u0026#39;, search: \u0026#39;search\u0026#39;, state: {}, hash: \u0026#39;hash\u0026#39;, }; mockHistory = { length: 1, action: \u0026#39;PUSH\u0026#39;

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "On the previous page, we went through how to set up a resource and the versioning requirements for the correspondence client.\nWe can now proceed to the Maskinporten setup and the application code.\nMaskinporten Setup In order to use the correspondence service, a Maskinporten client with the access to the following scopes is required:\naltinn:serviceowner altinn:correspondence.read altinn:correspondence.write To set this up, follow the general steps outlined in the Maskinporten integration guide, with a couple of modifications described below.\nThe correspondence client uses a new, internal, client to communicate with Maskinporten. Because of this, the configuration object now looks like this:\nApp/appsettings.json \u0026#34;MaskinportenSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Authority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://test.maskinporten.no/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ClientId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;the client id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;JwkBase64\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;base64 encoded jwk\u0026#34; } The correspondence client will automatically find and use the Maskinporten client, and attempt to bind to the default MaskinportenSettings configuration path.\nIf you require a different configuration path, you can configure it with the ConfigureMaskinportenClient extension method:\nApp/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // ... services.ConfigureMaskinportenClient(\u0026#34;UniqueMaskinportenSettingsPath\u0026#34;); } If you require a custom configuration flow, you can make use of the available configuration delegate:\nApp/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // ... services.ConfigureMaskinportenClient(config =\u0026gt; { config.Authority = \u0026#34;https://[test.]maskinporten.no/\u0026#34;; config.ClientId = \u0026#34;the client id\u0026#34;; config.JwkBase64 = \u0026#34;base64 encoded jwk\u0026#34;; }); } Application code Using the dependency injection framework in .NET, you can inject an ICorrespondenceClient in your service. This client can then be used to send correspondences and will be able to automatically handle the Maskinporten authorisation.\nWhen sending a correspondence, there are a wealth of properties available. While only a handful of these are required, the process of constructing the request itself can be a bit daunting. To assist with this, there is a CorrespondenceRequestBuilder interface available.\nThe example below uses the builder to construct a correspondence request using the most common options: the message itself, a notification to the recipient, and an attached file.\nYou will find all available options and associated documentation through IntelliSense in your favorite code editor.\nService registration App/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // ... services.AddTransient\u0026lt;ITheInterfaceYouAreImplementing, CorrespondenceClientDemo\u0026gt;(); } Correspondence client implementation App/CorrespondenceClientDemo.cs using System; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features.Correspondence; using Altinn.App.Core.Features.Correspondence.Builder; using Altinn.App.Core.Features.Correspondence.Models; namespace Altinn.App; internal sealed class CorrespondenceClientDemo( ICorrespondenceClient correspondenceClient ) : ITheInterfaceYouAreImplementing { public async Task\u0026lt;SendCorrespondenceResponse\u0026gt; SendMessage() { CorrespondenceAuthorisation authorisation = CorrespondenceAuthorisation.Maskinporten; CorrespondenceRequest request = CorrespondenceRequestBuilder .Create() .WithResourceId(\u0026#34;A valid resource registry identifier\u0026#34;) .WithSender(\u0026#34;Sender\u0026#39;s organisation number\u0026#34;) .WithSendersReference(\u0026#34;Sender\u0026#39;s arbitrary reference for the correspondence\u0026#34;) .WithRecipient(\u0026#34;Recipient\u0026#39;s organisation number\u0026#34;) .WithAllowSystemDeleteAfter(DateTime.Now.AddYears(1)) .WithContent( language: \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;, title: \u0026#34;Hello from .NET 👋🏻\u0026#34;, summary: \u0026#34;The message summary\u0026#34;, body: \u0026#34;The message body with markdown support\u0026#34; ) .WithNotification( CorrespondenceNotificationBuilder .Create() .WithNotificationTemplate(CorrespondenceNotificationTemplate.CustomMessage) .WithEmailSubject(\u0026#34;New Altinn message\u0026#34;) .WithEmailBody( \u0026#34;You have a new message in your Altinn inbox, log in to see what\u0026#39;s new.\u0026#34; ) .WithSmsBody(\u0026#34;Got 📨 in Altinn\u0026#34;) .WithNotificationChannel(CorrespondenceNotificationChannel.EmailPreferred) ) .WithAttachment( CorrespondenceAttachmentBuilder .Create() .WithFilename(\u0026#34;attachment.txt\u0026#34;) .WithName(\u0026#34;The attachment 📎\u0026#34;) .WithSendersReference(\u0026#34;Sender\u0026#39;s arbitrary reference for the attachment\u0026#34;) .WithDataType(\u0026#34;text/plain\u0026#34;) .WithData(\u0026#34;This is the attachment content\u0026#34;u8.ToArray()) ) .Build(); return await correspondenceClient.Send( new SendCorrespondencePayload(request, authorisation) ); } public async Task\u0026lt;GetCorrespondenceStatusResponse\u0026gt; GetMessageStatus(Guid correspondenceId) { return await correspondenceClient.GetStatus( new GetCorrespondenceStatusPayload( correspondenceId, CorrespondenceAuthorisation.Maskinporten ) ); } } Notes on authorisation In the example above, we are using the CorrespondenceAuthorisation.Maskinporten enum to indicate that authorisation should be automatically handled internally with Maskinporten. This is by far the easiest and most convenient authorisation method, but it\u0026rsquo;s not the only option available.\nIf you require custom authorisation logic while sending correspondences, you are able to supply your own delegate for this purpose.\nAn example of this could be if you for some reason preferred to use the legacy external Maskinporten client.\nBoth the SendCorrespondencePayload and GetCorrespondenceStatusPayload accepts a delegate parameter. The implementation would look something like this:\n// ... new SendCorrespondencePayload( request, async () =\u0026gt; { TokenResponse maskinportenResponse = await maskinportenService.GetToken( base64EncodedJwk: \u0026#34;...\u0026#34;, environment: \u0026#34;test|prod\u0026#34;, clientId: \u0026#34;the client id\u0026#34;, scope: \u0026#34;altinn:serviceowner altinn:correspondence.write\u0026#34;, resource: null ); TokenResponse altinnResponse = await maskinportenService.ExchangeToAltinnToken( maskinportenResponse, \u0026#34;test|prod\u0026#34; ); return JwtToken.Parse(altinnResponse.AccessToken); } ); "

	"description": "Guidelines for versioning of front-end",
	"content": "The frontends, both for Altinn Studio and Apps are set up as node modules, using a package.json to import external dependencies. In package.json for each package we can specify the version of the package. In this context, package refers to the different applications we are bulding, such as altinn-app-frontend, receipt, etc.\nEach time we make a change to a package, we need to update the version of the package to reflect the change. This is especially important in the packages related to Altinn.Apps - whenever changes are merged into the main branch, the compiled javascript is uploaded to a CDN where it can be used by the app, and the CDN supports versioning. So an app can refer to a specific version of f.ex. the app frontend.\nThe packages use semantic versioning:\nGiven a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:\nMAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes. Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. Each time a change is made to any frontend applications, the version in the corresponding package.json must be updated according to the rules above.\nThe default is for a new app to refer to the latest MAJOR version of the app frontend. If any changes are made that cause us to update the MAJOR version, remember to also update the app template, so that any new apps will refer to the newest MAJOR version. "

Check if the image scales well on different devices, like on mobile or a tablet. An image which looks good on a PC can quickly fill a smaller screen. Avoid using images with text, as it cannot be read by screen readers. How to write good alternative text It is important that alternative texts are written consequently. We recommend following the suggested method by UUtilsynet\nNever start with \u0026ldquo;Image of \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Write short and start with the most important part of the image End by saying if the photo is a photo, illustration or graphic.

	"title": "Code list from repeating structures",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "Code list made from a repeating structure in the data model",
	"content": "In the previous section about dynamic code lists we covered how to write code on the backend to generate a dynamic code list for a component. You could pass certain values from the data model to the backend to generate that code list (via query parameters), but that approach scales poorly when the query parameters would end up changing the code list frequently, i.e. when the options are functionally unique for some set of data in the data model.\nAnother approach is to set up a code list based on a repeating structure (list of objects) in the data model. Such a repeating structure in the data model could also represent a list of options for a dropdown, radio buttons, or checkboxes. This is especially useful combined with the RepeatingGroup component, as it allows the user to add and remove items from the list, and the code list will automatically update.\nThis functionality does not require the use of any RepeatingGroup component in the form layout, but it does require that the data model contains a repeating structure.\nConfiguration To set up a code list derived from the data model, use the source property in your component configuration. This property contains the fields group, label, and value. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown-component-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.group[{0}].someField\u0026#34; } } Explanation:\ngroup - the repeating group field in the data model to base the code list on. label - a reference to a text id to be used as the label for each option, see more below. value - a reference to a field in the group that should be used as the option value. Notice that we set up a placeholder [{0}] that will be replaced with the index of the repeating element. The value field must be unique for each element. If the repeating group does not contain a field which is unique for each item it is recommended to add a field to the data model that can be used as identifier, for instance a GUID. Non-unique values will be filtered out from all code lists, so not choosing a unique value can make it seem like the code list is not being correctly populated.\nAs for the label property, you have to define a text resource that can be used as a label for each option. In the example below, other values from the repeating structure is used in the label via variables in text:\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Person: {0}, Age: {1}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variables\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.group[{0}].name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.default\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.group[{0}].age\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.default\u0026#34; } ] } ] } Expression support The properties label, description, and helpText can also be dynamic expressions in this mode.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;checkboxes-component-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Checkboxes\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;checkboxes.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;checkboxes.description\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;helpText\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;if\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel.someField\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;someValue\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;checkboxes.helpText1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;else\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;checkboxes.helpText2\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.group[{0}].someField\u0026#34; } In the example above, the helpText property is set up to show different help texts based on the value of someField in the data model. If someField is equal to someValue, the help text will be checkboxes.helpText1, otherwise it will be checkboxes.helpText2.\n"

	"content": "Custom API scopes allow you to define API-level client access to your application\u0026rsquo;s instance-related APIs.\nAvailable from v8.9.0-preview.0 Scope configuration is not yet enforced in Storage APIs. This will come in a future release and the documentation will be updated. We will notify on Slack when this is available. Overview While XACML enables granular access control to the actual underlying resource (instances), the API scope authorization implements simple authorization of clients for instance-related APIs in your app (it takes effect before XACML authorization).\nThere are built in scopes for users and service owners:\naltinn:instances.read and altinn:instances.write for users (and systemusers) altinn:serviceowner/instances.read and altinn:serviceowner/instances.write for service owners These are \u0026ldquo;global\u0026rdquo;, in the sense that they give a client access to the app APIs for all Altinn apps. We support custom configuration to enable apps to have app-specific scopes, so that a given client can retrieve access tokens which have scopes that are specific to one or more apps.\nConfiguration App-specific API scopes are configured in the applicationmetadata.json file located in App/config/ within your application repository.\nExample Here is an example configuration using a similar scope structure but with a custom ID-porten scope prefix and using the [app] placeholer support (it will be substituted with the app name during runtime).\n{ \u0026#34;apiScopes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;users\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;read\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;ID-porten prefix\u0026gt;:[app].instances.read\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;write\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;ID-porten prefix\u0026gt;:[app].instances.write\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;errorMessageTextResourceKey\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;authorization.scopes.insufficient\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;serviceOwners\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;read\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;ID-porten prefix\u0026gt;:[app]/serviceowner/instances.read\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;write\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;ID-porten prefix\u0026gt;:[app]/serviceowner/instances.write\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;errorMessageTextResourceKey\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;authorization.scopes.insufficient\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;errorMessageTextResourceKey\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;authorization.scopes.insufficient\u0026#34; } } The errorMessageTextResourceKey specified above are the default values. They can be overridden at both levels, and the inner keys have precedence if set (they are optional). The value resolved through the text resources are put into the details property in the ProblemDetails 403 response when scope authorization doesn\u0026rsquo;t succeed.\nConfiguration Properties Property Description users Defines API scopes for regular users serviceOwners Defines API scopes for service owner clients read Scope required for read operations write Scope required for write operations errorMessageTextResourceKey Custom error message key (optional) API response When scope authorization fails, the app returns a 403 respons with ProblemDetails format:\n{ \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Forbidden\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: 403, \u0026#34;detail\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Insufficient scope\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instance\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;request-path\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } The detail property of the response is overridden through errorMessageTextResourceKey configuration.\nDebugging The app computes and caches required scopes per API endpoint during startup of the application. If you want to see the results of this you can enable Debug logs in your appsettings JSON file and rerun the application. Then it will log a list of endpoints and required scopes per user/serviceowner. These logs come from ScopeAuthorizationService in library code.\nRelated Documentation Authorization Policies - Learn about XACML-based authorization Authentication - Understand authentication mechanisms Text Resources - Configure custom text messages "

The user just need to navigate to the instance they would like to copy and then click on the link Create new copy\u0026quot;. The App will then create a new instance and open it in the browser ready for form filling with fields already filled in with data from the original.\nThe Create new copy functionality was introduced in version 7.9.0 of the nuget packages. See how to update the nuget references of your application here. Configuration The configuration has a retroactive effect and will also apply to previously created instances. In addition to turning the functionality on and off, it is possible to exclude data types and data fields in a schema from being copied.\nName Description enabled true/false if its possible to create a copy of an instance. excludedDataTypes List of DataTypes that should be excluded when a new copy is made. excludedDataFields List of fields in the DataModel that should be excluded when a new copy is made. Exclusion of data types It is possible to provide a list of data types you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be copied over to the new instance, but which data types that can be copied are already fairly limited. The list of excluded data types have therefor limited effect. The copy feature will only copy data elements related to a schema/form. This means that no attachments will be copied. I addition to this the data types being copied needs to be associated with the first step in the process for the app.\nExclusion of data fields The list of excluded fields can be used to indicate which fields you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be copied over to the new data element. The purpose of this feature is to empty fields you know will need to vary from one submission to the next. This could be a field that indicate which quarter of the year the submission is relevant for. Here the app developer will need to consider the different fields, the usage of the app and what would be the best for the user. The selected fields should be indicated with dot-notation in the same way as when doing data binding in layout files.\nExamples Configuration for turning the Create new copy feature on and off.\napplicationmetadata.json \u0026#34;copyInstanceSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34;: true } Configuration where the Create new copy is activated and where two fields in two separate groups within the model is being excluded.\napplicationmetadata.json \u0026#34;copyInstanceSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;enabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;excludedDataFields\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;group1.felt2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;group23.felt21\u0026#34; ] } Programing interface During the copying of an instance the logic will perform a method call to IInstantiationProcessor.DataCreation.

	"content": "It is useful to add extra information to instance objects in some cases. For example allowing routing the instance to the correct system in a service owners backend.\nThis can be done in two ways, by configuration or manually. Using configuration, the system will extract data from the form fields and add these to the instance object. This method is limited to form fields, but avoids programming it by yourself. If you choose to do it manually you have the freedom to add data you might want from for example external APIs, calculations, string constants, etc.\nIt is also possible to make use of both methods as long as you use different ids on the data fields. The configured values will then be collected together with the manual ones in the instance.\nData fields are in many ways similar to presentation fields. But where the use of presentation fields is predefined, the use of data fields is completely up to the individual application owner.\nConfiguration Configuration of data fields is done in applicationmetadata.json which is located in the folder App/config.\nAdd a new object with the key dataFields, using the following properties\nName Description id The ID of the datafield. Used to identify the field when saved in the instance. path Datamodel path to the form field. This value is the same value that is bound to a component in the app\u0026rsquo;s layout file. dataTypeId Id of the datamodel where the value is collected from. The configuration for an app with two defined data fields will look like this:\n\u0026#34;dataFields\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AnsettelseAntAar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;OpplysningerOmArbeidstakeren-grp-8819.Arbeidsforhold-grp-8856.AnsattAar-datadef-33267.value\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataTypeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Navn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;OpplysningerOmArbeidstakeren-grp-8819.OpplysningerOmArbeidstakeren-grp-8855.AnsattNavn-datadef-1223.value\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataTypeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; }] The result will be a list in the instance object with values from the configured fields:\n\u0026#34;dataValues\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;AnsettelseAntAar\u0026#34;: 10, \u0026#34;Navn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ola Nordmann\u0026#34; } Notice that the instance object is named dataValues even when the configured is named dataFields, this is because dataValues is the result of the configuration which is done in dataFields.\nManually To manually add data values the method UpdateDataValuesfrom the IInstance interface is used. It is the same method which is called when the fields in dataValues are populated from configuration and it will merge all values into a list.\nBe aware that it is the application developer\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to ensure unique IDs if you combine data values between configuration and a manual implementation. Values that share IDs will override each other and there is no way to guarantee which will be saved in the instance. The example below displays how to set data values manually. In this case it is done by adding code within RunProcessTaskEnd in App.cs, which is run when a task is completed.\npublic override async Task RunProcessTaskEnd(string taskId, Instance instance) { var customDataValues = new DataValues() { Values = new Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt;() { { \u0026#34;customKey\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customValue\u0026#34; } } }; var (instanceOwnerPartyId, instanceGuid) = InstanceHelper.DeconstructInstanceIdFromUrl(_httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Request.Path.Value); await _instanceService.UpdateDataValues(instanceOwnerPartyId, instanceGuid, customDataValues); await Task.CompletedTask; } It is recommended to think through the necessity of these values for the instance object so that it avoids unnecessary API calls which impact the performance of the application.

	"tags": [],
	"description": "Removing some options from the list",
	"content": "Filtering is a way to remove some of the options from the list. This can be useful if you want to limit which options the user can choose from.\nKeep in mind that there are different approaches to making options dynamic:\nYou can use dynamics to hide and show entirely different components based on a condition. These components could be bound to the same location in the data model, but have different options. Note that automatic cleanup may unexpectedly remove values from the data model when using this approach. Test thoroughly to ensure form data is not lost when using this method. By using dynamic options and passing query parameters to the backend, you can write custom code to generate a different set of options based on those query parameters. This may be useful, but can cause lots of traffic to the backend if the options are frequently changing. Using options from the data model you can set up options based on a repeating structure in the data model. In combination with data processing on the backend, this can be a powerful way to create custom options even when dynamic options based on query parameters would be problematic. Filtering options via the optionFilter property works with all of the above, and with plain static options as well. It allows you to use a dynamic expression to filter out options based on the current state of the form.\nConfiguration In the example below, the optionFilter property is set to a dynamic expression that filters out the option should-be-removed. Note that the optionFilter property accepts an expression to determine which options to keep. To remove an option, you should invert the logic. One way to do this is by writing the expression inside a not function call.\nThe expression is evaluated for each option, and if it returns true, the option is kept. All other options are removed.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown-component-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;should-be-removed\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Should be removed\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;red\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Red\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Blue\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;optionFilter\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;notEquals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;should-be-removed\u0026#34;] } The result of the above configuration will be a dropdown with two options: \u0026ldquo;Red\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Blue\u0026rdquo;.\nThe value function In the example above, the value function is used to access the value of the current option. This function can be used with arguments to access other values in the option as well.\n[\u0026quot;value\u0026quot;] and [\u0026quot;value\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;] are equivalent, and will return the value of the current option. [\u0026quot;value\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;label\u0026quot;] will return the label of the current option. This label is the text given in the label property of the option, before any text resources are looked up. [\u0026quot;value\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;] will return the description of the current option, if set. [\u0026quot;value\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;helpText\u0026quot;] will return the help text of the current option, if set. Used alongside options from the data model When using optionFilter with options from the data model, the expression will be evaluated for each row in the repeating structure. This means that if you look up the data model (via the dataModel function) in the expression, you will have access to data from the row that the option was fetched from.\nIf there is a RepeatingGroup component associated with this repeating structure, the optionFilter property can also look up values from the component function to access data from components inside the repeating group. The return value from this function will always be null if the row is hidden using dynamics in the hiddenRow property, even if a lookup with the dataModel function would return data from the hidden row.\nAn example using this combination:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;choose-pet\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MyPets\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MyPets.Name\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MyPets[{0}].Id\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;optionFilter\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;and\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;notEquals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MyPets.Name\u0026#34;], null], [\u0026#34;notEquals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pet-owned-by-someone-else\u0026#34;], true], [\u0026#34;notEquals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;example-cat-id\u0026#34;] ] } In this example, the optionFilter property will filter out all pets that:\nDo not have a name (the path MyPets.Name is null or an empty string) Are owned by someone else (the value in the pet-owned-by-someone-else component is true). In this example, we assume that this component is set up inside a RepeatingGroup component that is associated with the MyPets structure. Have the ID example-cat-id. Since the value field is fetched from the path MyPets[{0}].Id, the result will be the same as if you wrote [\u0026quot;notEquals\u0026quot;, [\u0026quot;dataModel\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MyPets.Id\u0026quot;], \u0026quot;example-cat-id\u0026quot;]. Example: Filtering duplicate options in a repeating group In the following animation, a RepeatingGroup component has been set up with a Dropdown component inside. The Dropdown component has a optionFilter property that removes options that have already been used in other rows in the repeating group.\nThe configuration for this example is as follows:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ingredientType\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ingrediens\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ingredients.Type\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;foods\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;optionFilter\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;or\u0026#34;, // Remove those that have been used elsewhere [\u0026#34;not\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;commaContains\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;UsedTypes\u0026#34;], [\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;]]], // But not if it\u0026#39;s the currently chosen ingredient here [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ingredientType\u0026#34;], [\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;]] ] } A few things to note about the configuration:\nThe already used types are stored in a comma-separated list in the UsedTypes field in the data model. This field is updated using a data processor that finds all the unique types in the Ingredients array. If we just checked the UsedTypes field against the value of the current Dropdown component, as soon as an ingredient was chosen, it would be removed from the list of options and would be automatically cleaned up. For this reason, we also check that the value is not equal to the data set in the current Dropdown component. The example above depends on saving the form data to the backend and running data processing to update the UsedTypes field. For this reason, it is still entirely possible to select the same ingredient in multiple rows in the repeating group if you\u0026rsquo;re fast enough. When using a method like this you should also implement validation to catch any duplicates that might slip through. "

These scopes limit what the system can do on behalf of the end-user.\nRelevant scopes for Altinn 3 are:\naltinn:instances.meta - View inbox and archive overview in Altinn altinn:instances.read - Read the content of the inbox and archive in Altinn for all items the end-user is authorized for altinn:instances.write - Fill out, sign, and submit forms in Altinn for all items the end-user is authorized for altinn:lookup - Use lookup services in Altinn altinn:reportees - See who you can represent in Altinn The image below shows how the end-user must confirm access.\nHandle systems For details on scopes and a list of all available scopes, see documentation from ID-porten.\nOnce login is completed, the system will have access to an ID token, refresh token, and an access token. The access token has a limited lifespan but can be renewed using the refresh token.\nWeb-based systems Web-based systems consist of solutions with a web-based frontend running in a browser, as well as server-side code.\nSee details at ID-porten.\nThick clients Thick clients refer to applications that are installed and run locally on a computer and not in a browser. These must still use a browser to log in.\nSee details at ID-porten.\nExchanging access token for Altinn token The access token (NOT ID TOKEN!) issued by ID-porten must be exchanged for an Altinn token before it can be used against Altinn\u0026rsquo;s APIs. This Altinn token will have the same lifespan as the access token.\nThe flowchart below shows how the token is exchanged.\nToken exchange See details in Altinn\u0026rsquo;s API documentation under the method GET /exchange/{tokenProvider}.\nEnd-users in Altinn have the ability to get an overview of all systems and their accesses. This way, long-term accesses can be revoked. The system will then be rejected the next time it tries to renew the access token.\nThe image below shows how this will be in Altinn (not yet in production).\nHandle system accesses A system that has obtained a token from ID-porten will be able to perform actions that the user is authorized for, only limited by the scope\u0026rsquo;s usage area. This means that if the system has obtained a scope for form submission, the system will be able to submit all forms for all entities that the end-user is authorized for. Therefore, it is important that the end-user can trust the system.\n"

	"description": "Considerations and explanations of how to go about when creating a multi-app solution",
	"content": "What is a multi-app solution? A multi-app solution is a solution consisting of two or more cooperating applications, where typically application A will trigger the creation of a new instance of application B. As a part of the instantiation of application B it is possible to prefill the instance with specific data from the running instance of application A.\nThis guide takes you through a multi-app solution consisting of two apps; application A and application B, but the concept can be extended to contain several applications of type A or type B, or both types.\nTerminology An Instance: When talking about instances in an application-context, these are unique pieces of data that describes details about the particular session going on in the application. The data includes information on who is filling in the data and what the data is. Application A: This will be an application that acts as a regular Altinn application which means end-users will interact with it. While filling in the form they will be working on their own private instance. However it will differ from other Altinn apps since the service owner has customized it to include actions that will create a new instance of the application B. Application B: This will be an application that may have multiple purposes, but its main purpose will be to receive and handle data from application A. This application will differ from other Altinn apps since instances are created by triggers in another application. Do I need a multi-app solution? Altinn offers a robust set of APIs and event support for processing data from Altinn Apps. However, if these options do not align with your needs, you might consider a multi-app solution.\nUse cases where you can consider using a multi-app solution: We have outlined some common use cases that may warrant the multi-app approach.\nThe organization has limited development capacity or does not want to develop and maintain a new system for processing data from Altinn. Existing setup within the organization for processing data from Altinn does not satisfy requirements for security. By implementing a multi-app solution, an organization can use the Altinn inbox for their organization to receive data. In most cases the people required to process the data will already have access to the organization in Altinn or can be granted this access. The last application in the data flow (application B in our case), can set authorization rules requiring a specific role before granting access to the data, hence supporting limiting access to sensitive data to people with an official need.\nHow does the multi-app solution actually work? A multi-app solution is a way of configuring multiple forms to communicate through API calls. The specific communication we will describe in this guide is the creation of a new instance of an application (B) triggered by another application (A). A typical scenario would be that an end-user fills out or uploads information in an instance of application A. And when pressing the button to submit the form, an API call is sent to another application (B), creating a new instance of this application where the answers from application A is a part of the information.\nAn integration between the app and Maskinporten might be required In order for an application to perform actions on another application such as creating a new instance on behalf of and end user or organisation, it needs to be authorized. By nature, the request to create the instance of application B will include the credentials of the end user filling out application A. In most cases this end user will not be authorized to instantiate new instances on behalf of the organisation that owns application B, thus this will fail. A way to ensure the application is authorized to perform the instantiation action, is to use the application owners credentials instead of the end user\u0026rsquo;s credentials. This is achieved by using a Maskinporten integration to generate a token that represents the organisation and adding this token to the requests that application A makes towards application B.\nInstructions for making a multi-app solution in AltinnExplanations of how to go about when creating a general multi-app solution\nTesting a multi-app solution in AltinnHow to test the multi-app solution while developing\n"

In the appLogic object, add: \u0026#34;shadowFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026lt;chosen prefix\u0026gt; } For example, with the prefix used in the example above, the data type would be:\n\u0026#34;dataTypes\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;appLogic\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;autoCreate\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;classRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn.App.Models.myModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;shadowFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SF_\u0026#34; } } } ] All fields in the data model that start with SF_ will then be removed from the form data upon submission so that when you later retrieve the data for processing, those fields will not be included.\nRemoval of data in shadow fields is done BEFORE generating the PDF. This is because the form data is locked before PDF generation to ensure that the data is not altered after the PDF is generated. If there is data in the helper fields that is necessary for generating the PDF, refer to the section on saving a copy of the data without helper fields below. Saving a copy of form data without helper fields There may be cases where it is desirable to keep the form data as it was upon submission and instead create a copy that contains only the relevant data (i.e., without helper fields). For example, in cases where helper fields are used to control dynamics for displaying/hiding components, which may affect the appearance of the PDF receipt.\nIf you want to keep the form data as submitted and save a copy with only the relevant data (i.e., without helper fields), you can set it up in applicationMetadata in the same way as above, but with an additional configuration specifying the data type to use for storing the copy. You can either create a separate data type (which may make it easier to find the correct data element to retrieve later) or specify the same data type that you are configuring (thus saving a copy of the same data type).\nFind the data type that points to the relevant data model. In the appLogic object, add: \u0026#34;shadowFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026lt;chosen prefix\u0026gt;, \u0026#34;saveToDataType\u0026#34;: \u0026lt;chosen data type\u0026gt; } Example with the same data type \u0026#34;dataTypes\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;appLogic\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;autoCreate\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;classRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn.App.Models.myModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;shadowFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SF_\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;saveToDataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-model\u0026#34; } } } ] Example with a different data type \u0026#34;dataTypes\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;appLogic\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;autoCreate\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;classRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn.App.Models.myModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;shadowFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SF_\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;saveToDataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-model-copy\u0026#34; } }, ... }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-model-copy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;appLogic\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;autoCreate\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;classRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn.App.Models.myModel\u0026#34;, }, ... } ] "

	"content": "What are common standard code lists? Common standard code lists are lists such as countries, counties, municipalities, genders, marital statuses, etc. that can be used in an application without the need to maintain these code lists yourself.\nThese code lists are created as a separate NuGet package that can be imported into your application. This is done to keep the core of an Altinn 3 application as small as possible and to be able to release and use new code lists without depending on having to upgrade the application (beyond v7.8.0).\nAvailable code lists The following code lists are available from different sources:\nStatistics Norway (SSB) Code list ID Description fylker The counties of Norway grunnbeløpfolketrygden National insurance base amount kjønn Sex kommuner The communes of Norway (all) land The countries of the world næringsgruppering Industrial grouping sivilstand Marital status yrker Occupations Kartverket (KV) Code list ID Description fylker-kv The counties of Norway kommuner-kv The communes of Norway with ability to filter on county Posten Code list ID Description poststed Norwegian postal codes How to add common standard code lists to the application? 1. Add a reference to the Altinn.Codelists NuGet package Open the command line to your application\u0026rsquo;s repository and navigate to the App folder where the App.csproj file is located, and run the following command:\ndotnet add package Altinn.Codelists This will add the latest stable version of the package to your solution.\nAlternatively, you can directly edit your application\u0026rsquo;s App.csproj file by adding the reference below to the \u0026lt;itemgroup\u0026gt; where you have package references.\n\u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.Codelists\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;8.0.1\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Note that you then need to explicitly specify the version you would like. See the link in step one for available versions.\n2. Register the code lists in your app\u0026rsquo;s DI container Add the following to your Program.cs file:\nservices.AddAltinnCodelists(); By calling this method, you will register all codelists across all sources. You can also register code lists one by one if you want to have control over which code lists are used or configure and customize the setup of the code list.\n2.1 Add individual sources Instead of registering all available code lists, you can choose to register only specific sources:\nSSB (Statistics Norway) codelists:\nservices.AddSSBClassifications(); This registers all SSB-based code lists: fylker, kjønn, kommuner, land, næringsgruppering, sivilstand, yrker, and grunnbeløpfolketrygden.\nKartverket codelists:\nservices.AddKartverketAdministrativeUnits(); This registers Kartverket\u0026rsquo;s administrative unit code lists: fylker-kv and kommuner-kv.\nPosten codelists:\nservices.AddPosten(); This registers Posten\u0026rsquo;s postal code list: poststed.\nIndividual SSB code lists: You can also add individual SSB code lists with custom configuration:\nservices.AddSSBClassificationCodelistProvider(\u0026#34;næring\u0026#34;, Classification.IndustryGrouping, new Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; { { \u0026#34;level\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; } }); RestCountries client: For advanced country information beyond the basic SSB countries codelist:\nservices.AddRestCountriesClient(); This registers the ICountryClient interface that provides detailed information about all countries of the world with filtering capabilities.\n3. Connect your application to the code list you want to use Use one of the code list IDs from the available code lists above.\nYou can do this either using Altinn Studio and configure the code list ID of your component in the user interface.\nOr you can configure the component by editing the optionsId property for the component in the layout file.\nCustom Configuration While the configuration mentioned above, where you use the method services.AddAltinnCodelists();, will register all available code lists with default values, there may be cases where you want to customize the configuration of a code list. The examples below will vary slightly depending on the source of the code list, as different sources offer different options.\nAdd a code list with a custom code list ID If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use the default code list ID, or if you only want to register code lists that are relevant to your app, you can register each code list individually.\nThe example uses a code list from SSB and overrides the code list ID:\nservices.AddSSBClassificationCodelistProvider(\u0026#34;næring\u0026#34;, Classification.IndustryGrouping); Add a code list with default parameters Some of the code lists accept parameters that control what is returned.\nThe example uses a code list from SSB and specifies a filter to only retrieve values from the first level (this specific code list is hierarchical).\nservices.AddSSBClassificationCodelistProvider(\u0026#34;næring\u0026#34;, Classification.IndustryGrouping, new Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt;() { { \u0026#34;level\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; } }); The default parameters are a collection of name/value pairs that allow you to pass in any parameter that can be picked up by the implementation of the code list provider.\nAdd a code list that supports description and/or help text values While a regular code list is just a key/value pair, you can extend it by adding description and help texts, which provide a more descriptive user interface.\nThe following example makes the notes field from the SSB classification fill out the description text.\nservices.AddSSBClassificationCodelistProvider(\u0026#34;næring\u0026#34;, Classification.IndustryGrouping, new ClassificationOptions() { MapNotesToDescription = true }, new Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt;() { { \u0026#34;level\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; } }); The example activates a predefined way to add a description text. If you want to customize the description text even further, you can pass in a function. The example below passes in a function that will be evaluated when the code list is populated and will return a combination of the classification code and the notes field, separated by a colon.\nservices.AddSSBClassificationCodelistProvider( \u0026#34;næring\u0026#34;, Classification.IndustryGrouping, new ClassificationOptions() { MapDescriptionFunc = (classificationCode) =\u0026gt; $\u0026#34;{classificationCode.Code}: {classificationCode.Notes}\u0026#34; }, new Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt;() { { \u0026#34;level\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; } }); Add a code list from SSB that is not available in the Classification enum. Currently, only a small subset of the available code lists from SSB is included in the Classification enum. The enum is essentially just a more readable version of the underlying ID used by SSB. But in our case, it also serves as a way to indicate which code lists we have explicitly tested against. If you find a code list you would like to use, you can specify its ID directly instead of using the enum.\nservices.AddSSBClassificationCodelistProvider(\u0026#34;næring\u0026#34;, 6); Overview of available code lists from SSB or here for the JSON variant.\n"

	"content": "In some cases it is desirable that one of the options is pre-selected. There are different ways to achieve this.\nIn the data model, you can prefill the field with the desired value. Note that the value must also belong to one of the valid options for components linked to this field in the data model, otherwise the value will be automatically cleaned up. While filling out the form, you can also use data processing to set the field to a desired pre-selected value. Beware that in some cases it is important to allow the user to not choose an option. If the field is simply overwritten when it lacks a value, the user will not be able to remove a pre-selected option using this approach. Use the preselectedOptionIndex property, as described here. This allows the component itself to automatically choose a numbered position in the list of options as pre-selected. The preselectedOptionIndex property This property is available for most components that support options, with the notable exception of the FileUploadWithTag component. Only one option can be pre-selected at this time, and it is not possible to choose which option should be pre-selected based on the value property of the option. This property allows you to choose an option as pre-selected. It takes an integer as an argument, which is the index of the option that should be pre-selected. The index starts at 0 for the first option, 1 for the second option, etc.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-component-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Checkboxes\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;options\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;red\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Red\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;blue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Blue\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;green\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Green\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;preselectedOptionIndex\u0026#34;: 1 } In the configuration above, \u0026ldquo;Blue\u0026rdquo; will be pre-selected when the component is displayed. The user can still choose another option, and since this is a multi-select component, the user can also remove the pre-selection by clicking the pre-selected option again.\nThis functionality follows a set of rules:\nIf the data model already has a value for the field, the pre-selection will not be set. If a pre-selected value has already been set earlier (and e.g. deselected), this will not happen again as long as the app is open in the browser. If the user reloads the page, the pre-selection may be set again. The pre-selection is set as soon as the page has loaded and the components are ready, regardless of whether the component is visible on the screen or not. Pre-selected values are not set for components that are hidden using dynamics. If the component is shown again later, the pre-selection may be set. The preselected option is determined after filtering, but before sorting is applied. There are situations where pre-selection with this property is not optimal, and can lead to situations that may be perceived as erroneous:\nIf an option is selected, the user deselects it, and reloads the form later, the pre-selection will be set again - even if the component is on a page the user has already filled out and won\u0026rsquo;t see again. When the form is submitted via the API, pre-selections set with this property will have no effect. This property requires that the form is open in the browser to work. If the form is in a state where the data model is not writable or locked (e.g. in the PDF generator), setting pre-selected values can lead to error messages and failed submissions. For these reasons, it is recommended to use this property with caution, and to consider one of the other alternative methods for pre-selection described above.\n"

	"description": "How to set up automatic filling of form data with your own code.",
	"content": "What does this feature do? You can create your own code to automatically fill out parts of the form before the user begins. This gives you more flexibility than the standard configuration file. For example, you can:\nFetch data from an API Perform calculations Use other logic of your choice When should I use this? If you need other data sources than those that are available through configuration based setup of prefill, or if you need any logic as part of the prefill process.\nHow to set it up v7 In version 7, we use dependency injection for custom prefilling.\n1. Create a new class Create a new file in your app project. You can choose the name and location yourself, but use sensible namespaces. For example, Altinn.App.Logic.Instantiation or similar.\nThe class must implement the IInstantiationProcessor interface from Altinn.App.Core.Features.\n2. Write the code for automatic filling Implement the DataCreation method in the new class. In this method, you set up which fields should be filled out automatically and what value they should receive. This is where you can fetch data from external sources, perform calculations or other relevant logic.\nSee below for examples.\n3. Register your class Open Program.cs and add this line:\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;IInstantiationProcessor, MyFilling\u0026gt;(); v4, v5, v6 For versions 4, 5, and 6, custom prefilling is implemented in InstantiationHandler.cs.\n1. Find the correct file Go to the App/logic folder in your app project and open the file InstantiationHandler.cs.\n2. Implement the DataCreation method Write your code in the DataCreation method. Here you set up which fields should be filled out automatically and what value they should receive. This is where you can fetch data from external sources, perform calculations or other relevant logic.\nSee below for examples.\nExamples v7 Example: Retrieve organization number and name from the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities This fills in the Organization.OrgNr field with a custom organization number:\nNote that the field names here are just imaginary examples, adapt to your needs/data.\nusing System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Models; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.Logic.Instantiation; public class MyFilling : IInstantiationProcessor { public async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { if (data is DataModel form) { form.Organization = new Organization { OrgNr = \u0026#34;987654321\u0026#34;, Name = \u0026#34;TestOrganization\u0026#34; }; } await Task.CompletedTask; } } Example: Retrieve personal identification number and name from the National Population Register This fills in the Person.PersonalId field with a personal identification number and the Person.Name field with a name.\nNote that the field names here are just imaginary examples, adapt to your needs/data.\nusing System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Models; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.Logic.Instantiation; public class MyFilling : IInstantiationProcessor { public async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { if (data is DataModel form) { form.Person = new Person { Personnr = \u0026#34;11223345678\u0026#34;, Navn = \u0026#34;Test Testesen\u0026#34; }; } await Task.CompletedTask; } } v4, v5, v6 Example: Retrieve organization number and name from the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities This fills in the Organization.OrgNr field with a custom organization number:\nNote that the field names here are just imaginary examples, adapt to your needs/data.\npublic async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data) { if (data is DataModel form) { form.Organization = new Organization { OrgNr = \u0026#34;987654321\u0026#34;, Name = \u0026#34;TestOrganization\u0026#34; }; } } Example: Set personal identification number and name This fills in the Person.PersonalId field with a personal identification number and the Person.Name field with a name.\nNote that the field names here are just imaginary examples, adapt to your fields/data.\npublic async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data) { if (data is DataModel form) { form.Person = new Person { PersonalId = \u0026#34;11223345678\u0026#34;, Name = \u0026#34;Test Testesen\u0026#34; }; } } Tips You can make queries against external sources to retrieve data that can then be used for prefilling. Remember that all names/fields in the examples must be replaced with names of the class/fields for your data model. Use a good code editor to get help finding the correct field names (intellisense). Remember to create objects for complex types before filling in sub-elements. "

In yaml indents should be spaces and not tabs, tab will cause the file to not be interpreted as a yaml file. The last part of the file should look something like this after your changes are complete.\nHow to make use of secrets in your application You can either add Azure Key Vault as a config provider and use the IOptions pattern to read secrets, or you can use the ISecretsClient service, which is exposed in the application and can be dependency injected into the class where you need to retrieve a secret.\n1. Azure Key Vault as config provider (recommended) If this approach is chosen, you can use Azure Key Vault in the standard way via IOptions-pattern.\nThe Altinn.App.Api.Extensions namespace contains a helper method for this purpose:\nIHostApplicationBuilder.AddAzureKeyVaultAsConfigProvider() This method can be used in Program.cs like this:\nConfigureWebHostBuilder(IWebHostBuilder builder); // Add Azure KV provider for TT02 \u0026amp; Prod environments if (!builder.Environment.IsDevelopment()) { builder.AddAzureKeyVaultAsConfigProvider(); } The call to AddAzureKeyVaultAsConfigProvider must occur after the method ConfigureAppWebHost has been executed, otherwise the app will fail to start.

Using ISecretsClient If you do not wish to add Azure Key Vault as a config provider, you can alternatively use the ISecretsClient service, which is a wrapper around the retrieval of secrets from Azure Key Vault. This service offers methods for fetching individual secrets as needed.\nCode example In this section, you will find an example of how to use a secret to populate a form field during instantiation.\nThe logic is implemented in InstantiationHandler.cs.\nusing Altinn.App.Models; using Altinn.App.Services.Interface; using Altinn.App.Services.Models.Validation; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; using Altinn.App.Core.Internal.Secrets; using System.Threading.Tasks; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic; public class InstantiationHandler { private IProfile _profileService; private IRegister _registerService; private ISecretsClient _secretsClient; /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Set up access to profile and register services /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public InstantiationHandler(IProfile profileService, IRegister registerService, ISecretsClient secretsClient) { _profileService = profileService; _registerService = registerService; _secretsClient = secretsClient; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Run events related to instantiation /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;remarks\u0026gt; /// For example custom prefill. /// \u0026lt;/remarks\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;instance\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Instance information\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;data\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The data object created\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; public async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data) { if (data.GetType() == typeof(Skjema)) { Skjema model = (Skjema)data; model.etatid = await _secretsClient.GetSecretAsync(\u0026#34;secretId\u0026#34;); } await Task.CompletedTask; } } The class contains a private variable to store the secrets client. private ISecretsClient _secretsClient; The ISecretsClient service is injected in the constructor and is assigned to the private variable. public InstantiationHandler(IProfile profileService, IRegister registerService, ISecretsClient secretsClient) { _profileService = profileService; _registerService = registerService; _secretsClient = secretsClient; } The relevant secret is fetched from Azure Key Vault (or local mock). await _secretsClient_.GetSecretAsync(\u0026#34;secretId\u0026#34;); Local mock To run your service locally without connecting to Azure Key Vault, you need to create a file named secrets.json under the App folder.

	"description": "In an application one can facilitate uploading file attachments both via GUI and API.",
	"content": "Methods for uploading file attachments In an Altinn application there are two options for uploading file attachments:\nFile upload component in a form API-call to app backend The former will be a good alternative for all data where it is expected that the user will upload files through the user interface in the app. The latter is recommended for use if it is only expected that systems will upload the attachment. There is no limit to how many attachments that can be included in one application and both upload methods can be used within the same application.\nBelow is a simple description of how you can accommodate your application to be able to receive attachments.\nSubmitting file attachments with file upload component in a form When building your form in Altinn Studio, a file upload component is available. It is possible to upload multiple file attachments on one single component, and how many file upload components you use in your application will be determined by the characteristics of the documents you expect to be uploaded and any restrictions you need to impose. (see configuration of file attachments for more information on this).\nNote: It will also be possible to upload file attachments of the type defined in the attachment component through API.\nThe file upload component The image above shows the file upload component in Altinn Studio. Part of the configuration for the uploaded attachments can be set up here.\nCustom file types can be specified if you want to limit the file types that can be submitted. In this case, a user will be prevented from uploading if the file type is not in the approved list. The minimum/maximum amount of file attachments can be specified if you want a specific amount of attachments uploaded through the component. By setting the value of minst antall filvedlegg to \u0026lsquo;0\u0026rsquo; it will not be required to upload a file. The maximum file size is specified in MB. Additional configurations that can be set for attachments include: allowed contributors and description. This is configured in applicationMetadata.json which is placed under App/config in the application repo.\nFile upload component with tagging There is also a separate component where the user tags the file using a dropdown list. This is configured pretty similarily to the normal file upload component, with the addition of a code list ID and the name you want the tag to have.\nThe file upload component with tagging Below you can see it in use\nThe file upload with tagging example File upload component with delete warning Determines whether a warning panel will open when the user presses the “Delete” button. The default behaviour if the parameter is not set, is for the warning panel not to be displayed.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;attest\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;FileUpload\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;alertOnDelete\u0026#34;: true } Submission of attachments with API-call To accommodate being able to submit attachments without this being supported in GUI, you will need to add a datatype object in the applicationMetadata.json (the file is under App/config in the application repo). It will then only be possible to submit attachments of this type through API-calls. For a more detailed description of the available fields, see configuration of attachments\nConfiguration of attachments In applicationMetadata.json (placed in App/config in the application repo) you will find a property called \u0026lsquo;dataTypes\u0026rsquo;. Configuration of all data types supported in the application can be found here, both form data (app model data) and file attachments. The field appLogic, that can also be found among some of the objects in the list, should only be used for form data.\nBelow there are two examples of dataTypes-instances from a deployed application.\n\u0026#34;dataTypes\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;53a50f0d-2345-448d-9fba-f18e6bbe71f8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxSize\u0026#34;: 25, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;:[\u0026#34;application/pdf\u0026#34;] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;attest\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxSize\u0026#34;: 25, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;allowedContributers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;org:nav\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;orgNo:XXXXXXXXXX\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;grouping\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Attester\u0026#34;, } ] Id on the attachment type This will be set as a GUID if you use an attachment component from Altinn Studio like the one you can find in the first element in the dataTypes list.

This value must be identical to one of the tasks in process.bpmn.\nmaxSize denotes the maximum allowed size of the attachment.\nmaxCount denotes the upper limit for how many attachments of this type that are to be uploaded per instance.\nminCount denotes the lower limit for how many attachments of this type that are to be uploaded per instance. If the value is 0 then it is not required to upload a file attachment of this type.\nallowedContributors specifies who is allowed to create and/or modify file attachments of this type. This is specified on the format {key}:{value}. Allowed keys include: \u0026lsquo;org\u0026rsquo;; three letter abbreviation for organization and *orgNo\u0026rsquo;; organization number. It is as of today not possible to specify an organization that is not registered as a service owner.\nallowedContentTypes specifies which file attachment types that are allowed. The most frequently used include: application/pdf, text/xml, image/jpeg. If you do not want to set a limit to the type of attachments, you will not need to define this parameter. Read more on mime types here.\ngrouping denotes the group that the file attachments should be grouped according to. This is an optional attribute, where file attachments with the same grouping will be sorted into the same list. Grouping can be both a string (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Certificates\u0026rdquo;) or a text key if you wish to configure multiple languages (e.g. \u0026quot; form.attachmentgrouping\u0026quot;).

In order to add support for eFormidling in your application you need to register it\u0026rsquo;s services by adding the following to Program.cs:\nservices.AddEFormidlingServices\u0026lt;EFormidlingMetadata, EFormidlingReceivers\u0026gt;(config); v4, v5, v6 Adding support for eFormidling in App.cs The next step in setting up support of eFormidling , is to make the required services available for the application. All changes are made in App.cs, which you fill find in the _App/logic folder.\nAt the top of the file, among the library references, include the following three lines.\nusing Altinn.Common.EFormidlingClient.Models; using Altinn.Common.EFormidlingClient; using Altinn.Common.AccessTokenClient.Services; Further, you need to inject services in the constructor of both the class and the base class.\nBefore making any changes, the constructor should look like the example below, but which services are included may vary from application to application. This shows the most common setup.\npublic App( IAppResources appResourcesService, (...) IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor):base( appResourcesService, (...) httpContextAccessor) The list of services in the constructor should be extended with the four services listed below.\nIEFormidlingClient eformidlingClient, IOptions\u0026lt;AppSettings\u0026gt; appsettings, IAccessTokenGenerator tokenGenerator, IOptions\u0026lt;PlatformSettings\u0026gt; platformSettings Further, these services should be forwarded to the base class as well, but in this case only include the names, not the types.\neformidlingClient, appsettings, platformSettings, tokenGenerator Final result should look like this:\npublic App( IAppResources appResourcesService, (...) IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor, IEFormidlingClient eformidlingClient, IOptions\u0026lt;AppSettings\u0026gt; appsettings, IAccessTokenGenerator tokenGenerator, IOptions\u0026lt;PlatformSettings\u0026gt; platformSettings):base( appResourcesService, (...) httpContextAccessor, eformidlingClient, appsettings, platformSettings, tokenGenerator) Configuring key values for eFormidling in your application Metadata related to the eFormidling shipment is required, and this is set up in applicationmetadata.json. You find the file in the App/config folder.\nCreate a new section eFormidling and populate values for the parameters defined in the table.\nId Description serviceId Id that specifies the shipment type DPO*, DPV, DPI or DPF* dpfShipmentType The DPF shipment type used for routing in the receiving system process Id which wil be included in the scope of the StandardBusinessDocumentHeader** dataTypes List of data types to automatically include in the shipment sendAfterTaskId Id of the task to be completed before the shipment is sent.

Read about the various message types available in eFormidling.\nIn versions 4, 5 and 6 this was achieved by including the function below in App.cs. While in version 7 this is done by adding a class that implements the IEFormidlingMetadata interface which has the same method signature. Remember that in version 7 your implementation need to be registered in Program.cs.\nExpected output from this function is a tuple containing two elements. First, the name of the metadata file and then a stream containing the metadata.\n/// \u0026lt;inheritdoc /\u0026gt; public override async Task\u0026lt;(string, Stream)\u0026gt; GenerateEFormidlingMetadata(Instance instance) { Altinn.Common.EFormidlingClient.Models.Arkivmelding arkivmelding = new (); // bygg opp arkivmeldingen eller annet metadataobjekt her. MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream(); XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Altinn.Common.EFormidlingClient.Models.Arkivmelding)); serializer.Serialize(stream, arkivmelding); stream.Position = 0; StreamContent streamContent = new StreamContent(stream); streamContent.Headers.ContentType = MediaTypeHeaderValue.Parse(\u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34;); return await Task.FromResult((\u0026#34;arkivmelding.xml\u0026#34;, stream)); } Dynamically setting the shipment receiver This functionally can be used whenever the receiver of a shipment is to be determined dynamically.\nv7 In version 7 the GetEformidlingReceivers method is moved to the IEFormidlingReceivers interface. Create a class that implements this interface and register the implementation in Program.cs. Below is a skeleton example for the implementation.\npublic async Task\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;Receiver\u0026gt;\u0026gt; GetEFormidlingReceivers(Instance instance) { Identifier identifier = new Identifier { Authority = \u0026#34;iso6523-actorid-upis\u0026#34; }; // 0192 prefix for all Norwegian organisations. identifier.Value = \u0026#34;[INSERT ORGANISATION NUMBER HERE WITH PREFIX `0192:`]\u0026#34; ; Receiver receiver = new Receiver { Identifier = identifier }; return new List\u0026lt;Receiver\u0026gt; { receiver }; } v4, v5, v6 In App.cs it is possible to override the method retrieving the receiver from applicationmetadata.json. Three steps are required when defining the receiver in the application logic, and all steps are executed in App.cs.\nAt the top of the file, a reference to the eFormidling library must be included. using Altinn.Common.EFormidlingClient.Models.SBD; Include the function below in the class.\nExpected output from this method is a list containing at least one receiver object. public override async Task\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;Receiver\u0026gt;\u0026gt; GetEFormidlingReceivers(Instance instance) { Identifier identifier = new Identifier { Authority = \u0026#34;iso6523-actorid-upis\u0026#34; }; // 0192 prefix for all Norwegian organisations. identifier.Value = \u0026#34;[INSERT ORGANISATION NUMBER HERE WITH PREFIX `0192:`]\u0026#34; ; Receiver receiver = new Receiver { Identifier = identifier }; return new List\u0026lt;Receiver\u0026gt; { receiver }; } Add custom logic to populate identifier.Value in the function.\nNote that only Norwegian organisations are supported, and that the prefix 0192: is required before the organisation number. Testing eFormidling integration locally It is possible to test the eFormidling integration for an application in your development environment. In addition to Altinn\u0026rsquo;s Local test, and the application, there are two things that need to run:\neFormidling integration point (Integrasjonspunktet) A mock of eFormidling Setup Install the latest version of Java.\nDownload link and installation guide is available here In the next steps you will be downloading a number of files. Define a suitable placement for everything eFormidling related on your local machine and navigate there in your terminal. Clone the eFormidling mock repository with the following command git clone --branch development https://github.com/felleslosninger/efm-mocks.git Download the integration point.\nThe contents can be places at the same level as the efm-mocks folder. Running eFormidling locally Open a terminal and navigate to efm-mocks (Command prompt or bash is recommended, PowerShell will not work.) Run docker-compose up -d Navigate to the folder where the integration point file exists. Run the command java -Xmx2g -Dspring.profiles.active=mock -jar integrasjonspunkt-2.2.6.jar If you have a newer version of the integration point, the commands last section should be adjusted to reflect this. This has a known issue that prevents it from running on Docker Desktop on Windows, but works on Mac.\nVerify that eFormidling is set up correctly This requires that node and npm is present on your machine, but they are note required to use the mock.\nOpen a terminal and navigate to efm-mocks/tests/ Run npm i Navigate into the folder next-move Run node NextMove.js dpf Verify in a browser at localhost:8001 that there are new table entries containing the sent messages. Read more about the mock here\nTesting eFormidling integration in a test environment Thorough testing for the eFormidling integration in an application is encouraged. Safety measures and retry mechanisms are in place to ensure that a shipment reaches the receiver when errors are due to weak network connections. However, invalid shipments, including but not limited to missing attachments or mistakes in the \u0026ldquo;arkivmelding\u0026rdquo;, will cause the shipment to fail without an explicit warning to the end user or app owner. The integration point exposes endpoints that allow you to monitor the status of a shipment in the test environment. https://platform.tt02.altinn.no/eformidling/api/conversations?messageId={instanceGuid}\nReplace {instanceGuid} with the guid of the instance that has been archived.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "How to configure prefill for an app based on query parameters.",
	"content": "Altinn apps support prefill based on query parameters.\nNote: Requires minimum version v4.18.0 of frontend, v8.6.0 of backend to work.\nThis allows users to click a link like https://ttd.apps.tt02.altinn.no/ttd/stateless-app/set-query-params?jobTitle=designer, and have the word \u0026lsquo;designer\u0026rsquo; be prefilled into a datamodel field.\nHowever, there are a few important caveats regarding security when using this approach.\nFirstly, query parameter prefill can only be used in a stateless task. If we did not have this requirement, it would be possible to for an attacker to change the value in the parameter and have that value show up directly in the receivers altinn inbox.\nBy going via a stateless task, we ensure that the data is displayed to the user before instantiating, so that the user is still in control of what data is saved.\nSecond we highly recommend inspecting the value of the query parameters in your application. This way you ensure that only valid data can be prefilled, so that an attacker can\u0026rsquo;t send someone a link like:\naltinn.no/ttd/stateless-app/set-query-params?jobTitle=Im a scammer\nand have the text \u0026ldquo;Im a scammer\u0026rdquo; show up in your application.\nHow to configure query parameter prefill 1. configure \u0026lt;stateless_datamodel\u0026gt;.prefill.json In your models folder, create a file called \u0026lt;stateless_datamodel\u0026gt;.prefill.json (if the name of your model is tax_return, the file should be called tax_return.prefill.json).\nExample:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/prefill/prefill.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;QueryParameters\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;jobTitle\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;JobTitle\u0026#34; } } This requires you to have a field called JobTitle in your datamodel, and allows you to prefill this field with a link like:\nhttps://ttd.apps.tt02.altinn.no/ttd/stateless-app/set-query-params?jobTitle=designer\nImportant note: the link to prefill only works on the path :org/:app/set-query-params, like in the example above.\nAlso note that only query parameters defined in \u0026lt;stateless_datamodel\u0026gt;.prefill.json will work. If you try to link to https://ttd.apps.tt02.altinn.no/ttd/stateless-app/set-query-params?somethingelse=designer, you will get an error.\n2. Configure InstantiationProcessor and InstantiationButton Follow the steps here: Starting an instance from a stateless form\n3. (Optional but highly recommended) validate query parameter values To validate query parameter values, implement in your /logic folder. Here is barebones example:\nusing System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.DataProcessing { public class ValidateQueryParamPrefill : IValidateQueryParamPrefill { public async Task PrefillFromQueryParamsIsValid(Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { // For example, only \u0026#34;Developer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Manager\u0026#34;, or \u0026#34;Tester\u0026#34; are allowed for JobTitle if (prefill.TryGetValue(\u0026#34;JobTitle\u0026#34;, out var jobTitle)) { var allowedJobTitles = new HashSet\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; { \u0026#34;Developer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Manager\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Tester\u0026#34; }; if (!allowedJobTitles.Contains(jobTitle)) { throw new Exception($\u0026#34;Invalid JobTitle \u0026#39;{jobTitle}\u0026#39;.\u0026#34;); } } // No issues found await Task.CompletedTask; } } } "

	"content": "Standard .NET configuration Altinn 3\u0026rsquo;s app template is based on an ASP.Net Core application and has a multitude of possibilities for controlling configuration of an app. This documentation is therefore in large part quotes from or links to Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s own documentation . However, not everything is possible in an application because Altinn 3 does not give full access to the environment an app is run within.\nappsettings.json The first and simplest source for configuration information are the appsettings files. Every new app which is created will come with an existing appsettings.json file. This file is read by an app during startup independently of what environment the app runs in. This means the file should only contain settings which are equal in all environments. The file contains some settings that are already in use and the values are in large part meant for a development environment where the application is run within LocalTest\nIn appsettings.json the values are organized in different sections. It is not recommended to add new values to the existing sections, creating new sections is recommended. The following sections are reserved to avoid collisions: Kestrel, AppSettings, GeneralSettings, PlatformSettings, PEPSettings, ApplicationInsights, kvSettings.\n{ \u0026#34;ExampleSection\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ExampleValue\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Verdi lest inn i alle miljøer, men kanskje overstyrt av miljøspesifikke kilder\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;AppSettings\u0026#34;: { ... }, \u0026#34;GeneralSettings\u0026#34;: { ... }, \u0026#34;PlatformSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ApiStorageEndpoint\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://localhost:5101/storage/api/v1/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ApiRegisterEndpoint\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://localhost:5101/register/api/v1/\u0026#34;, ... }, \u0026#34;ApplicationInsights\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;InstrumentationKey\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;retrieved from environment at runtime\u0026#34; } } In the future new apps will have a designated section which is simple to expand. In the meantime we refer to Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s own documentation for how this should be done.\nEnvironment specific appsettings A new app will contain a set of environment specific appsettings files: appsettings.Development.json, appsettings.Staging.json and appsettings.Production.json. These files are read in their respective environments. The TT02-environment is defined as staging and the production environment is defined as Production.\nEvery file should contain the values which are unique or different in at least one of the environments. Examples of values that vary from environment to environment is the \u0026ldquo;timeout\u0026rdquo; values. You might want an app to wait longer for a response from an external API during development than what you want to allow during production.\nappsettings.Development.json { \u0026#34;ExampleSection\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ExampleValue\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Verdi lest inn kun for utviklingsmiljø\u0026#34; } } appsettings.Staging.json { \u0026#34;ExampleSection\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ExampleValue\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Verdi lest inn kun for TT02\u0026#34; } } appsettings.Production.json { \u0026#34;ExampleSection\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ExampleValue\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Verdi lest inn kun for produksjon\u0026#34; } } Environment variables Standard behaviour for an ASP.Net application is to read Environment variables. This is also done for an app, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t possible for an app developer to create or change any of these values. Altinn 3 considers the other method of controlling Environment specific variables to be covered by appsettings and KeyVault.\nCommand line arguments It is technically possible to override all other data sources by using command line arguments. It is however not possible to use this to change values from one environment to another.\nAzure KeyVault Every application owner should have access to their own Azure KeyVault for storage of sensitive values. Sensitive values includes values which you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be visible in code or configuration files. Examples include usernames and passwords for external APIs, certificates, private keys, etc.\nCurrently values from KeyVault are not read into the configuration control of an App. Instead the secrets component is used. This is documented under Secrets.\n"

	"description": "How to configure behavior at the application startup.",
	"content": "Introduction to stateless applications A stateless application distinguishes itself from standard applications by not storing any data, neither form data nor metadata about instances of the application. The application will also not end up in the user\u0026rsquo;s inbox. A stateless application corresponds to an access service in Altinn 2.\nStateless applications work well as access services where an end-user or a system queries a resource or presents data from a third party based on who the user is. It is also possible to configure a stateless application to allow anonymous users, that is, users who are not logged in.\nConfiguration You can manage the application\u0026rsquo;s behavior during startup and set it up as a stateless application if needed by configuring its application metadata, which is stored in applicationmetadata.json.\nExample of configuration:\nApp/config/applicationmetadata.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd/stateless-app-demo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;org\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stateless App Demo\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataTypes\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ref-data-as-pdf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/pdf\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 0 }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stateless-model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;appLogic\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;autoCreate\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;classRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn.App.Models.StatelessV1\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 1 } ], ... \u0026#34;onEntry\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;show\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;stateless\u0026#34; } // add this line } In the onEntry.show field, you have the opportunity to specify a layout set that you want to display during application startup.\nThe layout set itself is defined in the configuration file App/ui/layout-sets.json. If the file does not exist, you can create it. You can find more information about layout sets here.\nExample of layout set:\nApp/ui/layout-sets.json { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout-sets.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sets\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;stateless\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stateless-model\u0026#34; } ] } In the example above, the layout-set stateless is referring to the datamodel Stateless-model.\nExample of an app structure for an application which is set up in this way:\n├───App ├───config ├───logic ├───models │ Stateless-model.cs │ Stateless-model.metadata.json │ Stateless-model.schema.json │ Stateless-model.xsd ├───ui │ layout-sets.json │ └───stateless | RuleConfiguration.json │ RuleHandler.js │ Settings.json │ └───layouts {page}.json {page}.json can be configured the same way as any normal application page, and will support all components with the exception of:\nFile upload Button The App frontend will read the configuration from applicationmetadata.json and recognize that it should not create an instance. Instead, it will retrieve the layout files and associated data models and present them to the end user.\nConfiguring access without login Note! Form components that affect process (Button for submission or instantiation) are not supported for anonymous users!\nNote: To make use of this functionality you must use version \u0026gt;= 5.1.0 of the nuget-packages Altinn.App.PlatformServices, Altinn.App.Common and Altinn.App.Api.\nTo permit use of an app by a user that is not logged in, you must follow the steps that are described above. You also have to define the data type which is used by the stateless app to allow anonymous use. This is done by modifying the dataType-element in applicationMetadata.json. The data type\u0026rsquo;s appLogic-object needs a new setting, \u0026quot;allowAnonymousOnStateless\u0026quot;: true. See example below:\nApp/config/applicationmetadata.json { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd/stateless-app-demo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;org\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stateless App Demo\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataTypes\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ref-data-as-pdf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/pdf\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 0 }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stateless-model\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;appLogic\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;autoCreate\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;classRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn.App.Models.StatelessV1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowAnonymousOnStateless\u0026#34;: true }, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 1 } ], ... \u0026#34;onEntry\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;show\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;stateless\u0026#34; } } Populating data When using a stateless data type you will be able to populate the data model in when the app front-end requests the form data.\nData will be populated in two steps during the initial call from the front-end (GET):\nPrefill Data processing The following updates to the same form data (POST) will then run prefill one more time, but the calculation is triggered. This allows manipulating the data based on the user\u0026rsquo;s input even in stateless application.\nExample of a calculation which populates the data model mentioned in the example above:\npublic async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataRead(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { if (data.GetType() == typeof(StatelessV1)) { StatelessV1 form = (StatelessV1) data; // Here you can do what you want, for ex. an API-call // if your service is supposed to act as an information transparency service form.Fornavn = \u0026#34;Test\u0026#34;; form.Etternavn = \u0026#34;Testesten\u0026#34;; return true } return false; } Authorization with third party solutions Controlling access for stateless applications can be done with standard app-authorization Where by using Altinn roles you define who has access to the service. If you require further securing of your service you can implement logic for authorization of users with third party solutions. This can be an API which is exposed in your organization or an open API from a different provider.\nIn the example below, an API from the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway is used to determine if a company that is represented by a user in Altinn has the necessary licenses to use a service.\nGUI for authorized user GUI for non-authorized user The source code for the example application can be found here (requires account in Altinn Studio).\nFurther down this page we will use the designation user synonymously with an organization represented by a person in Altinn.\nExpand the data model with fields for authorization\nIn addition to a field for user input and a field to display the result, in this example we have a field for holding information about if the user is authenticated and a field for holding a dynamic error message.\n\u0026lt;xs:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element name=\u0026#34;searchString\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xs:string\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element name=\u0026#34;result\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xs:string\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element name=\u0026#34;userAuthorized\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xs:boolean\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element name=\u0026#34;errorMessage\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xs:string\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:sequence\u0026gt; Skip to step 4 if the application will only be used via an API.\nAdd a field to display error messages in the user interface\nThere are three components to the user interface of an application. A search field for user input, a text field dedicated to showing a search result and a paragraph which is reserved for error messages.\nGUI in Altinn Studio The components are connected to a data model and text resource in the following way in {page}.json:\nApp/ui/layouts/{page}.json \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sokeBoks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SearchString\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;searchString\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: false }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;resultatBoks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TextArea\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Result\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;result\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: true }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;errorBoks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Paragraph\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ErrorMessage\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: true } ] Add dynamic rules to show/hide fields\nWe use dynamic rules to show/hide fields depending on the users level of authorization\nThere has been added a dynamic rule in RuleHandler.js which checks if a field in the datamodel has the value false. Configuration of rules is described more closely here.\nIn RuleConfiguration.json you can see how the rule is utilized. If the input value from the data model userAuthorized is false, the errorBox-component will be made visible, while the opposite happens to the search and result fields as those are hidden.\nDefault behaviour will be the opposite, that search and results are visible while the error field is hidden.\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ruleConnection\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;conditionalRendering\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;e2dd8ff0-f8f1-11eb-b2bc-5b40a942c260\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;selectedFunction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;isFalse\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inputParams\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;userAuthorized\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;selectedAction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Show\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selectedFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;e2dd68e0-f8f1-11eb-b2bc-5b40a942c260\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;errorBoks\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;e2dd8ff0-f8f1-11eb-b2bc-5b40a942c261\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;selectedFunction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;isFalse\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inputParams\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;userAuthorized\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;selectedAction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hide\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selectedFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;e2dd68e0-f8f1-11eb-b2bc-5b40a942c261\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sokeBoks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;e2dd68e0-f8f1-11eb-b2bc-5b40a942c262\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;resultatBoks\u0026#34; } } } } } Add text resources\nIn addition to the name of the service, three text resources have been added.\nThe text resource for error messages contains a placeholder for the name of the user. The variable errorMessage will be populated in the data model when it is registered that the user lacks the authorization to access the service.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ErrorMessage\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{0} mangler rettigheter til å bruke denne tjenesten.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variables\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;errorMessage\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.lookup\u0026#34; } ] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Result\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Resultat\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SearchString\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Legg inn søkeord her:\u0026#34; }, Implement authorization logic\nAll data processing for stateless applications is located in the file App\\logic\\DataProcessing\\DataProcessingHandler.cs, and it is also where the authorization logic should be placed.\nLogic for looking up data and authorizing the user is handled in the method ProcessDataRead. It is called every time a user opens the application or inputs any data.\npublic async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataRead(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { lookup lookup = (lookup)data; // Check if user is authorized to use service Party party = await _register.GetParty(int.Parse(instance.InstanceOwner.PartyId)); if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(party.OrgNumber) || !await _finanstilsynet.HasReqiuiredLicence(_settings.LicenseCode, party.OrgNumber)) { lookup.userAuthorized = false; lookup.errorMessage = $\u0026#34;{party.Name}\u0026#34;; return true; } // logic for looking up data if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(lookup.searchString)) { lookup.result = $\u0026#34;You typed \\\u0026#34;{lookup.searchString}\\\u0026#34;. This is the result.\u0026#34;; return true; } return false; } The method starts with logic for collecting form data for future use in the method.\nlookup lookup = (lookup)data Then comes the logic for checking if the user is authorized.\n// Check if user is authorized to use service Party party = await _register.GetParty(int.Parse(instance.InstanceOwner.PartyId)) if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(party.OrgNumber) || !await _finanstilsynet.HasReqiuiredLicence(_settings.LicenseCode, party.OrgNumber)) { lookup.userAuthorized = false; lookup.errorMessage = $\u0026#34;{party.Name}\u0026#34;; return true; } To know the identity of the user, the identifier instance.InstanceOwner.PartyId is used, this is used as an input for the method. We use Altinns register to collect the party-object which represents the user. It can contain either an organization or a person.\nParty party = await _register.GetParty(int.Parse(instance.InstanceOwner.PartyId)) Two checks are done to decide the authorization of a user. First it is verified that the party object has a defined organization number, if this is not the case and the user is not representing an organization they are not authorized.\nThe other check calls _finanstilsynet.HasReqiuiredLicence(), a method which looks up the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway\u0026rsquo;s API to decide if an organization has been given a license. The implementation of that service is available [here]her.\nIf none of the checks are successful two fields in the data model are populated; - an indicator that the user is not authorized - an error message, with only the name of the user And `true` is returned to indicate that the data values have been updated. ```cs lookup.userAuthorized = false; lookup.errorMessage = $\u0026quot;{party.Name}\u0026quot;; return true; ``` Finally the logic to display the results based on the query string. ```cs // logic for looking up data if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(lookup.searchString)) { lookup.result = $\u0026quot;You typed \\\u0026quot;{lookup.searchString}\\\u0026quot;. This is the result.\u0026quot;; return true; } return false; ``` `lookup.result` is populated with the value from the lookup, in this case we just write the query string back to the user. Again, `true` is returned to indicate that a data value has been changed, and `false` if this is not the case. Starting an instance from a stateless form This is brand new functionality. Setup must be completed manually until further notice and will not be supported in Altinn Studio.\nNote: To make use of this functionality you must use version \u0026gt;= 4.17.2 of the nuget-packages Altinn.App.PlatformServices, Altinn.App.Common og Altinn.App.Api.\nIn a stateless application you have the opportunity to use the InstantiationButton component to start an instance. Currently we only support starting an instance from within the same application the stateless form is displayed in. Starting an instance in another application is functionality we will add in the future.\nThere is an example stateless application where the end user can choose to start an instance in the actual application. It can be used as inspiration for further development. The application with source code can be found here\nInstantiation with prefill An example use case for starting an instance from a stateless application could be an app where the user is presented some given data at first. From this information the user can choose to act on the listed data, and then continue using the service as a normal form.\nTo achieve this type of flow you are dependent on setting up your application as a stateless application, described under configuration. When this has been done, you can expand the stateless view to include InstantiationButton which can start a new instance when the user clicks the button. Standard behaviour for this button is to submit the entire data model that the user has used as a part of the instantiation under the field prefill. If one wishes to pick parts of the data model which are connected in the stateless step it will also be possible to add mappingto the InstantiationButton component. For example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;instantiation-button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;InstantiationButton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Start instans\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;mapping\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;some.source.field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;some.other.field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;id\u0026#34; } } When the user then chooses to start an instance the app frontend will gather the fields some.source.field and some.other.field from the data model in the stateless step and map these fields to name and id which are sent with the instantiation call for the application. Example request which will be sent to the backend which can be mapped to the data model used in the submit part of the application:\n{ \u0026#34;prefill\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ola Nordmann\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12345\u0026#34; }, ... } This prefill value can then be used in the method DataCreation in InstantiationHandler.cs to map against the fields that are needed as a part of the submitting part of the application during instantiation. Example:\npublic async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { if (data.GetType() == typeof(MessageV1)) { string name = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; string id = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; if (prefill.ContainsKey(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;)) { name = prefill[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;]; } if (prefill.ContainsKey(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;)) { id = prefill[\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;]; } MessageV1 skjema = (MessageV1)data; skjema.Sender = name; skjema.Reference = id; } await Task.CompletedTask; } Instantiating from a repeating group If in the stateless step wanted the user to, for example, pick an element from a repeating group to continue on the chosen element, you can set up the InstantiationButton component as a part of the repeating group. Here you can then configure the instantiation button to map fields from the given index the user chose to start an instance from. This requires setting up mapping fields with an index on the actual group. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;instantiation-button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;InstantiationButton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Start ny instans\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;mapping\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;people[{0}].name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;people[{0}].age\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;age\u0026#34; } } In the repeating group {0} will be replaced with the actual index of the group the user wishes to start from.\n"

	"description": "Configuring settings for deployment and runtime behavior",
	"content": "Helm Chart Altinn applications are published to a Kubernetes cluster using a deployment Helm chart. A Helm chart contains the necessary resources to publish an app, including YAML configuration files.\nBased on tests and experiences, we have set some default values in a central Helm chart as a starting point for publishing Altinn applications. These values may change as we gain more experience.\nStarting from version 2.0.0 of the \u0026lsquo;deployment Helm chart,\u0026rsquo; autoscaling is available and enabled by default. Custom settings Custom settings are configured in the App/deployment/values.yaml file by adding the desired property under the deployment section. These will override corresponding settings in the Helm chart (for exceptions, see here). See Initial Scaling for an example.\nPlease note that the format in values.yaml in the central Helm chart differs slightly from values.yaml in the application; in the Helm chart, the properties are at the top level, while in the app, they must be placed under the deployment section. Scaling Initial scaling The initial scaling is defined by replicaCount. If autoscaling is enabled, the autoscaler will override this value.\nStandard settings in the Helm chart:\naltinn-studio-charts/charts/deployment/values.yaml replicaCount: 2 ... To override the settings in your app, you can add replicaCount under deployment i App/deployment/values.yaml:\nApp/deployment/values.yaml deployment: replicaCount: 3 ... Autoscaling When configuring how autoscaling behaves, you need to consider the following sections:\nresources: Guarantees and limits for CPU and memory for app pods during runtime. See Resource Configuration. autoscaling: Settings for when the application should scale up or down. Autoscaling utilizes the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to automatically scale an app up and down based on CPU usage.\nThe autoscaling section configures when an application should automatically scale.\nDefault settings in the Helm chart:\naltinn-studio-charts/charts/deployment/values.yaml ... autoscaling: enabled: true replicas: min: 2 max: 10 avgCpuUtilization: 70 behavior: stabilizationWindowSeconds: scaleUp: 0 scaleDown: 120 ... autoscaling.replicas min: The lowest number of pods the autoscaler is allowed to scale down to. max: The highest number of pods the autoscaler is allowed to scale up to. autoscaling.avgCpuUtilization avgCpuUtilization sets the threshold for the percentage of CPU requests utilized before scaling up or down.\nScaling up is not immediate, as a new pod takes time to start (1-2 minutes in most cases). If all resources in a cluster are reserved, a new node must be started in Azure (5-10 minutes in most cases). It is, therefore, wise to have a small buffer so that the application can handle the load until the capacity is expanded.\nautoscaling.behavior.stabilizationWindowSeconds The stabilization window limits the flickering of replicas when the values used for scaling vary.\nscaleUp: The number of seconds Kubernetes should wait after the last scaling before performing a new scaling-up evaluation. scaleDown: The number of seconds Kubernetes should wait after the last scaling before it performs a new evaluation for scaling down. With standard settings, scaling up will happen once the consumption exceeds the threshold values. Scaling down will wait for two minutes.\nResources configuration The ideal settings for resources depend on the application\u0026rsquo;s code and tasks. We have tried to set default values that should work for as many of the apps in Altinn as possible, but they may not be suitable for your app.\nDefault values in the Helm chart:\naltinn-studio-charts/charts/deployment/values.yaml ... resources: requests: cpu: 300m memory: 256Mi ... Values that are possible to configure (the values below are just an example and by no means definitive):\nApp/deployment/values.yaml deployment: resources: requests: cpu: 200m memory: 256Mi limits: cpu: 1000m memory: 512Mi ... deployment.resources.requests The requests property defines the resources reserved for each pod in the app and are used when the Kubernetes scheduler determines which node the pod should run on. Based on these settings, the maximum number of pods that can run on a node is calculated. The maximum number is limited by the setting allowing the fewest pods.\nVis/skjul innhold Example Given a cluster with nodes, each having 2 cores (2000 milliCores) and 4Gi memory, and where all pods have requests set to 200m (200 milliCores) and 256Mi:\nBased on CPU requests, the number of pods that can run on each node is: 2000 / 200 = 10 Based on memory requests, the number of pods that can run on each node is: 4096Mi / 256Mi = 16 The maximum number of pods that can run on each node, with or without load in the solution, is 10.\nrequests are also used by the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to determine whether the app should scale up or down.\nThe requests settings do not limit how much CPU or memory an application can use if there are available resources. However, a pod may be \u0026ldquo;evicted\u0026rdquo; from the node if there are few available resources and the pod uses more than specified in requests.\ndeployment.resources.limits limits define how much of a resource a pod can use at most.\nIf a pod tries to use more CPU than what is set as a limit, it will be throttled.\nIf a pod attempts to allocate more memory than what is set as a limit, it will be terminated with an Out Of Memory (OOM) error.\nLinkerd By default, all services are add to the Linkerd service mesh:\naltinn-studio-charts/charts/deployment/values.yaml ... linkerd: enabled: true ... We strongly recommend not changing this setting as it adds mutual TLS and other security features to all communication between services in the cluster. Mounting of volumes volumes and volumeMounts define volumes mounted to the application\u0026rsquo;s filesystem. Volumes describe the content of the mounted resource, and volumeMounts specify where in the application\u0026rsquo;s filesystem the content should be mounted.\nThere are two predefined mounted resources and mounting points in the Helm chart that are necessary for standard functionality, including communication with the Altinn Platform:\naltinn-studio-charts/charts/deployment/values.yaml ... volumeMounts: - name: datakeys mountPath: /mnt/keys - name: accesstoken mountPath: \u0026#34;/accesstoken\u0026#34; volumes: - name : datakeys persistentVolumeClaim: claimName: keys - name: accesstoken secret: secretName: accesstoken ... Custom volumes can be added under the development section in App/deployment/values.yaml.\nAt the moment, there is only one use case for adding other volumes: Fetching secrets from Azure Key Vault.\nService The service configuration defines which port is exposed internally in the cluster and which external port it should be mapped to.\nDefault settings in the Helm chart:\n... service: name: deployment type: ClusterIP externalPort: 80 ## If your application is running on another port, change only the internal port. internalPort: 5005 ... If your application is running on a different port than 5005, you can configure deployment.service.internalPort in the application\u0026rsquo;s values.yaml file:\ndeployment: ... service: internalPort: 5007 ... Note: Settings for externalPort must not be changed. Settings overridden at deploy time image ingressRoute These settings are overridden during publishing, so changes here will have no effect.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "When it comes to authentication, there are some configurations that may be relevant",
	"content": "The apps APIs are access-controlled using Altinn Authorization. Requests to the APIs are authorized using the following information:\nAltinnStudioRuntime cookie Authorization header Login Methods Altinn Authorization supports different types of users, which is important to consider when developing custom functionality in an app.\nUsers Can log in via the Altinn Portal or through an external ID-porten session Have User ID, Party ID, and user profile. Authentication level is always greater than 0 Can represent other parties through party selection ID-porten token must be exchanged for an Altinn token via Altinn Authorization Organization Clients authenticated via Maskinporten Applies to organizations with an agreement and access to Maskinporten Maskinporten token must be exchanged for an Altinn token Cannot be used for much in an Altinn app, as organizations are not valid submitters (an organization cannot submit on behalf of itself) Service owner Clients authenticated via Maskinporten Applies to organizations registered as service owners in Altinn (and owners of the running app), who have also requested a service owner scope when authenticating in Maskinporten (altinn:serviceowner) Maskinporten token must be exchanged for an Altinn token Service owner is not a valid submitter, but depending on the XACML policy, service owners can start new instances and modify data in existing instances System user Clients authenticated via Maskinporten A system user is owned by an organization that is a customer/user of a supplier system. The system user is owned by the customer, while the system is owned by the supplier The supplier owns the Maskinporten client and authenticates. This allows the system to impersonate the system user (including rights the system user has been delegated from the customer) The apps API only accepts Maskinporten tokens that have been exchanged for an Altinn token (in the future, we will support Maskinporten tokens directly) Enterprise users from Altinn 2 are only partially supported in Altinn 3. Authentication and authorization will work, but there may be limitations in other parts of the platform. Enterprise users are classified as Organization from the list above. There is no built-in restriction for these users, so if you want to block requests from enterprise users in your app, this must be done manually. This can, for example, be achieved using ASP.NET Core middleware. Information in the app The Altinn.App.Core library provides abstractions for retrieving information about the logged-in user. By default, there are no restrictions on which user types an app accepts, but you can enforce such restrictions yourself in middleware or a validator. Before version v8.6 of the app libraries, it was common to, for example, retrieve the user ID directly from HttpContext, but this could yield unexpected results if the incoming request was authenticated as a system user.\nFrom version v8.6 of Altinn.App.Core, the IAuthenticationContext and Authenticated types are available:\nnamespace Altinn.App.Core.Features.Auth; public interface IAuthenticationContext { Authenticated Current { get; } } ... public abstract class Authenticated { public sealed class User : Authenticated { ... } public sealed class SelfIdentifiedUser : Authenticated { ... } public sealed class Org : Authenticated { ... } public sealed class ServiceOwner : Authenticated { ... } public sealed class SystemUser : Authenticated { ... } } The IAuthenticationContext interface can be used in custom code to check what type of user is logged in, and what information is associated with them.\nLimit access Apps have different requirements for access. In some cases, you may want to restrict the use to specific authentication methods. There is currently no built-in configuration to restrict access based on authentication methods in an app, but this is being considered.\nIAuthenticationContext.Current uses information about the logged-in user from ASP.NET Core\u0026rsquo;s authentication stack. This means that the ASP.NET Core auth middleware must have run for you to get the correct information. Auth middleware is added in UseAltinnAppCommonConfiguration. So if you want to access IAuthenticationContext.Current in an ASP.NET Core middleware, it must be added after UseAltinnAppCommonConfiguration has been called. All interfaces implemented in an app, such as IInstantiationValidator in the example below, run at a time when authentication information is available, so it is completely safe there. ✅ Altinn portal-users Here is an example implementation of IInstantiationValidator that only allows instantiation by users logged in via the Altinn portal:\nusing System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Features.Auth; using Altinn.App.Core.Models.Validation; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.Core; internal sealed class ValidateInstantiation(IAuthenticationContext authenticationContext) : IInstantiationValidator { public Task\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult?\u0026gt; Validate(Instance instance) { var authenticated = authenticationContext.Current; switch (authenticated) { case Authenticated.User user: if (!user.InAltinnPortal) { return Task.FromResult\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult?\u0026gt;( new() { Message = \u0026#34;You must be logged in to the Altinn portal to create a new instance\u0026#34;, Valid = false, } ); } return Task.FromResult\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult?\u0026gt;(null); default: return Task.FromResult\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult?\u0026gt;( new() { Message = \u0026#34;This app only supports user logins via the Altinn portal\u0026#34;, Valid = false, } ); } } } The same authorization can be enforced globally using ASP.NET Core middleware:\nNote that this approach will also block unauthenticated requests. WebApplication app = builder.Build(); ... app.UseAltinnAppCommonConfiguration(); app.Use( async (context, next) =\u0026gt; { var authenticationContext = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService\u0026lt;IAuthenticationContext\u0026gt;(); var authenticated = authenticationContext.Current; if (authenticated is not Authenticated.User { InAltinnPortal: true }) { context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status403Forbidden; await context.Response.WriteAsJsonAsync( new ProblemDetails { Title = \u0026#34;Forbidden\u0026#34;, Detail = \u0026#34;This app only supports users in the Altinn portal\u0026#34;, Status = StatusCodes.Status403Forbidden } ); return; } await next(context); } ); ✅ System users In this example, we only allow requests from system users:\nNote that this approach will also block unauthenticated requests. WebApplication app = builder.Build(); ... app.UseAltinnAppCommonConfiguration(); app.Use( async (context, next) =\u0026gt; { var authenticationContext = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService\u0026lt;IAuthenticationContext\u0026gt;(); var authenticated = authenticationContext.Current; if (authenticated is not Authenticated.SystemUser) { context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status403Forbidden; await context.Response.WriteAsJsonAsync( new ProblemDetails { Title = \u0026#34;Forbidden\u0026#34;, Detail = \u0026#34;This app can only be used as a system user\u0026#34;, Status = StatusCodes.Status403Forbidden } ); return; } await next(context); } ); ❌ Enterprise users In this example, we block the deprecated enterprise users from Altinn 2:\nThese tokens may exist until Altinn 2 is fully phased out. WebApplication app = builder.Build(); ... app.UseAltinnAppCommonConfiguration(); app.Use( async (context, next) =\u0026gt; { var authenticationContext = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService\u0026lt;IAuthenticationContext\u0026gt;(); var authenticated = authenticationContext.Current; if (authenticated is Authenticated.Org) { context.Response.StatusCode = StatusCodes.Status403Forbidden; await context.Response.WriteAsJsonAsync( new ProblemDetails { Title = \u0026#34;Forbidden\u0026#34;, Detail = \u0026#34;Enterprise users are not allowed in this app\u0026#34;, Status = StatusCodes.Status403Forbidden } ); return; } await next(context); } ); "

	"content": "During application development, you will need to work both in Altinn Studio and in a local development environment. Here\u0026rsquo;s an overview of how to get started with local development.\nHow to clone the application to a local development environment Find the application you want to work with locally in the Dashboard in Altinn Studio. Navigate to the repository by clicking the Repository button. Copy the repository link (the blue square) either manually or by clicking the button marked with a red circle. Open a terminal in your local development environment. Navigate to the desired location for the application repository. Enter the command git clone and paste the URL you copied in the previous step. $ git clone https://altinn.studio/repos/\u0026lt;org\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;app-name\u0026gt;.git If you have logged into Altinn Studio without creating a password (e.g. using Github login), you can create a personal access token in Gitea that can be used as a password when cloning: $ git clone https://\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;access-token\u0026gt;@altinn.studio/repos/\u0026lt;org\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;app-name\u0026gt;.git You should see an output in the terminal similar to this: Cloning into \u0026#39;app-name\u0026#39;... remote: Enumerating objects: 982, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (982/982), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (950/950), done. remote: Total 982 (delta 600), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 Receiving objects: 100% (982/982), 166.38 KiB | 1.51 MiB/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (600/600), done. A folder with the same name as the application has been created, and the contents of the application repository have been cloned into the folder. Now you can open your preferred development tool and start coding.\nHow to synchronize changes in the local development environment Changes made locally need to be uploaded (pushed) to the repository from which the code was cloned. If changes are made in Altinn Studio Designer (and uploaded to the repository), these must be downloaded (pulled) to update the local code.\nSynchronizing changes made in the local development environment can be done in several ways. Many development tools have good integrations for this purpose, so check if your tool has that type of support.\nBelow is a description of how you can synchronize changes from the command line.\nUploading changes Navigate to your application repository in a terminal. Add the files you want to upload changes for (push) with the command git add \u0026lt;file path\u0026gt;. The command can be executed for individual files, multiple files at once (space separated), or a directory. Save (commit) the changes with a meaningful message using the command git commit -m \u0026lt;commit message\u0026gt;. Upload (push) the changes to the master branch with the command git push. Downloading changes Navigate to your application repository in a terminal and run the command git pull.\nRead more about git pull here\nHow to synchronize changes in Altinn Studio If you\u0026rsquo;re using Altinn Studio for development, changes need to be synchronized with the Altinn Repository.\nDownloading changes Click on Hent endringer (Fetch changes) on the \u0026lsquo;Lage\u0026rsquo; page of the application in Altinn Studio. If everything went well, you will see this confirmation. Uploading changes Click on Last opp dine endringer (Upload your changes) on the \u0026lsquo;Lage\u0026rsquo; page of the application in Altinn Studio. Enter a descriptive message for the change(s) and click Valider endringer (Validate changes). Wait for the changes to be validated. If a conflict occurs, click Løs konflikt (Resolve conflict) and follow the instructions. Click lagre (Save) to upload the changes to the repository (master). If everything went well, you will see this confirmation. Local testing When working locally, it can be useful to preview the changes you make. LocalTest is a program that spins up a local mock-up of the Altinn Platform. This allows you to test and verify local changes without having to synchronize with Altinn Studio.\nNOTE To run the app in LocalTest, the application must have an associated data model. Download and start LocalTest by following the steps described on GitHub (includes starting the app, which is also explained below). Run your application within LocalTest: Open a new terminal window and navigate to the subfolder App in your application (\u0026lt;app-name\u0026gt;/App). Start the app with the command dotnet run and wait for confirmation in the terminal. Preview and test application: Go to http://local.altinn.cloud and log in with a test user. Preview changes in real-time For changes related to JSON files, simply reload the page. For changes in prefilling, the application must be instantiated again (go to http://local.altinn.cloud and log back in). For changes in CS files, the application must be stopped (ctrl+C) and restarted (dotnet run). To automatically update when there are changes in CS files, start the application with dotnet watch. This command will either start the application or reload it (hot reload) when changes are made to the source code.\nStopping the application and LocalTest To stop the application, press ctrl+C in the terminal window where you started it. To stop LocalTest, navigate to the app-localtest folder in the terminal and run the command docker compose down.\n"

	"content": "Configuration of OpenTelemetry (OTel) requires minimum version 8 of the Altinn.App libraries. The existing Application Insights SDK setup is obsolete and will be removed in version 9. Configuring your app The new monitoring and instrumentation setup based on OpenTelemetry is enabled simply by setting UseOpenTelemetry to true in appsettings.json or equivalent.\n{ \u0026#34;AppSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;UseOpenTelemetry\u0026#34;: true } } You can now run the app, and the Altinn.App library will by default ship telemetry to localtest when running locally, and to Azure monitor when running in an environment.\nRead more about configuration options on the configuration reference page.\nCustom instrumentation The most straightforward way of getting familiar with the Altinn.App instrumentation APIs is by creating a simple IHostedService implemented in Program.cs. This way we can get some code running which we can experiment with. An IHostedService that is registered with AddHostedService will ensure that its\u0026rsquo; StartAsync is invoked during startup for the process/container. The goal of this example is to get acquainted with the telemetry API and monitoring solution. In practice, we will get a counter that increments by 1 when the app starts, and a trace containing a child-span and a related log-message.\nWe recommend experimenting more with this example - add different types of metric, add attributes to traces etc.\nThe telemetry and instrumentation APIs of the Altinn.App library are exposed through the Telemetry class. It is a thread-safe singleton object available in the dependency injection container. Let\u0026rsquo;s extend the the app by extending Program.cs.\nIf they\u0026rsquo;re not there already, we need the following using statements at the top of the file:\nusing System; using System.Threading; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; Then we can implement the following class in the bottom of the file:\nsealed class StartupService(ILogger\u0026lt;StartupService\u0026gt; logger, Telemetry telemetry) : IHostedService { public async Task StartAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) { // Create a custom metric - a counter in this case. Name will become `altinn_app_started` var counter = telemetry.Meter.CreateCounter\u0026lt;long\u0026gt;(Telemetry.Metrics.CreateName(\u0026#34;started\u0026#34;)); // Increments the counter counter.Add(1); // Start an activity, which gets emitted as an OTel span using var activity = telemetry.ActivitySource.StartActivity(\u0026#34;StartupService\u0026#34;); { // Wait a little, then spawn a child activity/span await Task.Delay(100, cancellationToken); using var childActivity = telemetry.ActivitySource.StartActivity(\u0026#34;ChildActivity\u0026#34;); await Task.Delay(100, cancellationToken); } // Logs come from the `ILogger\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;` interface var now = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow; logger.LogInformation(\u0026#34;StartupService logging - Now={Now}\u0026#34;, now); } public Task StopAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken) =\u0026gt; Task.CompletedTask; } Now we can register this class in the .NET dependency injection container, which will ensure that StartAsync is called when the process starts up.\nvoid RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { services.AddHostedService\u0026lt;StartupService\u0026gt;(); } Now you can run the app. Below in the next section we will take a look at visualisation of the telemetry above.\nYou can also read more about instrumentation on the instrumentation reference page.\nVisualisation Here is a brief overview of visualising the telemetry instrumented above.\nRunning locally When running locally using localtest, a monitoring stack consisting of Grafana and OpenTelemetry Collector can be provisioned along side localtest and Platform APIs. See the localtest README for more info.\nLocaltest monitoring setup currently contains a Grafana instance with ASP.NET Core dashboards and a preview Altinn app dashboard. In addition to these, you can freely explore the emitted telemetry while debugging or learning how the Altinn platform and libraries works.\nNote that the telemetry from platform services in localtest are different from when the app runs in other environments. This is because the platform services that are running locally have differences in code and configuration.\nRead more about local Grafana on the visualisation reference page.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve implemented the code above, you should be able to find the altinn_app_started metric in the explore tab for the Metrics datasource. You should also be able to find the log message and trace emitted above by using the other datasources.\nTo open Grafana, visit local.altinn.cloud/grafana/, then click explore in the side-menu.\nFirst, let\u0026rsquo;s explore metrics by navigation to the Explore tab and selecting Metrics as source in the dropdown menu. Here we can choose which metric to view in the Select a metric section: Explore metrics To view traces, we choose Traces as the source, while still in the Explore tab. We select our app name as the Service Name. Now we can see traces in the Table view. We click on a trace ID to see the full trace in a new pop-up to the right.\nExplore traces. Here it is possible to analyze traces, attributes, and filter out log messages related to the trace. By clicking the Logs for this span-button we can navigate to the relevant log view for this span. A query will be generated for us, as seen below. Note that the source is changed from Traces to Logs and that we can easily navigate back.\nExplore logs. Now we see all log messages related to the root trace we made. Deploying to an environment When the app is deployed to an environment, the telemetry is currently shipped to Azure Monitor.\nRead more about Azure Monitor on the visualisation reference page.\nIn Azure Monitor, logs and traces can be found by using the Transaction search menu blade, while metrics are in the Metrics menu blade.\nIn the future, the Altinn monitoring solution for deployed apps will also be based on Grafana.

	"content": " This is a description of how to set up a payment task in the app process. This involves several manual steps in multiple configuration files. If you use Altinn Studio Designer to add the payment task to the process, all the manual configuration outlined below will be set up automatically.\nCreate two data types to store payment information: This data type is used to store information and status about the payment. Put it in the dataTypes array in App/config/applicationmetadata.json.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;paymentInformation\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;allowedContributors\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;app:owned\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 0, } This data type is used to store the PDF-receipt for the payment. Configure it next to the other data type.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;paymentReceiptPdf\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/pdf\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;allowedContributors\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;app:owned\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 0, } It is important to set allowedContributors to \u0026quot;app:owned\u0026quot;. This ensures that these data items cannot be edited via the app’s API but only by the app itself. Before version 8.6, this was misspelled allowedContributers.\nThe IDs can be set to something else, but they must match the IDs entered in paymentDataType and paymentReceiptPdfDataType in the process step, as shown in step 2.\nExtend the app process with payment task: A process step and a gateway must be added to App/config/process/process.bpmn, as in the example below.\nPayment uses three user actions. If the Altinn user interface is used by the app, these will be called automatically when you are in the payment step. If only the API is used, these must be called manually via the /actions endpoint.\npay: Initiates the payment, often by making API calls to the payment processor.

	"content": "This documentation is a work in progess. Subforms are currently in preview-release. Subforms are contained in a subform table. Let us go through configuring a subform table and the subform contained within.\nCreate a data model for the subform. You should now see the three files under App/model. The c# class, the json schema and the xsd. Set appLogic.allowInSubform to true in applicationMetadata.json. Create a folder under App/ui with your desired subform name. In the subform folder, add a Settings.json file and a folder called layouts. You can add page layouts to the layouts folder as you would for the main form. Subforms do not support attachments, and nesting subforms is not allowed (subform in subform). The Settings.json file for the sub form is configured as normal. The button which closes the subform must be a CustomButton with a closeSubform action. Optionally you can also trigger validation before exiting. { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;subform-exitbutton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CustomButton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;The button title\u0026#34; // Defaults to `general.done` if omitted }, \u0026#34;actions\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ClientAction\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;closeSubform\u0026#34;, // Validation is optional \u0026#34;validation\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;page\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;all\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;show\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;All\u0026#34;] } } ] } Add a layout set to layout-sets.json with the data type of the data model from step 1. Choose your subform folder name as the id. { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;subform-layout-folder-name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your-subform-dataType\u0026#34; } Navigate to the layout for the page in the main form in which you want to add the sub form table.

What you need to implement in your setup is\nContext Handler You would need to write your own context handler functionality that undestand your domain. Meaning it would need to understand what kind of enrichment that is needed. It the simplest scenarious this does not need to do anything if the authorization request contains all information needed by PDP\nPRP You need to implement funcionality to identify the correct XACML Policy. In Altinn we have different policies for the different apps, but in some simple scenarios you would only need to reference a static XACML Policy.\nPIP If context handler need to enrich\n"

Instead of roles, there will be various access packages in Altinn 3 consisting of services that belong to a responsibility area. The access packages will function as templates for access managers in an organization, which they can use to give their employees access to a set of services that naturally belong together. Information about what this entails and which access packages we propose can be found here:\nWe are now sending this proposal for new templates for consultation. We particularly want feedback on:\nwhether the proposed templates fit the services you have the names at all three levels of the templates Feedback can be sent by email to servicedesk@altinn.no by August 1, 2023.\nThe way forward: When the first version of the new access groups is clarified, service owners must update authorization rules for ALL services that use Altinn as an authorization solution. We expect this must be done in the last quarter of 2023. Guidance material will be developed for this work.\nMore information about the proposal can be found in the attached documents.\n"

The containers will be orchestrated by Kubernetes.\nThe Altinn App is deployed as sets of Docker Containers defined as Kubernetes Deployment. The deployment will be in the organisation\u0026rsquo;s own Kubernetes Cluster.\nAll organisations will have their own Kubernetes Cluster.\nEach set of Kubernetes Deployment will be scaled based on the usage of the app. Scaling of the Deployment will be configurable in the Kubernetes Deployment and automatically scaled using Kubernetes Replicaset.\nKubernetes Clusters and Altinn Apps can do horizontal autoscaling. It is currently not decided if and how autoscaling will be used.\nThe Altinn App in Kubernetes will be configured as a Kubernetes Service which consist of the latest runtime application available when building the Altinn App and the Altinn App with related code and configuration.\nKubernetes Clusters per Organisation In Altinn Apps, every organisation will have their separate Kubernetes Cluster in each environment. The Kubernetes Cluster architecture will be the same in test and production environment This will support scaling tailored each organisations needs and separation of each organisation\u0026rsquo;s app.\nSecrets Pods, where the Altinn App are delpoyed, gets access to secrets during deployment via HELM charts.\nKubernetes Namespace It\u0026rsquo;s not planned to use namespaces.\nKubernetes Service Each Altinn App will be a Kubernetes Service.\nNetworking Sub domains Each organisation will have their own sub domain \u0026lt;org\u0026gt;.apps.altinn.no.\nPath for the Altinn App \u0026lt;org\u0026gt;.apps.altinn.no/\u0026lt;app\u0026gt;\nEncrypted traffic and network policy There is ongoing analysis related to this topic. Click here to find more information on Github.\nRouting / Ingress-Controller Routing in Kubernetes is handled by an Ingress-Controller called Traefik.\nTo be able to route traffic to the correct Kubernetes Service (Altinn App), each container is tagged to a specific Altinn App. The routing mecahnism routes to the correct Kubernetes Service based on the url containing the Altinn App parameter.\nAPI Proxy API Proxy is needed for controlling credentials and outbound firewall rules from the platform. This might be handled by the API Managment software. Needs Analyzis\nAPI Management The platform requires API management software to handle SLA ++.

Docker Pull: Microsoft/DotNet AspNetCore. Copy Altinn Runtime, AltinnApp Build files and App Metadata/Resources from Gitea. Publish to ACR. The build and deploy app pipeline is controlled by different flags :\nAPP_COMMIT_ID - used as id for the app image and should be used to reference the repository at that commit state APP_DEPLOY_TOKEN - used to identify user when cloning repository (is only really necessary for private repositorys but is mandetory) APP_ENVIRONMENT - represent which environment to deploy to (not yet used) APP_OWNER - the owner of the repository APP_REPO - the name of the repository to clone and use to create the app GITEA_ENVIRONMENT - the gitea environment to clone the repository from should_build - flag that can be used if one only wishes to deploy a app and not build it (default set to true) should_deploy - flag that can be used if one wishes to deploy an app (default set to false) Triggered by:\n\u0026ldquo;Deploy\u0026rdquo;-button in Altinn Studio. Manual deployment of Altinn App A manual deployment of the Altinn App requires access to you Kubernetes Cluster and knowledge about Helm.\nIf you want to configure the Helm chart and do a manual deployment you can find the Helm chart in your repo in the \u0026ldquo;deployment\u0026rdquo; folder.\nPlatform Cluster The platform cluster in Altinn Studio Apps will host common application like DataServices.\nPlatform integration The platform integration is a new application hosted in the existing infrastructure. It exposes REST-APIs for Profile, Register, Authorization, Intermediary and Authentication. These are services not part of the Altinn Platform (yet) and everyone planning to run the Altinn Platform would need to implement their own components that support.

To set up file uploading components in repeating groups, some additional setup is required.\nWhen uploading file attachments it may be difficult to distinguish which file attachments belongs to which rows in the repeating group, and thus which submitted information belongs to each attachment. Therefore, you must set up connections to the data model when file uploading are used in repeating groups, so that Altinn can fill out the unique identifier that belongs to each file attachment and send this together with the rest of the data in the instance.\nThe ability to place a reference to the file attachment in the data model can also be used outside of repeating groups if you want a reference to a file attachment together with the form data on the receivers end.\nExample on file attachment in repeating group with attached data model The following is an example of a data model expecting a reference to an uploaded file attachment.\n\u0026lt;xsd:schema xmlns:xsd=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\u0026#34; elementFormDefault=\u0026#34;qualified\u0026#34; attributeFormDefault=\u0026#34;unqualified\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:element name=\u0026#34;FamilieMedlemmer\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;Skjema\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:complexType name=\u0026#34;Skjema\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:element name=\u0026#34;FamilyMember\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;FamilyMember\u0026#34; maxOccurs=\u0026#34;99\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:anyAttribute /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:complexType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:complexType name=\u0026#34;FamilyMember\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:element name=\u0026#34;FirstName\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xsd:string\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:element name=\u0026#34;Picture\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xsd:string\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:complexType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:schema\u0026gt; This is connected to the file upload component in the group:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;picture\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;FileUpload\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Picture\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;FamilyMember.Picture\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;maxFileSizeInMB\u0026#34;: 25, \u0026#34;maxNumberOfAttachments\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minNumberOfAttachments\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;displayMode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;simple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true } In cases where it is allowed to upload multiple files to the same file attachment component, use a data model attachment of the type list:\n\u0026lt;xsd:complexType name=\u0026#34;FamilyMember\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:element name=\u0026#34;FirstName\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xsd:string\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:element name=\u0026#34;Pictures\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xsd:string\u0026#34; maxOccurs=\u0026#34;5\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:complexType\u0026gt; { [...] \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;list\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;FamilyMember.Pictures\u0026#34; } } The receiving end will then receive a list of multiple unique ID\u0026rsquo;s, one for each attachment.

The most important is\nNeeds to be supported by different types of application frameworks Needs to support end users accessing Altinn Apps / Altinn Platform through a web browser running the REACT application Needs to be safe against XSS attacks. Needs to support scenarios where users are accessing through external systems or mobile apps Needs to support systems from org(s) that is authorized to perform application operations. Apps should not have access to secret so they can create their own token. Needs to support passing the identity to api\u0026rsquo;s that are consumed by Altinn Apps. Since Altinn Platform will in the future support applications created by different frameworks (Java/.NET/Node.js, ++) it is important that the authentication mechanisms are supported by different types of platforms.\nJSON Web Token are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties and are chosen as the bearer of information about users and systems.\nThe JWTToken is created in an asymmetric process where the Authentication component will use a private key from a certificate to sign the token, and the different apps and components that needs to verify it will use the public key. See JWT Format for details on the algorithm used.\nThe illustration below show how JWT flows between the different parts of the solutions.\nAuthentication Architecture Download as Visio.\nEnd user using app frontend For end user accessing the app through browser that loads app frontend, the authentication mechanism is based on using a protected cookie containing a JWT Token. ( HttpOnly and Secure)\nThe reason for putting the JWT token in the cookie for this scenarious is to protect against XSS attacks.\nIf the REACT application stored the JWT token as part of browser memory (REDUX), XSS attacks could potential expose those tokens. When storing the tokens in secure cookies those tokens are not available to any JavaScript code running in the browser.\nThe cookie with the JWT token is created by Authentication component in the Altinn Platform solution.\nThe React application would need to refresh the token at given interval or the token will expire. To refresh a cookie token, the token API in Platform needs to be called.\nOrg systems accessing app and Platform APIs Org (the entity owning the application) will have seperate API\u0026rsquo;s in a spp to perform operations on. They are authenticated with help of agency system id + password. A API in the authentication component in Altinn creates a JWT token that can be used to authenticate the agency system when calling api\u0026rsquo;s on apps running in Altinn Apps.\nSee Authentication API for details.\nEnd user systems accessing app APIs This solutions is yet to be finalized. The assumption is that the either the organization that own the system is authenticated and have a jwt token containing the organization number for that given organization or that the user using the system is authenticated and the systems send user token with request.\nThis is analyzed in #3291 and #237.\nAuthentication of users in Altinn Apps against Altinn Platform Applications hosted in a Altinn Apps solution would in many cases need to authenticate the end user against the different Altinn Platform components.\nThe solution for this is that the Apps would forward the JWT Token from the bearer token or JWT Cookie to the component that is called. This would be forwarded as a bearer token in the Authorization header in the request against the component.\nThis makes it possible to configure JWTCookie authentication mechanismen to authenticate the end user also in the components.\nAuthentication of Altinn Studio against Altinn Platform To make sure it is only allowed for a Altinn Studio environment to deploy and update applications the calls from designer to platform is authenticated with a access token generated by Designer.\nSee more details in AccessToken.\nAuthentication of Apps and components against Altinn Platform Some components like Register and Profile is limited to be used only by the apps deployed to Altinn Apps or other components in Altinn Platform\nTo be able to enforce this the platform components requires a Access Token identifying the app/component that is calling the Platform component. Each org has their own certificate avaialble in their Kubernetes Cluster.\nThe apps deployed to this cluster has access to this certifcate and generates a JWT token with the needed claims. The platform components has access to the public part of the certificate and are able to validate it.\nSee more details in AccessToken.\nAccess TokenTo protect API that should not be able to be used by other apps or platform components, we have an additional access token.\nAuthentication APIsDescription of the Authentications API in Authentication Component\nJWT FormatDescription of the JWT Format used in Altinn Studio, Altinn Platform and Altinn Apps.\nOIDC ProvidersAltinn Authentication support configuration of multiple OIDC Providers\n"

This API uses API in the SBL Bridge to verify the cookie and get information about the logged-in user.\nBased on this information this API creates a JWT token with claims about the user (userid, authentication level ++) and sign the JWT token with the private key of Altinn Platform.\nThe login process for a user that wants to access an app in Altinn Apps is described below.\nLogin process Download as Visio.\nExchange API for tokens Altinn supports tokens from different ID-providers, and in the future, it is expected that the list of supported ID-providers will grow.\nTo reduce complexity and increase performance the clients need to exchange the external tokens for an Altinn token.\nIn this way, the different apps do not need to know about all ID-providers and are not required to look up org identification or Altinn userId/partyId that is added to the Altinn token.\nExchanging ODIC token from ID-porten Altinn supports end-users logging in with OIDC in their end user system. (local installation or cloud-based).\nThe end-user-system gets an ID-token and a access-token from ID-porten. This is documentet at ID-porten.\nThe access token is exchanged in the API to an Altinn JWT token containing the needed attributes like userId\nExchanging token from MaskinPorten To authenticate a system like this Altinn Platform requires that the system is registered as a client in Maskinporten for a given org. The org needs also to be given scopes that matches the scopes for the API requested in Maskinporten.\nThis will be given by Altinn to the org.\nThe org system should be given the scope needed by the administrator of org. (done through Maskinporten API described here)\nThe org system would need to request a access token from Maskinporten with the correct scope. This token will be used in the org API in Authentication component in the Altinn Platform to create a new JWT token that can be used for all org apis in Apps and platform.\nDuring the verification process of the Maskinporten JWT token the scope and org is verified.\nDuring this process the Maskinporten token is exchanged to a Altinn token containing information about the authenticated org. This increases performance since org information does not need to be looked up for each request and the different apps and platform components would not need to know about all the different ID-providers supported by Altinn.\nThe below sequence diagram show how this will happen:\nLogin process org systems Download as Visio.\n"

Issues of urgent matter (support or development) is handled by Altinn 2 service management organization.\nConsent service With consent/power of attorney, you can request permission to retrieve/share data that the public has about a citizen or business, or carry out something on their behalf. You then get temporary access or action rights to a specific set of information or services from the user. This could, for example, be tax data from the Norwegian Tax Authorities. Read more here\nAccess Control Altinn can be used for authorization and access control for external services, i.e. services on other websites than in the Altinn platform. Altinn Authorization can be used by service owners who want to make information and services available on their own platform and website, but cannot carry out a full authorization of user access. Read more here\nAccess control used in APIs Maskinporten is part of a national trust-service solution Digdir which offers security of API access via machine-to-machine authentication and an OAuth2-scope based authorization mechanism. Altinn makes it possible for businesses that have been given access to an API through Maskinporten to pass this on to, for example, a supplier who will carry out the technical implementation on their behalf. Read more here\nUsers og authentication The team has responsibility of the user types that are available: persons (pnr/dnr), organizations (orgnr), business users, self-identified users, computer system (systemID) Authentication via Portal and in API including integration with IDporten, Maskinporten and Altinn-specific authentication solutionsr\nAltinn 2 copy av ER og FREG Altinn has an updated copy of ER and FREG which are used in various parts of Altinn.\n"

	"description": "The Altinn platform has compelling and flexible authorization capabilities.",
	"content": "The authorization capabilities are based on ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Controls) and use the XACML 3.0 standard.\nThese capabilities include:\nThe capability to define wide/narrow authorization policies for apps. Rules can be valid for the whole application or only for a subset of resources. The capability to evaluate policies based on a request for a resource The capability to configure authorization policies for API endpoints The capability to enforce decision request (permit or deny) The capability to enrich decision requests with needed information The capability to retrieve context information from different sources for subject and resource. The capability to authorize based on API scopes Main Concept The following concepts are important\nAuthorization Components The following solution components provide authorization capabilities\nPAP - Policy Administration Point: Where the authorization policies are defined PDP - Policy Decision Point: Where the authorization request is evaluated PEP - Policy Enforcement Point: The component making sure the user/system is authorized before accessing resources PIP - Policy Information Point: Components giving information to PDP about resources and subjects PRP - Policy Retrieval Point: Where the PDP can find the correct policy to use for a request Context Handler - Component adding context information to the decision request so PDP can evaluate a decision request correctly. These components are described in detail under solution components\nRights In Altinn Apps/Platform a right is permission to act on a given resource. The action performed can be one of some predefined options like read, write and sign but can also be any other action defined on a custom API in the apps. The resource is typical an app instance or part of it where data belongs to a given party (person or organization).\nA user or system gets a right based on rules that describe permissions based on being a specific user or having a specific role.\nPolicy A policy defines one or many rules for a given set of resources. This policy is described as an XACML 3.0 Policy document.\nRule An authorization rule in the Altinn Platform defines who has been given the right to perform actions on a given resource. A rule consists of 5 elements\nResource This describes which resource the rule applies for. Altinn Apps currently supports the following resource types in rules.\nOrg - Unique identifier of the organization responsible for the app. App - Application identifier which is unique within an organization. Task - A specific task in the process defined for an app Appresource - A resource for an instance/app that is not mapped to a task. Example: events Some of the resource types are meant to be used in combination. As an example, you can have been given the right for an app for a given reportee\nSubject The subject in an authorization rule identifies who the rules apply for. In Altinn Apps/Platform the resource can be the following.\nRoleType org When delegating is supported this would be expanded with\nuserid partyid keyroleforpartyid Action The Action part of the rule defines what type of action that the subject can perform on the resource.\nCurrently, the actions relevant for Altinn Apps and Altinn Platform are listed below. This list will increase over time.\nRead Write Sign Confirm Delete Condition The condition part of the rule is extra conditions that need to be fulfilled for the rule to be valid. In Altinn Studio we have the following types of conditions.\nValid To Obligation An obligation is an obligation that needs to be followed if the user is permitted or denied. In Altinn Apps/Platform this is used to define the minimum authentication level.\nCreation of policies The policies in Altinn Studio Apps is defined when the app developer defines the rules for the app. The policy is deployed together with the App to a given Altinn Studio App environment. See details in Policy Administration Point in Altinn Studio.\nIn Altinn II end users can also create policies/rules. This happens when:\nWhen the user creates a local role that contains rights that users have through other roles When delegating single rights to a user or organization. The rules is slightly different since rules defined by the end user have different subjects and can be defined for a more limited resource.\nThis will be supported in Altinn 3. See Github issue 1258\nAltinn Studio policy/rules Rule defined in Altinn Studio User defined policy/rules Rule defined by user Roles Altinn Studio Apps will retrieve roles from Altinn II Administration. This will later could be expanded to other sources for roles.\nScopes API Scopes are used in the solutions in some uses cases where organizations are authenticated through the external ID-Provider \u0026ldquo;MaskinPorten\u0026rdquo; or when end users are accessing the apps through end-user-systems.\nThe scopes are used to control what the user can do on behalf of the user/organization.\nScopes are always used together with the authorization rules for the specific app.\nDefined Scopes altinn:instances.read : Give system the right to access API for reading instances altinn:instances.write : Give system the right to access API for writing to instances altinn:serviceowner/instances.read : Give orgs the right to access API for reading instances altinn:serviceowner/instances.write : Give orgs the right to access API for writing to instances The Future The below show the future of Authorization Component.

The automatic backups are taken without affecting the performance or availability of the database operations. All the backups are stored separately in a storage service, and those backups are globally replicated for resiliency against regional disasters.\nAzure Cosmos DB automatically takes a backup of your database every 4 hours and at any point of time, only the latest 2 backups are stored. However, if the container or database is deleted, Azure Cosmos DB retains the existing snapshots of a given container or database for 30 days.\nCosmos DB This functionality is out of the box when using Azure Cosmos DB.\nThis backup would only be relevant to use if all data is lost from Cosmos DB.\nCustom backup with help of Azure Function To support recovery of single or group of documents we needed to create a custom backup mechanismen.\nFor this we use the change feed that Azure Cosmos DB expose.\nChange feed support in Azure Cosmos DB works by listening to an Azure Cosmos container for any changes. It then outputs the sorted list of documents that were changed in the order in which they were modified. The changes are persisted, can be processed asynchronously and incrementally, and the output can be distributed across one or more consumers for parallel processing.\nChange feed The solution is to have a Azure Function that listens to the change feed\nand copies documents from Cosmos DB when they are created or modified to a blob storage.\nThe blob storage is a shared blob storage for all orgs. (The same way Cosmos DB is shared) The blob storage have enabled soft delete. All versions of a document in Cosmos should be written to the same blob. Soft delete will keep track of all versions.\nThe following collections has a Azure Function that takes backup. Click on name for code details about Azure Function\nApplications DataElements InstanceEvents Instance Texts The below images show how the documents are backed up in a blob storage and soft delete has created a snapshot that last for 90 days. In theese 90 days we are able to recover the document to an earlier version.\nThe containers for the different cosmos DB collections A list of blobs for a given party Details for a document, like when it was created and when last changed A list of snapshots that can be used to restore the document to an earlier version Blob storage Each org has their own separte storage account with a blob storage to store data for applications. In addition Altinn Platform has a shared blobstorge where metedata like XACML is stored for the different Apps.\nTo protect against unwanted deletion or changes we have enabled soft delete.\nWhen enabled, soft delete enables you to save and recover your data when blobs or blob snapshots are deleted. This protection extends to blob data that is erased as the result of an overwrite.\nWhen data is deleted, it transitions to a soft deleted state instead of being permanently erased. When soft delete is on and you overwrite data, a soft deleted snapshot is generated to save the state of the overwritten data.\nFor Altinn we have 90 days retention period. Inside that periode we can recover a blob to an earlier version.\nSee more about soft delete on Azure Documentation.\n"

We recommend updating to latest version which is currently at 1.3.1.\n\u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Api\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.3.1\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Common\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.3.1\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.PlatformServices\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.3.1\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; If there are some breaking changes when updating the nuget-version this should be documented below.\nAdded registration of events to the new Events component The Altinn.App.* packages has been updated to work with the new Events component in Altinn. This is introduced with version 1.1.11-alpha of the packages.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files.\nUpdated package dependencies Navigate to you application repository and find App.csproj in the App folder. Update nuget dependencies in App.csproj to version 1.1.11-alpha or newer..\n\u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Api\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.1.11-alpha\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Common\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.1.11-alpha\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.PlatformServices\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.1.11-alpha\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Changes in Startup.cs:\nservices.AddHttpClient\u0026lt;IEvents, EventsAppSI\u0026gt;(); Startup already have multiple similar lines with calls to AddHttpClient. Add the new line anywhere among them.\nThis will probably also require two new lines at the top of the file:\nusing Altinn.App.PlatformServices.Implementation; using Altinn.App.PlatformServices.Interface; Changes in appsettings.json:\nA new property has been included in called PlatformSettings.ApiEventsEndpoint. The value here is used for local test and will be replaced during deploy to test and production environments.\n\u0026#34;PlatformSettings\u0026#34;: { ... \u0026#34;ApiEventsEndpoint\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://localhost:5101/events/api/v1/\u0026#34; } |``` The default behaviour of the logic is to not send events. To override this there is a new setting called `AppSettings:RegisterEventsWithEventsComponent`. Update the appsettings file by adding an entry in the AppSettings section: ```json \u0026#34;AppSettings\u0026#34;: { ... \u0026#34;RegisterEventsWithEventsComponent\u0026#34;: false } Change the setting to true if the app should create and send events. Please note that the feature is under continued development and still considered experimental.\nSupport for deleting instances from endpoint in app #4871 was fixed with in release of 1.1.10-alpha of the app nugets. This change only affects users and app owners that try to delete an instance.\nErrors 403 response when trying to delete an instance using the endpoint exposed in the application.\nHow to fix If you are not using 1.1.10-alpha or above. Start by upgrading the nuget references in you application. If you are running a newer release, skip to step 2.\nNavigate to you application repository and find App.csproj in the App folder. Update nuget dependencies in App.csproj to version 1.1.10-alpha or newer..\n\u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Api\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.1.10-alpha\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Common\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.1.10-alpha\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.PlatformServices\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.1.10-alpha\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Navigate to you application repository and find Startup.cs in the App folder.

The required rule is documented here .\nUpdate path of Data Protection Keys for Apps #4483 changed the way we use data protection keys in order to improve the support for running locally. These keys are used in XSRF-protection. When you are running apps locally, we are using the default behaviour (directory under current user) for .Net Core. The path is passed with an environment variable when running in an apps cluster. This change requires the deployment.yaml file to be updated with the correct variable.\nThe change affects all application created in Altinn Studio before 30.09.2020 using Altinn.App.PlatformServices 1.1.8-alpha and above\nErrors User may experience errors posting data when the app is restarted or when multiple replicas are used.\nHow to fix You need to add the environment variable in the deployment.yaml file. If you have not done any changes to the file previously, you can copy the file from here, otherwise you need to update the file directly. Both the name of the environment variable and the value must be set as follows:\nenv: - name: ALTINN_KEYS_DIRECTORY value: \u0026#34;/mnt/keys\u0026#34; Deployment.yaml file Build pipeline failed on task: Build and push docker image to acr A namespace was renamed in Altinn.App.PlatformServices Version=\u0026ldquo;1.1.2-alpha causing the build of the application to fail if references to this namespace isn\u0026rsquo;t changed.\nThis affects all applications created before June 2020 that reference nuget versions \u0026gt;= 1.1.2-alpha.\nErrors Build pipeline fails due to failing task: Build and push docker image to acr.\nExpanding the task reveals error message:\nStartup.cs(5,35): error CS0234: The type or namespace name \u0026#39;Extensions\u0026#39; does not exist in the namespace \u0026#39;Altinn.App.PlatformServices\u0026#39; (are you missing an assembly reference?)\u0026#34;.

Deploy pipeline failed to set subscription key Introduced in the newest version of Azure Powershell, which is used during deploy of apps. The change results in the subscription key for the app not being set. The subscription key is needed for the apps to have access to the platform APIs.\nThis only affects apps that were deployed some time within the period July 7th - July 22nd. Apps deployed for the first time to a specific environment are not affected.\nErrors Users will experience that instantiation fails, and only a blue screen is shown. If looking at the network traffic during instantiation, users will see that the call to user fails with code 404.\nHow to fix The deployment pipeline has been updated. Re-deploying the app to the same environment will solve the problem (no need to trigger another build).\nProperty type changed for UserProfile.ProfileSettingPreference Introduced with issue: #4466 and release v2020.28.\nThe change affects all applications in TT02 and PR with nuget version 1.0.98 and lower.\nErrors App doesn\u0026rsquo;t load only the blue background is visible.\nHow to fix Navigate to you application repository and find App.csproj in the App folder.

If no custom changes have been made to this file since you created the application, simply replace the content of the file with this code.\nThe picture illustrates which changes are required in the file if you wish to do it manually, or inspect your code. Be ware that indentation is important when working with .yaml files. add-new-volume-to-values Update nuget dependencies in App.csproj to version 1.0.86-alpha. Navigate to you application repository and find App.csproj in the App folder. Upgrade the three Altinn.App nuget packages to version 1.0.86. \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Api\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.0.86-alpha\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Common\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.0.86-alpha\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.PlatformServices\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;1.0.86-alpha\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Update Startup.cs in the App folder in your application repository. If no custom changes have been made to this file since you created the application, simply replace the content of the file with this code. The picture illustrates which changes are required in the file if you wish to do it manually, or inspect your code. Update Startup.cs Updated client-side validation - frontend v2 and Nuget v1.0.82-alpha Introduced with issue: #3944, and applies to existing apps that upgrade to the new major version of app frontend (v2).\nThe client-side validation of the app frontend has been replaced with a JSON-schema validation in order to provide a more complete client-side validation. As of v2 of app frontend, client-side validation has support for type-checking basic types, including enums. When upgrading the frontend version to v2, the app must use nuget versions 1.0.82-alpha or newer. See details below.\nIn order to implement this, we have made changes to how we bind the data model to fields in the forms.\nThe change is only breaking for apps using OR-type xsd (or have fields with --character in xsd). Most Seres-type data models will not be affected, and will work without needing to make changes, even after updating to v2 of app frontend. If you do experience any problems with submitting/validating form data even with a seres-type xsd, follow the steps below. Errors For apps that use an OR-type xsd (or have fields with --character in xsd), the app may crash during submission/validation because the data model binding used does not match the true path in the json schema (and xsd). This is because we have been using a simplified path previously, to match with the C# model. We have now changed that so that the data binding name corresponds to the true xpath for the field.\nHow to fix If using app frontend v2 or newer, make sure app is using nuget packages v1.0.82-alpha or newer. See documentation on how to update dependencies..\nOpen the app in altinn.studio and upload datamodel again to generate a new version of the model files, with all the updated paths.\nPlease note that this overwrites any texts in the text resource files, so make sure to save a copy or push the app to the app repo before doing this, to recover any texts that might disappear. Update data model bindings in altinn.studio UI Editor, or update FormLayout.json with new data model bindings (see below for new format).\nEach part of the path now corresponds to the xname of the field in the xsd. F.ex: XSD:\n\u0026lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!--title=\u0026#39;Eksempel xsd skjema\u0026#39; lang=\u0026#39;NOB\u0026#39;--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element name=\u0026#34;Skjema\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:complexType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element minOccurs=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; ref=\u0026#34;SomeGroup-grp-1111\u0026#34; /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/xs:element\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:anyAttribute /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:complexType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:element\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element name=\u0026#34;SomeGroup-grp-1111\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:complexType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element minOccurs=\u0026#34;0\u0026#34; ref=\u0026#34;SomeField-datadef-12345\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:attribute fixed=\u0026#34;1111\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;gruppeid\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xs:positiveInteger\u0026#34; use=\u0026#34;required\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:complexType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:element\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element name=\u0026#34;SomeField-datadef-12345\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:simpleContent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:extension base=\u0026#34;SomeTextformat\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:attribute fixed=\u0026#34;12345\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;orid\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xs:positiveInteger\u0026#34; use=\u0026#34;required\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:extension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:simpleContent\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:complexType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:element\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:simpleType name=\u0026#34;SomeTextformat\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:restriction base=\u0026#34;xs:string\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:length value=\u0026#34;11\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:restriction\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:simpleType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:schema\u0026gt; Old format for data model binding: someGroupgrp1111.someFielddatatef12345.value.

Requests against these operations would work in AT environments, but would be broken by API Management in production like environments. The operations in question has now been removed and replaced with operations that require POST requests.\nErrors The methods that have been removed were used by an app when an instantiation were done by the Application owner.

This means the App must be updated and a the new version deployed to all environments. Existing instances are not affected.\nDeploy pipeline fails with error: UPGRADE FAILED Introduced with upgrade of AKS cluster.

This is because the dataType for the attachment expects application/octet-stream, but instead receives the actual mime type for the uploaded file.\nHow to fix Update allowedContentTypes for the data type that fails. This can either be done manually in the applications applicationMetadata.json for the affected data type(s) or by updating the FileUpload component in Altinn Studio so that the expected allowedContentTypes are saved.\nAfter updating, the app must be re-deployed.\nBuild fails after upgrading Altinn.App-nugets to version 1.0.62-alpha Introduced with issue: #3820.\nThe base class that every application inherits has been altered to allow for both data and task validation.\nError When building App.cs errors similar to those depicted in the picture below are logged.\nBuild errors How to fix If you haven\u0026rsquo;t made any changes to App/logic/Validation/ValidationHandler.cs and App/logic/App.cs the quickest way to fix the build errors are to copy these files from the template and paste them into your repository.

	"content": "1. Update the Altinn.App* package references to version 5.3.0. Navigate to your application repository and find App.csproj in the App folder.\nOnce you locate the file, update the Altinn.App.* package references to version 5.3.0.\n\u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Api\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;5.3.0\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;CopyToOutputDirectory\u0026gt;lib\\$(TargetFramework)\\*.xml\u0026lt;/CopyToOutputDirectory\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/PackageReference\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Common\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;5.3.0\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.PlatformServices\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;5.3.0\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; 2. PDF generation implementation moved out from AppBase/IAltinnApp All code related the generation of Pdf has been extracted from AppBase.cs and moved into PdfService.cs which in turn implements IPdfService. This opens up and allows us as service developers to replace the default Pdf implementation entirely.\nSince App.cs passes parameters to AppBase.cs you need to remove those no longer in use in the call to base(...) in the constructor:\nprocessService settings textService Your App constructor should then look something like this:\npublic App( IAppResources appResourcesService, ILogger\u0026lt;App\u0026gt; logger, IData dataService, IProcess processService, IPdfService pdfService, IProfile profileService, IRegister registerService, IPrefill prefillService, IInstance instanceService, IOptions\u0026lt;GeneralSettings\u0026gt; settings, IText textService, IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor) : base( appResourcesService, logger, dataService, pdfService, prefillService, instanceService, httpContextAccessor) It might be that you don\u0026rsquo;t use any of the removed services in you app code either, then you should remove those from the App constructor as well.\nIf you have implemented custom code to control Pdf generation, and depending on how you have done this, you have a couple options when it comes to what you need to do to resolve the breaking change. However the end result should be the same.\nCustom code in PdfHandler.cs\nThis is when you have added custom code in PdfHandler.cs. You should continue to use this class but it needs to implement an interface by following the steps below:\nMake sure the PdfHandler class implements the ICustomPdfHandler interface.\nNavigate to PdfHandler.cs and add : ICustomPdfHandler after the class name. The class should allready have the method defined in the interface. When adding the ICustomPdfHandlerinterface you also need to add a using statement using Altinn.App.PlatformServices.Interface;.\n/// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Handler for formatting PDF. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public class PdfHandler : ICustomPdfHandler { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Method to format PDF dynamic /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;example\u0026gt; /// if (data.GetType() == typeof(Skjema) /// { /// // need to create object if not there /// layoutSettings.Components.ExcludeFromPdf.Add(\u0026#34;a23234234\u0026#34;); /// } /// \u0026lt;/example\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;layoutSettings\u0026#34;\u0026gt;the layoutsettings\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;data\u0026#34;\u0026gt;data object\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; public async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { // Your code here return await Task.FromResult(layoutSettings); } } Register the PdfHandler implementation in Startup.cs\nAdd the following line\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;ICustomPdfHandler, PdfHandler\u0026gt;(); You should add it above the registration of your application\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;ICustomPdfHandler, PdfHandler\u0026gt;(); // Altinn App implementation service (The concrete implementation of logic from Application repository) services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IAltinnApp, AppLogic.App\u0026gt;(); Your custom implementation will now be injected into the PdfService implementation and be called during the Pdf generation process. When adding a custom PdfHandler you also need the using Altinn.App.AppLogic.Print; statement.\nCustom code in FormatPdf method\nThis the old way when you have your code directly in the overridden FormatPdf method in App.cs in your application.\npublic override async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { // You have code here... } Create a new class PdfHandler.cs and have it implement the ICustomPdfHandler interface\nMove your custom code to the FormatPdf method of the new class. You should then have a implementation similar to the example in step 1.1 above:\npublic class PdfHandler : ICustomPdfHandler { public async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { // Your code here return await Task.FromResult(layoutSettings); } } 3. Obsolete method GetOptionId removed from App/AppBase/IAltinnApp In version 4.24.0 we introduced a new way of supporting dynamic options making the GetOptionId methods in obsolete. The methods have now been removed and you should use the new way of implementing options as described in the documentation\nWhen you update your app you should then remove the following from App.cs as this method is removed from AppBase.cs:\n/// \u0026lt;inheritdoc /\u0026gt; #pragma warning disable CS0672 // Member overrides obsolete member public override Task\u0026lt;AppOptions\u0026gt; GetOptions(string id, AppOptions options) #pragma warning restore CS0672 // Member overrides obsolete member { return Task.FromResult(options); } 4. Obsolete method RunAppEvent removed from App/AppBase/IAltinnApp The RunAppEvent method is a old construct for hooking into various application events. This have been made obsolete by having concrete method overrides for each type of event as described in the documentation. The RunAppEvent method was passed in an AppEventType enum which specified the type of event that was fired. You would then need to have code checking the type and performing the logic needed. The table below shows the old enum values and their corresponding new methods that should be used instead.\nEnum Corresponding method Calculation RunProcessDataRead or RunProcessDataWrite Instantiation RunDataCreation ValidateInstantiation RunInstantiationValidation Validation RunDataValidation DataRetrieval RunProcessDataRead BeforeProcessChange OnStartProcess AfterProcessChange OnEndProcess AppModelCreation CreateNewAppModel The AppEventType.cs has been removed. This was referenced and used in App.cs - both the using reference and usage needs to be removed.\nDelete the following:\nusing Altinn.App.Common.Enums; and\n/// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Run app event /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;remarks\u0026gt;DEPRECATED METHOD, USE EVENT SPECIFIC METHOD INSTEAD\u0026lt;/remarks\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;appEvent\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The app event type\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;model\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The service model\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;modelState\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The model state\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;returns\u0026gt;True if the event was handled\u0026lt;/returns\u0026gt; public override async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; RunAppEvent(AppEventType appEvent, object model, ModelStateDictionary modelState = null) { _logger.LogInformation($\u0026#34;RunAppEvent {appEvent}\u0026#34;); return await Task.FromResult(true); } The RunAppEventmethod should be replaced with the appropriate methods as described above.\n5. Obsolete methods RunCalculation removed from AppBase/IAltinnApp In version 4.7.0 the RunCalculation method was replaced with the methods RunProcessDataRead and RunProcessDataWrite. RunCalculation has now been removed and those that have code in this method needs to move this to either RunProcessDataRead or RunProcessDataWrite.\nThe process to update is:\nAdd the DataProcessing folder and DataProcessingHandler class from our app template to your app. Update App.cs. Add a class field for DataProcessingHandler and copy new methods (RunProcessDataRead and RunProcessDataWrite) from App.cs Move logic from calculation handler to DataProcessingHandler Remove RunCalculation method from App.cs Remove CalculationHandler when code has been moved to DataProcessingHandler. Compile and test your app. "

Work your way through the rest of this page and you will remove them one at a time.\nUpgrading Program.cs It\u0026rsquo;s highly recommended to follow the migration guide to v6 if your application still hasn\u0026rsquo;t been upgraded to from v4 or v5.\nIn previous versions Altinn provided code and registration of custom/override services where hard to separate. As an attempt to make it easier to see customer provided services we have extracted most of our code and introduced a new method at the top of Program.cs\nSteps:\nIdentify the custom services your application has registered in Program.cs. Take a note of these as we will have to register them again later. Copy and paste the version 7 of Program.cs from our template at altinn/app-template-dotnet into your App/Program.cs (replacing existing code) Register your apps custom services from step 1 in the method RegisterCustomAppServices Replacing or upgrading old classes to implement new Interfaces Upgrade and register DataProcessingHandler Custom logic while performing DataWrite or DataRead are from v7 handled by registering a service class implementing Altinn.App.Core.Features.DataProcessing.IDataProcessor\nIf your App/logic/DataProcessing/DataProcessingHandler.cs is similar to the following code you can delete the file and move on Replace InstantiationHandler.cs and register new service.\nusing System; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.DataProcessing { public class DataProcessingHandler { public async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataRead(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { return await Task.FromResult(false); } public async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataWrite(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { return await Task.FromResult(false); } } } If you have custom code in this class complete the steps below:\nCreate a new class named DataProcessor in the folder App/logic/DataProcessing, make the class implement the interface Altinn.App.Core.Features.IDataProcessor. The file should now look something like this: using System; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.DataProcessing; public class DataProcessor : IDataProcessor { public async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataRead(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { } public async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataWrite(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { } } Note that you might have to add the async keyword if they aren\u0026rsquo;t added by default. You only need to add them if you do async calls within your code. Move your code from the file App/logic/DataProcessing/DataProcessingHandler.cs to the file you just created. Register DataProcessor in the method RegisterCustomAppServices App/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IDataProcessor, DataProcessor\u0026gt;(); // Other custom services } Remember to add the necessary usages. Delete the old DataProcessingHandler.cs file Replace InstantiationHandler.cs and register new service The logic that previously was defined in App/logic/InstantiationHandler.cs is now defined by implementing two interfaces\nIInstantiationProcessor is used to do custom data/instance manipulation during instantiation. Replaces the method DataCreation in InstantiationHandler IInstantiationValidator is used to do custom validation during Instantiation. Replaces the method RunInstantiationValidation in InstantiationHandler If your App/logic/InstantiationHandler.cs looks like the code below you have no custom code here and can delete the class now and move on to Upgrade ValidationHandler.cs and register new service\nusing System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Services.Interface; using Altinn.App.Services.Models.Validation; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic { public class InstantiationHandler { private IProfile _profileService; private IRegister _registerService; public InstantiationHandler(IProfile profileService, IRegister registerService) { _profileService = profileService; _registerService = registerService; } public async Task\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult\u0026gt; RunInstantiationValidation(Instance instance) { return await Task.FromResult((InstantiationValidationResult)null); } public async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { await Task.CompletedTask; } } } If you have custom code in the method DataCreation complete these steps:\nCreate a new Class named InstantiationProcessor.cs in App/logic/DataProcessing and implement the interface Altinn.App.Core.Features.IInstantiationProcessor. The class can be named or placed where you like, this is only a suggestion. The file should look something like this now: using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.DataProcessing; public class InstantiationProcessor : IInstantiationProcessor { public async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { } } Move all the code from DataCreation in ÌnstantiationHandler.cs into the method DataCreation in the class you just created. Register InstantiationProcessor in the method RegisterCustomAppServices App/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IInstantiationProcessor, InstantiationProcessor\u0026gt;(); // Other custom services } Remember to add the necessary usages. If you have custom code in the method RunInstantiationValidation complete the steps below, if not delete App/logic/InstantiationHandler.cs and move on to Upgrade ValidationHandler.cs and register new service:\nCreate a new Class named InstantiationValidator.cs in App/logic/Validation and implement the interface Altinn.App.Core.Features.IInstantiationValidator. The class can be named or placed where you like, this is only a suggestion. The file should look something like this now: using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Models.Validation; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.Validation; public class InstantiationValidator : IInstantiationValidator { public async Task\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult\u0026gt; Validate(Instance instance) { } } Move all the code from RunInstantiationValidation in ÌnstantiationHandler.cs into the method Validate in the class you just created. Register InstantiationValidator in the method RegisterCustomAppServices App/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IInstantiationValidator, InstantiationValidator\u0026gt;(); // Other custom services } Remember to add the necessary usages. You can now delete the file App/logic/InstantiationHandler.cs\nUpgrade ValidationHandler.cs and register new service Custom data and task validation is in v7 handled by registering a service class implementing Altinn.App.Core.Features.IInstanceValidator.\nIf your App/logic/Validation/ValidationHandler.cs looks like the code below you have no custom code and can delete the file. And move on to Upgrading custom PdfFormatting.\nusing System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ModelBinding; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.Validation { public class ValidationHandler { private IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor; public ValidationHandler(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor = null) { _httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor; } public async Task ValidateData(object data, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { await Task.CompletedTask; } public async Task ValidateTask(Instance instance, string taskId, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { await Task.CompletedTask; } } } If you have custom code here complete the steps below:\nCreate a new class named InstanceValidator in the folder App/logic/Validation, make the class implement the interface Altinn.App.Core.Features.IInstanceValidator. The file should now look something like this: using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ModelBinding; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.Validation; public class InstanceValidator : IInstanceValidator { public async Task ValidateData(object data, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { } public async Task ValidateTask(Instance instance, string taskId, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { } } Move the code in ValidateData method in the old class ValidatorHandler to the new one in InstanceValidator class. Move the code in ValidateTask method in the old class ValidatorHandler to the new one in InstanceValidator class. Register InstanceValidator in the method RegisterCustomAppServices App/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IInstanceValidator, InstanceValidator\u0026gt;(); // Other custom services } Remember to add the necessary usages. Delete the ValidationHandler.cs file. Upgrading Custom PDF formatting logic In previous versions dynamic customization was handled by registering a service implementing ICustomPdfHandler. In v7 this is done by registering a service implementing Altinn.App.Core.Features.Pdf.IPdfFormatter\nIf your App/logic/Pdf/PdfHandler.cs looks like the following code you have no custom code and can delete the file and move on to Updating PageOrder logic\nusing System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Common.Models; using Altinn.App.PlatformServices.Interface; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.Print { public class PdfHandler: ICustomPdfHandler { public async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { return await Task.FromResult(layoutSettings); } } } If not, complete the steps below:\nCreate a new class named PdfFormatter in the folder App/logic/Pdf. make the class implement the interface Altinn.App.Core.Features.IPdfFormatter. The file should now look something like this: using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Models; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.Pdf { public class PdfFormatter: IPdfFormatter { public async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { } } } Move your code from ICustomPdfHandler to the newly created PdfFormatter class. Register PdfFormatter in the method RegisterCustomAppServices App/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IPdfFormatter, PdfFormatter\u0026gt;(); // Other custom services } Remember to add the necessary usages. Delete the old file Remove the transient service registration of the old class from Program.cs. Should look something like this: services.AddTransient\u0026lt;ICustomPdfHandler, PdfHandler\u0026gt;(); (remove it by deleting the line) Upgrading PageOrder.cs In v5 of the nugets tracks or page order was extracted in a non-breaking way from App.cs. The old way was deprecated in v6 and now removed in v7.\nThe new way of defining page order in v5 has not really changed in v7, but some interfaces has moved namespace.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have any classes implementing IPageOrder you can safely move on to Moving code form App.cs and removing it\nIf you do have a class implementing IPageOrder here are some changes in namespace that might be helpful to know:\nThe namespace for IPageOrder has changed from Altinn.App.Services.Interfaces to Altinn.App.Core.Features.PageOrder The namespace for AppIdentifier has changed from Altinn.App.PlatformSerices.Models to Altinn.App.Core.Models The namespace for IAppResources has changed from Altinn.App.PlatformSerices.Interface Altinn.App.Core.Interface Moving eFormidling code This next chapter only applies to applications which integrates with eFormidling. If yours don\u0026rsquo;t you can move on to Moving code from App.cs and removing it\nTo determine if your app is integrated against eFormidling check if you have defined the method GenerateEFormidlingMetadata defined in App/logic/App.cs\nMove code from GenerateEFormidlingMetadata in App.cs Create a new class named EFormidlingMetadata in the folder App/logic/EFormidling. You can name and place the file whatever and wherever you like, this is just an suggestion. Make the newly created class implement the interface Altinn.App.Core.EFormidling.Interface.IEFormidlingMetadata. The file should look something like this now: using System.IO; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.EFormidling.Interface; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.logic.EFormidling; public class EFormidlingMetadata : IEFormidlingMetadata { public Task\u0026lt;(string MetadataFilename, Stream Metadata)\u0026gt; GenerateEFormidlingMetadata(Instance instance) { } } Move the code from the method GenerateEFormidlingMetadata in App/logic/App.cs to the method GenerateEFormidlingMetadata in the class you just created. Move code from GetEFormidlingReceivers in App.cs If you have no definition of GetEFormidlingReceivers in App/logic/App.cs you can move on to Register Eformidling implementation. If it is defined complete the following steps\nCreate a new class named EFormidlingReceiversin App/logic/EFormidling. You can name and place the file whatever and wherever you like, this is just an suggestion. Make the new class implement the interface Altinn.App.Core.EFormidling.Interface.IEFormidlingReceivers. The file should look something like this now: using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.EFormidling.Interface; using Altinn.Common.EFormidlingClient.Models.SBD; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.logic.EFormidling; public class EFormidlingReceivers : IEFormidlingReceivers { public Task\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;Receiver\u0026gt;\u0026gt; GetEFormidlingReceivers(Instance instance) { } } Move the code from the method GetEFormidlingReceivers in App/logic/App.cs to the mwthod GetEformidlingReceivers in the class you just created. Register Eformidling implementation This step depends on the previous steps. Whether your code has custom logic for GetEFormidlingReceivers or not.\nIn the method RegisterCustomAppServices in Program.cs you need to register the eFormidling implementation.\nTo add eFormidling services and your implementation EFormidlingMetadata add this to your RegisterCustomAppServices.\nvoid RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { services.AddEFormidlingServices\u0026lt;EFormidlingMetadata\u0026gt;(config); } This will register the default implementation of IEFormidlingReceivers\nIf you have a custom implementation of IEFormidlingReceivers you should add your implementation as the second type parameter:\nvoid RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { services.AddEFormidlingServices\u0026lt;EFormidlingMetadata, EFormidlingReceivers\u0026gt;(config); } Moving code from App.cs and removing it As we are going to extract code from App.cs and eventually removing it there is no need to pay attention to compilation error.\nThe next sections will extract custom code from App.cs, if any, and move it to its new home.\nMoving custom code in RunProcessDataRead and RunProcessDataWrite If RunProcessDataRead and RunProcessDataWrite in App/App.cs looks like the code below you have no custom code and can safely move on to Moving custom code in RunDataValidation and RunTaskValidation. If not complete the steps below.\npublic override async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; RunProcessDataRead(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { return await _dataProcessingHandler.ProcessDataRead(instance, dataId, data); } public override async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; RunProcessDataWrite(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { return await _dataProcessingHandler.ProcessDataWrite(instance, dataId, data); } Move custom code in RunProcessDataRead to the method ProcessDataRead in App/logic/DataProcessing/DataProcessor.cs that was created and registered in the step Upgrade and register DataProcessingHadler Move custom code in RunProcessDataWrite to the method ProcessDataWrite in App/logic/DataProcessing/DataProcessor.cs Moving custom code in RunDataValidation and RunTaskValidation If RunDataValidationand RunTaskValidation looks like the code below you have no custom code and can safely move on to Moving custom code in RunInstantiationValidation and RunDataCreation. If not complete the steps below\npublic override async Task RunDataValidation(object data, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { await _validationHandler.ValidateData(data, validationResults); } public override async Task RunTaskValidation(Instance instance, string taskId, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { await _validationHandler.ValidateTask(instance, taskId, validationResults); } Move custom code in RunDataValidation to the method ValidateData in App/logic/Validation/InstanceValidator.cs that you created and registered here Upgrade ValidationHandler.cs and register new service. Move custom code in RunTaskValidation to the method ValidateTask in App/logic/Validation/InstanceValidator.cs Moving custom code in RunDataCreation If RunDataCreation looks like the code below you have no custom code and can safely move on to Moving custom code in RunInstantiationValidation. If not complete the steps below.\npublic override async Task RunDataCreation(Instance instance, object data, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { await _instantiationHandler.DataCreation(instance, data, prefill); } If you haven\u0026rsquo;t already: Create a new class named InstantiationProcessor.cs in App/logic/DataProcessing and implement the interface Altinn.App.Core.Features.IInstantiationProcessor. The class can be named or placed where you like, this is only a suggestion. The file should look something like this now: using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.DataProcessing; public class InstantiationProcessor : IInstantiationProcessor { public async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { } } Move custom code in DataCreation to the method DataCreation in App/logic/DataProcessing/InstantiationHandler.cs that you created and registered here Replace InstantiationHandler.cs and register new service Register InstantiationProcessor in the method RegisterCustomAppServices App/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IInstantiationProcessor, InstantiationProcessor\u0026gt;(); // Other custom services } Remember to add the necessary usages. Moving custom code in RunInstantiationValidation If RunInstantiationValidation looks like the code below you have no custom code and can safely move on to Moving custom code in RunProcessTaskEnd. If not complete the steps below.\npublic override async Task\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult\u0026gt; RunInstantiationValidation(Instance instance) { return await _instantiationHandler.RunInstantiationValidation(instance); } If you haven\u0026rsquo;t already: Create a new Class named InstantiationValidator.cs in App/logic/Validation and implement the interface Altinn.App.Core.Features.IInstantiationValidator. The class can be named or placed where you like, this is only a suggestion. The file should look something like this now: using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Models.Validation; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.Validation; public class InstantiationValidator : IInstantiationValidator { public async Task\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult\u0026gt; Validate(Instance instance) { } } Move all the code from RunInstantiationValidation in ÌnstantiationHandler.cs into the method Validate in the class you just created. Register InstantiationValidator in the method RegisterCustomAppServices App/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IInstantiationValidator, InstantiationValidator\u0026gt;(); // Other custom services } Remember to add the necessary usages. Moving custom code in RunProcessTaskEnd If RunProcessTaskEnd looks like the code below you have no custom code and can safely move on to Moving custom code in GetPageOrder. If not complete the steps below.\npublic override async Task RunProcessTaskEnd(string taskId, Instance instance) { await Task.CompletedTask; } Create a new class implementing the Interface Altinn.App.Core.Features.IProcessTaskEnd you can name and place this class wherever you like, but as a suggestion you can create and place it in the folder App/logic/TaskProcessors and name the file ProcessTaskEnd. The class should look something like this after the interface is implemented: using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.TaskProcessors; public class ProcessTaskEnd: IProcessTaskEnd { public Task End(string taskId, Instance instance) { return Task.CompletedTask; } } Move code from RunProcessTaskEndto the method IProcessTaskEndin the class implementing IProcessTaskEnd Register your custom implementation of IProcessTaskEnd in the method RegisterCustomAppServices inside App/Program.cs Moving custom code in GetPageOrder If GetPageOrder in App/logic/App.cs is not present you have no custom code and can safely move on the Removing App.cs. If not complete the steps below.\nCreate a new class implementing the interface Altinn.App.Core.Features.IPageOrder you can name and place this class wherever you like in your project, but a suggestion is to name it PageOrder and place it in the folder App/logic/PageOrder. The file should look something like this now: using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Models; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Interface; using Altinn.App.Core.Models; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.PageOrder; public class PageOrder : IPageOrder { public async Task\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;\u0026gt; GetPageOrder(AppIdentifier appIdentifier, InstanceIdentifier instanceIdentifier, string layoutSetId, string currentPage, string dataTypeId, object formData) { } } Move the code from GetPageOrder to the method GetPageOrder in the class you just created. Register your custom implementation of IPageOrder in the method RegisterCustomAppServices inside App/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IPageOrder, PageOrder\u0026gt;(); // Other custom services } Remember to add the necessary usages. Removing App.cs Now all your custom code should be moved out of App.cs, take a look in the file and see if there is any code you need to move left.\nSee the old default App.cs here\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t see any code worth keeping go ahead and delete the file. All of the logic Altinn used to have in this file is moved elsewhere in our code and should not leak into you application code.\nNotable namespace changes This is truly not a complete list of alle the changes to namespace we have done in v7, for that see the actual PR on Github\nThe following list is some of the namespaces that have changed that we think will affect most of the applications\nInterfaces that service owners naturally overrides/customize is moved from Altinn.App.PlatformServices.Interfaces to Altinn.App.Core.Features Altinn.App.Common.Models namespace is moved to Altinn.App.Core.Models Altinn.App.PlatformServices.Interface.ICustomPdfHandler interface is moved and renamed to: Altinn.App.Core.Features.Pdf.IPdfFormatter Recommended plugin for Visual Studio Code There are a lot of changes to namespaces so we strongly recommend using Visual Studio Code with the C# plugin installed. This will give you code help for importing and locating new or changed interfaces.\nPlugin information: Name: C# Id: ms-dotnettools.csharp Description: C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp).

Our DevOps team only manages and maintains the agent nodes. As a managed Kubernetes service, AKS is free - Microsoft only charges for the agent nodes within your clusters, not for the masters.\nWith more than 50 orgs hosting services in Altinn 2 it is expected that Altinn 3 will have several hundreds of AKS clusters managed by the DevOps team.\nSee org setup for current status on environments\nNodes Each AKS cluster has one Node Pool\nFor each Node Pool there is a set of nodes.\nThe size of the node pool varies depends on the type of cluster.\nCurrently, we use Dsv3-series\nStandard_D2s_v3 is the current standard for org clusters Standard_D4s_v3 is used on a medium cluster Standard_D8s_v3 is used on the clusters with the highest requirements. The number of nodes can vary between the different clusters. Microsoft recommends not to have less than three nodes in a single system node pool.\nNode scaling Supported Kubernetes Versions The Kubernetes community releases minor versions roughly every three months. These releases include new features and improvements. Patch releases are more frequent (sometimes weekly) and are intended for critical bug fixes within a minor version. These patch releases include fixes for security vulnerabilities or major bugs.\nAKS supports the latest versions of Kubernetes.\nSee a list of Supported Kubernetes Versions.\nThe Altinn DevOps team upgrades the different Kubernetes Clusters.\nAzure Functions Apps Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date servers needed to keep your applications running.\nIn Altinn 3 we use Azure Function Apps to the following\nData Cleanup : A application for cleaning up data CosmosBackup : A application that backup data for cosmos DB in to a blob storage. Events Inbound: Responsible for triggering processing of incomming events in Altinn Events Events Outbound: Responsible for pushing events to consumer endpoints Subscription Validation: Responsible for validation of subscription endpoints Delegation Events: Pushing information about rights delegation in Altinn 3 to Altinn 2 Azure Container Apps Azure Container Apps are fully managed serverless container service for building and deploying modern apps at scale that we use to run some services.\nIn Altinn 3 we use Azure Container Apps for the following.\nAccess Management BFF Security Log (TODO) We are looking into moving other components from Azure Kubernetes Services to reduce cost of management of clusters.\nVirtual machines Developer machines Our developer machines are hosted as virtual machines in Azure.\nScaling compute resourcesTraffic to Altinn varies widely during a year and scaling the compute resources correctly is important for stability and cost.\n"

	"content": "Service Owner This section describes what the service owner must do to make data available through the consent service.\nCreate a service that requires consent Create or adapt an API that exposes the data that should be shared based on consent. The API must accept a valid consent token (JWT) from the data consumer as proof that the end user has issued a consent. Clearly describe which data is shared and under which conditions. Register scopes for the service Assign one or more OAuth2 scopes to the service in Maskinporten. These scopes identify the rights (resources) that require consent. Each scope should be purpose-specific, for example altinn:inntekt.read. Create a consent resource in the Resource Registry The Resource Registry stores the description of the authorisation resource and its access rules. Make sure potential consumers know which access packages (and any individual rights) are required to use the service. Read more about the required fields in the consent resource guide. Manage access lists You can use access lists to control which data consumers are allowed to use the service. This requires a process for adding new data consumers to the lists when needed.\nData consumers that are not included in the access list cannot create consent requests, and the flow stops before the end user is asked for consent. Learn more about access lists here.\nProvide information and documentation Document:\nwhich steps the data consumer must complete which access packages and scopes are required who to contact to obtain access Validate consent The consent token is a thick token that contains everything you need to validate the consent. Validation can therefore be performed without calling Altinn Authorization. See the validation guidance for details. Data Consumer / End-User System This section explains what the data consumer must do to start using the consent service.\nRegister a Maskinporten client Maskinporten is one of the foundation blocks that the consent solution builds on. Maskinporten ensures authenticity and allows the service owner to perform coarse-grained access control through scopes. The Maskinporten token carries the consent information, enabling the service owner to authorise access based on the token contents. You need a Norwegian organisation number to access Maskinporten. See Maskinporten for details.\nBy signing the terms of use for Maskinporten and ID-porten you gain access to the test and production environments at Digdir.\nConnect to Maskinporten – follow the steps described in Connect to Maskinporten. Create a Maskinporten client. You can create the client in Samarbeidsportalen or through the API. Creating a client requires that the Maskinporten connection is in place. See the Maskinporten client guide. Receive consent scopes and API Key from Digdir Sign the terms of use for Altinn end-user system vendors to access the test and production environments. Complete the registration form for end-user system vendors and tick consent to obtain the required scopes: altinn:consentrequests.read altinn:consentrequests.write Request access to the service owner\u0026#39;s APIs The service owner decides which scopes control access to their APIs. These scopes are different from the consent API scopes and are granted by the service owner. Find the required scopes in the service owner\u0026rsquo;s documentation or by contacting them directly. If the service owner uses access lists, make sure your organisation number is added before requesting data. Integrate with the consent APIs See the consent integration guides for details on how to integrate your end-user system with Altinn\u0026rsquo;s consent APIs. "

What: Covers how to interpret authorization_details and consentRights, and how to verify that the token includes the rights your service requires. Link: Open the guide for validating consent. Before you start You must have resource administration access for your organization in Altinn Studio. If you do not, follow the steps in the Getting Started guide.\nRecommended order of work Read the guide on creating the consent resource and configure the resource in the TT02 test environment. Implement and validate the consent inside your service before moving to production. Run an end-to-end test with both the resource administrator and the service integration to confirm the consent covers the right dataset and that the token is interpreted correctly.

For example, this could be a restriction on which data or which year the consent applies to.\nThis metadata can be presented as part of the consent text shown to the end user.\nOne-Time Consent If you want the service to only be available via one-time consent, you can set this option.\nThis means that the party requesting consent can only retrieve data once, regardless of the period length.\n"

The example app is available in Altinn Studio.\nWe will be using the RestCountries v3 API, and more specifically the endpoint https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{country}. This endpoint returns metadata about the provided country.\nYou may test the API in your browser and study the response: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/Norway.\nWe would like to enrich the form data with details about the country that the end user fills out.\nCreating models for the API If the API you are consuming is documented with Swagger or OpenAPI, you can easily generate C# classes based on the documentation.\nThis can be done manually, or by using available online tools.\nIn this example, the response object is quite large and contains much more data than we are interested in.\nHere is an abbreviated version of the response object for Norway:\n[ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;common\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Norway\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;official\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Kingdom of Norway\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nativeName\u0026#34;: {} }, \u0026#34;idd\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;capital\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Oslo\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;altSpellings\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;region\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Europe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subregion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Northern Europe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;languages\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;translations\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;latlng\u0026#34;: [ 62, 10 ], \u0026#34;landlocked\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;borders\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;area\u0026#34;: 323802, \u0026#34;demonyms\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;flag\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;🇳🇴\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maps\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;population\u0026#34;: 5379475, \u0026#34;postalCode\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;format\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;###\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;regex\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^(\\\\d{4})$\u0026#34; } } ] In the application we are only interested in the data in the lines highlighted: capital and region. We create a minimal response object that only contains the properties we are interested in.\nIn the folder App/models a new file Country.cs is created.\nusing System.Collections.Generic; namespace Altinn.App.models { public class Country { public List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; Capital { get; set; } public string Region { get; set; } } } The Country object contains the fields Capital og Region. Capital is a list of strings as a country can contain multiple capital cities.\nIn this example, the API doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a complex request object, so we only need this one model. Should you need a separate model for the request object, a class can be created the same way.\nSetting up an interface for the client It is recommended that an interface is defined for the client that will call the API. This enables you to benefit from the strengths of .NET with dependency injection and efficient handling of HTTP clients.\nIn the application repository, a new folder App/clients is created. Within this folder, a new file ICountryClient.cs is created.\nThe interface consists of a single method GetCountry, which accepts a string and returns a Country-object.\nDefine the interface as shown below.\nusing System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.models; namespace Altinn.App.client { public interface ICountryClient { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Retrieves metadata about the provided country. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;country\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The name of the country\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;returns\u0026gt;A country object\u0026lt;/returns\u0026gt; public Task\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; GetCountry(string country); } } The return object is framed by Task\u0026lt;...\u0026gt;, this is added to support the asynchronous running of this method.\nImplement the client The client contains the code that makes the request towards the API and maps the response to the Country-model, which is what the methods using the client expect as an output.\nThe full implementation of CountryClient is shown below.\nusing System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Net.Http; using System.Text.Json; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.models; using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; namespace Altinn.App.client { public class CountryClient : ICountryClient { HttpClient _client; ILogger\u0026lt;ICountryClient\u0026gt; _logger; JsonSerializerOptions _serializerOptions; public CountryClient(HttpClient client, ILogger\u0026lt;ICountryClient\u0026gt; logger) { _logger = logger; _client = client; _client.BaseAddress = new Uri(\u0026#34;https://restcountries.com/v3.1\u0026#34;); _serializerOptions = new() { PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true }; } public async Task\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; GetCountry(string country) { string query = $\u0026#34;name/{country}\u0026#34;; HttpResponseMessage res = await _client.GetAsync(query); if (res.IsSuccessStatusCode) { string resString = await res.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); List\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; countryResponse = JsonSerializer.Deserialize\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(resString, _serializerOptions); return countryResponse.Any() ? countryResponse.First() : null; } else { _logger.LogError(\u0026#34;Retrieving country {country} failed with status code {statusCode}\u0026#34;, country, res.StatusCode); return null; } } } } At the top of the file you find a reference to all the namespaces the class depends on.\nusing System; using System.Linq; using System.Net.Http; using System.Text.Json; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.models; using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; Further, we define the class and which interface it inherits from.\npublic class CountryClient : ICountryClient Further, three private objects _client, __logger and _serializerOptions\nprivate readonly HttpClient _client; private readonly ILogger\u0026lt;ICountryClient\u0026gt; _logger; private readonly JsonSerializerOptions _serializerOptions; The underscore before the name is simply a naming convention and does not have a functional effect.\n_client will be populated with an HTTP client in the constructor _logger will be populated with a logger, enabling logging error messages and other messages in the client logic _serializerOptions will be instantiated and configured in the constructor to support deserialization of the API response Further in the class, the constructor is defined.\npublic CountryClient(HttpClient client, ILogger\u0026lt;ICountryClient\u0026gt; logger) { _logger = logger; _client = client; _client.BaseAddress = new Uri(\u0026#34;https://restcountries.com/v3.1\u0026#34;); _serializerOptions = new() { PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true }; } Objects are populated if there are matching inputs in the constructor, and the remaining objects are instantiated directly in the constructor.\nIf you require additional services in this class, simply add a private object and inject its interface in the constructor as we have done for _logger and _client.\nFurther, you find the implementation of GetCountry.\npublic async Task\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; GetCountry(string country) { string query = $\u0026#34;name/{country}\u0026#34;; HttpResponseMessage res = await _client.GetAsync(query); if (res.IsSuccessStatusCode) { string resString = await res.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); List\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; countryResponse = JsonSerializer.Deserialize\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(resString, _serializerOptions); return countryResponse.Any() ? countryResponse.First() : null; } else { _logger.LogError(\u0026#34;Retrieving country {country} failed with status code {statusCode}\u0026#34;, country, res.StatusCode); return null; } } Here, the status code of the API call is verified before it is deserialized and the country object returned. If the statusCode is not one that indicates success, a log entry is made and null is returned.\nRegistering the client in the application Once the interface and client is implemented, it should be registered in App/Program.cs (.NET 6) or App/Startup.cs (.NET 5), to make it available to use in the application.\nIn the Program.cs class, the line below is included. In addition, using Altinn.App.client; and using Altinn.App.AppLogic.DataProcessing; is added at the top of the file.\nvoid RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env) { services.AddHttpClient\u0026lt;ICountryClient, CountryClient\u0026gt;(); services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IDataProcessor, DataProcessor\u0026gt;(); // Register your apps custom service implementations here. } Using the client in the application logic To enrich the form data we need to include the use of our client in the logic in the method ProcessDataWrite in App/logic/DataProcessingHandler.cs for versions prior to v7 of the application template. For v7 please refer to the documentation on DataProcessing.\nFirst the client must be made available by injecting it in the constructor of the class. DataProcessingHandler does not have a constructor by default, so this needs to be created. In addition, using Altinn.App.client; must be added to the top of the file.\npublic DataProcessingHandler() { } Further, add a private field for the client, inject the client into the constructor and assign it to the private client instance. The result should look like this:\nprivate readonly ICountryClient _countryClient; public DataProcessingHandler(ICountryClient countryClient) { _countryClient = countryClient; } using Altinn.App.client; must be added to this file as well.\n_countryClient is now available in DataProcessingHandler, and we\u0026rsquo;re ready to implement the logic in the ProcessDataWrite method.\nNOTE: Stateless apps don\u0026rsquo;t call ProcessDataWrite. Use ProcessDataRead for stateless apps. public async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataWrite(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { if (data.GetType() == typeof(skjema)) { skjema skjema = (skjema)data; if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(skjema.land)) { Country country = await _countryClient.GetCountry(skjema.land.Trim()); if (country != null) { skjema.hovedstad = string.Join(\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;, country.Capital); skjema.region = country.Region; } else { skjema.hovedstad = skjema.region = string.Empty; } return true; } else { skjema.hovedstad = string.Empty; skjema.region = string.Empty; } } return await Task.FromResult(false); } If you attempt to build the application at this point, an error will occur. DataProcessingHandler is instantiated in App.cs, so all dependencies must be included in this file and included in the initialization of DataProcessingHandler.\nIn the file App/logic/App.cs, the following changes are made.\nAdd a reference to the namespace of the client at the top of the file.\nusing Altinn.App.client; Inject ICountryClient as the last element of the App.cs-constructor.\nThis is done in line 14:\n1public App( 2 IAppResources appResourcesService, 3 ILogger\u0026lt;App\u0026gt; logger, 4 IData dataService, 5 IProcess processService, 6 IPDF pdfService, 7 IProfile profileService, 8 IRegister registerService, 9 IPrefill prefillService, 10 IInstance instanceService, 11 IOptions\u0026lt;GeneralSettings\u0026gt; settings, 12 IText textService, 13 IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor, 14 ICountryClient countryClient) : base( 15 appResourcesService, 16 logger, 17 dataService, 18 processService, 19 pdfService, 20 prefillService, 21 instanceService, 22 registerService, 23 settings, 24 profileService, 25 textService, 26 httpContextAccessor) Include countryClient in the initialization of DataProcessingHandler.\n_dataProcessingHandler = new DataProcessingHandler(countryClient); Caching of response data One drawback of the example as it now stands, is that a request will be made to the API every time any of the form data is updated.\nIt is a reasonable assumption that a country\u0026rsquo;s capital and region will not change frequently.

For links and formatting use markdown.\nThis results in the following view:\nOverridden texts in the confirm view Custom form layout For the confirm task the app developer has the possibility for configuring their own layout set with corresponding form layout definitions and other ui-configuration files which are included in the data step.\nThis makes the confirmation page customizable, and can use the components that are supported in Altinn Studio.\nSince the confirm step is not meant to be used for writing data, a good practice would be to use static components ( header, paragraph) and set other components to readOnly.\nAn example setup of the layout-sets.json where Task_1 is a data step, and Task_2 a confirmation step:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout-sets.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sets\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;simple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;simple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;custom-confirmation\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;simple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;Task_2\u0026#34;] } ] } Notice that the layout-set configuration for Task_2 references the data model used in Task_1.\nExample formLayout.json file that presents data from the data model used in the data-task:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;paragraph\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Paragraph\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;paragraph\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;name.label\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Felt1\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: true }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lastname\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lastName.label\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Felt2\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: true } ] } } The app structure would look look this:\n├───App │ ├───config │ ├───logic │ ├───models | | ... │ ├───ui │ │ ├───custom-confirmation │ │ │ └───layouts | | | └─── ... │ │ └───simple │ │ └───layouts | | | └─── ...

More information about how this is done can be found here.\nIf the actual recipient of the form is a different organization than the organization owning the app, the receipt should reflect this in the Receiver field. This can be done by setting the text resource appReceiver to the name of the actual recipient.\nCustomize texts Texts that can be customized in the receipt view Text # (see image above) Text key 1 receipt.receipt 2 receipt.title 3 receipt.subtitle 4 receipt.body 5 receipt.title_submitted Example of custom texts in the file resources.nb.json:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;receipt.receipt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Søknad om flytting til Sogndal kommune\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;receipt.title\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Takk, søknaden er sendt!\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;receipt.subtitle\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Finn kopi av dine svar i Altinn Innboks\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;receipt.body\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Saksbehandling av denne type søknader tar vanligvis opp til 4 uker.

The functionality will also soon be available in Altinn Studio.\nTo create a custom receipt view, you create a new layout set. This layout set works exactly like all other page types. Within the layout set, you can create a layouts folder and here define all the pages you want to include in the receipt view (Yes, the receipt view supports multiple pages!). Inside the layout set, you must also create a Settings.json, where you can define the order of the pages in the receipt view.\nFor the app to understand that this layout set should be used as a receipt view, you must refer to the name of the layout set in layout-sets.json. Add a new layout set with id that refers to the name of your layout set, and add the key value \u0026quot;CustomReceipt\u0026quot; in the tasks array of the layout set. In addition, you can specify which data model should be available in the receipt view by adding the key dataType with the name of the data model you want to support.\nHere is a complete example where we have a layout set named custom-receipt that will be used as a receipt view:\nFolder structure |- App/ |- ui/ |- layout-sets.json |- custom-receipt/ |- layouts/ |- page1.json |- page2.json |- Settings.json Code App/ui/layout-sets.json { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout-sets.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sets\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;custom-receipt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;fields\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tasks\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;CustomReceipt\u0026#34;] } ] } Code App/ui/custom-receipt/Settings.json { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;page1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;page2\u0026#34;] } } Example of a custom layout for the receipt:\nCode App/ui/custom-receipt/layouts/page1.json { \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReceiptHeader\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Header\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;receipt.title\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;h2\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;fa796d12-49fc-457a-9d9a-d153998d55de\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Image\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Bilde\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;src\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://docs.altinn.studio/altinn-studio/getting-started/app-dev-course/modul2/kommune-logo.png\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;width\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;100%\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;align\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;flex-start\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 2 } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReceiptParagraph\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Paragraph\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;receipt.body\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 10 } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReceiptInstanceInformation\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;InstanceInformation\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;elements\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;dateSent\u0026#34;: false } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReceiptHeader\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Header\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;receipt.title_submitted\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;h4\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReceiptAttachmentList\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AttachmentList\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataTypeIds\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;ref-data-as-pdf\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;includePDF\u0026#34;: true } ] } } Resulting receipt in the application:\nCustom receipt Customizing texts in Simple Receipt Simple receipt is a concept that becomes relevant for those applications that have enabled AutoDeleteOnProcessEnd: True in their applicationmetadata.json file.

	"content": "Data processing is run on the server and is based on input from the user/form data. Data processing can be purely mathematical calculations, or it could transfer values between fields, retrieve results from API calls, etc.\nData processing runs each time data is saved, meaning it runs each time a user has made a change.\nTo ensure optimal experience and control, the application template has two different events where logic can be placed.\nProcessDataWrite runs when data is saved ProcessDataRead runs when data is read from the database IMPORTANT: When a data processing that has updated the data on the server has been run, the front-end must be notified so that the updated data can be loaded. To do this, the ProcessdataWrite method must return true if any of the data has been updated. If this is not done, the updated data won\u0026rsquo;t be visible for the user until they refresh the page. v7 In version 7 the way to do custom code instantiation has changed. We now use an dependency injection based approach insted of overriding methods. If you previously used to place your custom code in the ProcessDataWrite and ProcessDataWrite_ methods in the DataProcessingHandler.cs class you will see that it\u0026rsquo;s mostly the same.\nCreate a class that implements the IDataProcessor interface found in the Altinn.App.Core.Features.DataProcessing namespace.\nYou can name and place the file in any folder you like within your project, but we suggest you use meaningful namespaces like in any other .Net project.

Build and deploy a new version of your app. App frontend App frontend is loaded at runtime, through a link to the javascript-file for app frontend. This javascript-file uses Semantic Versioning:\nGiven a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:\nMAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.\nAdditional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.\nThe app references by default to a major version of app frontend, e.g. version 1.x.y With the default setup all minor and patch version will be automatically pulled in. If a new major version is published you need to update your app to pull this new version, watch out for breaking changes)\nIf you want to lock the frontend to a specific version of app frontend (e.g. 1.2.3) you specify this directly in the URL that points to app frontend.\nUpgrade to new version / specific version The reference to app frontend is located in App/views/Home/Index.cshtml.\nYou need to update two references:\nReference to altinn-app-frontend.js-file which contains the code for app frontend. \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/\u0026lt;VERSIONNUMBER\u0026gt;/altinn-app-frontend.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Reference to altinn-app-frontend.css which contains the styling for app frontend. \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/\u0026lt;VERSIONNUMBER\u0026gt;/altinn-app-frontend.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Search for the filename (altinn-app-frontend.js or altinn-app-frontend.css) and replace the version number (e.g. 1) with the desired version number (e.g. 2).\nReminder: If you depend on a major version (e.g. 2), every minor and patch version of this major release will be applied automatically. If a specific version is defined (e.g. 2.0.0) the application will fetch this version until the reference is updated and no fixes or improvements will be fetched.\nDeployment Deployments are defined with helm-charts. The standard deployment setup is fetched from altinn-studios helm repository if you leverage the latest deployment strategy (recommended).\nIf you unsure if your app leverages the latest deployment strategy you can follow the migration guide here\nTo find the latest version of the standard helm-chart you can either check for the latest release of the chart deployment here or add the helm repo locally and search for available version with these commands:\n# Add the altinn-studio helm repo helm repo add altinn-studio https://charts.altinn.studio # Search for version of altinn-studio/deployment chart helm search repo -l altinn-studio/deployment If there is a new version of the helm chart check the changelog to see what\u0026rsquo;s new in this release.\nTo update to the new version update the dependency reference in deployment/Chart.yaml\napiVersion: v1 description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes name: deployment version: 1.1.0 dependencies: - name: deployment repository: https://charts.altinn.studio/ version: 2.8.0 \u0026lt;--- Update this "

	"description": "How to add dynamics?",
	"content": " ⚠️ Dynamics are under active development. The RuleHandler.js file will in the future be replaced by dynamic expressions. Currently only show/hide dynamics are supported using expressions, but calculation and validation will be supported in the future.\nIntroduction Dynamics are events that happen on the client side. These can be separated in two categories:\nCalculations - do calculations on the client side, and update the fields with new value. Show/hide fields - decide if fields should be hidden or displayed based on form values. Rules used for javascript-based dynamics can be added and changed directly in the RuleHandler file containing the rules.\n⚠️ Since we are moving more and more of this functionality over to dynamic expressions, the file RuleHandler.js is not a part of new apps as of 7th October 2024. If you do not find the file in the App/ui/form-folder, you can add it there. As a minimum, the file should contain the following:\nvar ruleHandlerObject = {}; var ruleHandlerHelper = {}; var conditionalRuleHandlerObject = {}; var conditionalRuleHandlerHelper = {}; There are two ways to add and change dynamics for an Altinn App:\nDirectly in Altinn Studio, in the app repository. Select \u0026ldquo;Open repository\u0026rdquo; in the profile menu for the app, and navigate to App/ui/form and open RuleHandler.js in the browser. In a local development environment by working in the file RuleHandler.js which can be found in the App/ui/form folder. All dynamics are written as JavaScript functions in the RuleHandler file. Functions that are defined in this file can be configured to run for selected fields in the app.\nThe dynamic code to show/hide fields or perform calculations should be set up so that it handles possible errors in the input gracefully. It should, for instance, handle empty fields or strings where you expect numbers without crashing. If the dynamic does not work as expected, take a look at the code that defines the dynamic and verify that it handles errors. NOTE: In order to support dynamics in older browsers the code defined in RuleHandler.js must be written in the version of ECMAScript that the given browser supports. For IE11 this is ECMAScript 5. Add or edit functions for dynamics There are two JavaScript objects in the file RuleHandler.js:\nruleHandlerObject - functions for calculations conditionalRuleHandlerObject - functions for hiding/showing fields It is in these objects the functions should be defined. In addition to these there are two helper objects (ruleHandlerHelper and conditionalRuleHandlerHelper), where you configure what input the different functions expect. This is done in order to be able to configure rules in Altinn Studio at a later point. To be able to configure dynamics in Altinn Studio the functions must be defined in the JavaScript objects (ruleHandlerObject or conditionalRuleHandlerObject), and the parameters they expect in the corresponding helper object.\nThe structure of the helper object:\nvar ruleHandlerHelper = { \u0026lt;name_of_rule\u0026gt;: () =\u0026gt; { return { \u0026lt;input_param\u0026gt;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;description\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026lt;input_param\u0026gt;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;description\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026lt;input_param\u0026gt;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;description\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ... }; } } The structure of objects containing the JavaScript functions:\nvar ruleHandlerObject = { \u0026lt;name_of_rule\u0026gt;: (\u0026lt;input_variable_name\u0026gt;) =\u0026gt; { // Do something here // Values from input parameters defined in // helper can be accessed through the object passed // into the rule, f.ex. // \u0026lt;input_variable_name\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;input_param\u0026gt; } } For instance, to create a rule that calculates the sum of two numbers (calculation) the following code is needed:\nvar ruleHandlerHelper = { sum: () =\u0026gt; { return { field1: \u0026#34;Field 1 in sum\u0026#34;, field2: \u0026#34;Field 2 in sum\u0026#34;, }; }, }; var ruleHandlerObject = { sum: (data) =\u0026gt; { // Check if data is available if (!data) return; // Check if value from input fields are available // If not, use value 0 in sum data.field1 = data.field1 ? data.field1 : 0; data.field2 = data.field2 ? data.field2 : 0; // return the sum return data.field1 + data.field2; }, }; Some default methods for calculations, with helper objects, are defined as part of the app template.\nMethod name Description Parameters Defined in object/helper sum Returns the sum of two values value1, value2 ruleHandlerObject/ruleHandlerHelper fullName Combines two strings (first name and last name) separated with a space. firstName, lastName ruleHandlerObject/ruleHandlerHelper lengthGreaterThan4 Returns true if the value is longer than 4 chars long. value conditionalRuleHandlerObject/conditionalRuleHandlerHelper Dynamics are run if a change has occurred in the input fields connected to the rule. The functions have to handle cases where, for instance, only one of the two parameters have defined values.\nAn example of how this could be done is shown in the sum-function below, where missing values are corrected to the value 0.\nvar ruleHandlerObject = { sum: (obj) =\u0026gt; { obj.value1 = obj.value1 ? +obj.value1 : 0; obj.value2 = obj.value2 ? +obj.value2 : 0; return obj.value1 + obj.value2; }, fullName: (obj) =\u0026gt; { return obj.firstName + \u0026#34; \u0026#34; + obj.lastName; }, }; var ruleHandlerHelper = { sum: () =\u0026gt; { return { value1: \u0026#34;Value 1\u0026#34;, value2: \u0026#34;Value 2\u0026#34;, }; }, fullName: () =\u0026gt; { return { firstName: \u0026#34;First name\u0026#34;, lastName: \u0026#34;Last name\u0026#34;, }; }, }; var conditionalRuleHandlerObject = { lengthBiggerThan4: (obj) =\u0026gt; { if (obj.value == null) return false; return obj.value.length \u0026gt;= 4; }, }; var conditionalRuleHandlerHelper = { lengthBiggerThan4: () =\u0026gt; { return { value: \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;, }; }, }; Configure dynamics for UI components Add the relevant UI components to the layout. In the right menu, select Regler for beregninger or Regler for vis/skjul felt. Select the wanted rule. Or add a function, as described in the sections above. Configure which field(s) that should be used as input for the function - this is fields in the data model. Select which component(s) should be affected by the rule (receive value or be shown/hidden) - these are components in the layout. For rules for hiding/showing elements several fields can be selected for the same rule. Save the configuration. Test that the rules works as expected. Existing configured rules is shown in the right menu, and can be edited/deleted.\nThe configuration can also be seen in the file App/ui/RuleConfiguration.json. This can be manually edited if necessary.\nExample usage of dynamics on an app Scenario:\nAn app with a UI has several fields for input. One of these fields is a radio button with the options \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo;. Depending on what the user selects, different content is to be displayed:\nYes: a new input field is shown, along with information about what should be entered. No: a different text with information is shown. This can be solved by adding the following in RuleHandler.js, either through Rediger dynamikk in Altinn Studio, or by manually editing the source code.\nvar conditionalRuleHandlerObject = { sjekkVirksomhetIDrift: (obj) =\u0026gt; { return obj.value \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.value === \u0026#34;Yes\u0026#34;; }, sjekkVirksomhetIkkeIDrift: (obj) =\u0026gt; { return !obj.value || obj.value != \u0026#34;Yes\u0026#34;; }, }; var conditionalRuleHandlerHelper = { sjekkVirksomhetIDrift: () =\u0026gt; { return { value: \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;, }; }, sjekkVirksomhetIkkeIDrift: () =\u0026gt; { return { value: \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;, }; }, }; Here, two functions have been added which checks if the value is \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; or not. After this code is added, the rules can be configured in studio. The results are displayed below:\nTest of dynamics example Dynamics in repeating groups It is also possible to add dynamics within a repeating group. This requires that the rule is configured in Altinn Studio as usual, and then manually doing some extra configuration in the App/ui/RuleConfiguration.json file as described below.\nFor each inputParams, {0} need to be added after the group part of the data binding. For instance model.group{0}.field. The index indicator will be replaced by the index for each relevant field in the repeating group. For each selectedFields (the fields affected by the rule), {0} needs to be added after the field ID, for instance layoutComponent{0} A new property must also be added to the rule, repeatingGroup. This object must contain the ID of the relevant group in the layout file. Here is an example of a rule that is configured for a repeating group:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ruleConnection\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;conditionalRendering\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;9f9f2a50-360b-11ea-b69a-8510e2e248b9\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;selectedFunction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lengthBiggerThan4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inputParams\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model.group{0}.field\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;selectedAction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Show\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selectedFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-field{0}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;second\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-other-field{0}\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;repeatingGroup\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;groupId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;the-group-id\u0026#34; } } } } } Nested repeating groups It is also possible to add dynamics for nested repeating groups. The configuration resembles that of a repeating group, but a second parameter childGroupId is added in the repeatingGroupobject, as well as an extra index indicator.\nExample:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ruleConnection\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;conditionalRendering\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;hide-nested-group-field\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;selectedFunction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;shouldHide\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inputParams\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;someGroup{0}.nestedGroup{1}.someField\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;selectedAction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hide\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selectedFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;the-component-id{0}{1}\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;repeatingGroup\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;groupId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;mainGroup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;childGroupId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;subGroup\u0026#34; } } } } } Example with more complex dynamics Scenario: An app has two sets of radiobuttons (yes/no) and a checkbox.\nWhen the app is loaded, only the first set of radiobuttons is visible. If the user selects Yes, the second set of radiobuttons is shown. If the user selects Yes in the second choice, the checkbox is shown. If the user goes back to the first set of radiobuttons and selects No, both the second set of radiobuttons and the checkbox are hidden. Alternative 1 This can be solved by configuring two different conditions for when the fields should be displayed:\nOne condition for the second set of radiobuttons Is shown if Yes is selected in the first set One condition for the checkbox Is shown if Yes is selected in both sets of radiobuttons. Example code that can solve this case:\nvar conditionalRuleHandlerObject = { showField2: (obj) =\u0026gt; { if (obj \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.field1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.field1 === \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) { return true; } return false; }, showField3: (obj) =\u0026gt; { if ( obj \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.field1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.field1 === \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.field2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.field2 === \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34; ) { return true; } return false; }, }; var conditionalRuleHandlerHelper = { showField2: () =\u0026gt; { return { field1: \u0026#34;Field 1\u0026#34;, }; }, showField3: () =\u0026gt; { return { field1: \u0026#34;Field 1\u0026#34;, field2: \u0026#34;Field 2\u0026#34;, }; }, }; Alternative 2 This can also be configured by using the same condition to show both the second set of radiobuttons and the checkbox. In addition, there needs to be a rule that removes the value from the second set of radiobuttons if the user selects No in the first set:\nvar ruleHandlerObject = { clearField: (obj) =\u0026gt; { if (obj \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.checkValue === \u0026#34;no\u0026#34;) { return \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; } return obj.currentValue; }, }; var ruleHandlerHelper = { clearField: () =\u0026gt; { return { checkValue: \u0026#34;check against this value\u0026#34;, currentValue: \u0026#34;the current value\u0026#34;, }; }, }; var conditionalRuleHandlerObject = { showField: (obj) =\u0026gt; { if (obj \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.checkField \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.checkField === \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) { return true; } return false; }, }; var conditionalRuleHandlerHelper = { showField: () =\u0026gt; { return { checkField: \u0026#34;check against this value\u0026#34;, }; }, }; Dynamics in PDF From Nuget versions 3.0.0 it is also possible to add dynamics for the PDF. This is done in the PDF Handler. The application must include the layout/ui/Settings.json file defined here.\u0026quot;/altinn-studio/v8/reference/logic/ux/pages/navigation/\nConfiguring dynamics in PDF is similar to how validations are added on the server side.\nIn the example below, if the string some-value is part of a value in the data model, the component with the ID 079f205b-c9ea-414d-9983-0d158e833e8a is hidden. The ID is reflected in the layout files.\npublic async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { if (data is Skjema) { Skjema skjema = (Skjema)data; if (skjema?.Innledninggrp9342?.Kontaktinformasjongrp9344?.KontaktpersonNavndatadef2?.value.Contains(\u0026#34;some-value\u0026#34;) == true) { layoutSettings.Components = new Components(); layoutSettings.Components.ExcludeFromPdf = new System.Collections.Generic.List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;(); layoutSettings.Components.ExcludeFromPdf.Add(\u0026#34;079f205b-c9ea-414d-9983-0d158e833e8a\u0026#34;); } } return await Task.FromResult(layoutSettings); } ``` "

	"content": "Siden er under konstruksjon\nEndringslogg Innledning På disse sidene vil du finne oversikt over alle API-tjenestene knyttet til autorisering og autentisering som finnes i Altinn 2 i dag. Vi har delt API opp i to ulike brukergrupper og du finner migreringsstrategi for de ulike API-enedpunktene der:\nTjenester for sluttbrukersystem Tjenester for tjenesteeiere i Altinn Ulike migrerings strategier for ulike API Som en hovedregel så vil alle eksisterende API i Altinn 2 fortsette å fungere så lenge Altinn 2 plattformen er i drift. Disse APIene vil som en hovedregel kun ha tilgang til informasjon fra Altinn 2 plattformen. Etterhvert som tjenesteeier flytter sine ulike tjenester ut fra Altinn 2, så vil det være begrenset om man får ut nødvendig informasjon fra APIene ettersom tjenestene forsvinner fra Altinn 2.\nFor API finnes 2 hovedstrategier i overgang mellom Altinn 2 og Altinn 3:\nAPI tjenesten videreføres ikke i den form den er og nye API må tas i bruk når tjenester som system er avhengig av flyttes fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3 Det tilbys proxy for Altinn 2 API-tjeneste som igjen kaller nye API i Altinn 3. Disse vil være tilgjengelig i en overgangsfase og slås av på senere tidspunkt. Disse APIene vil som en hovedregel kunne hente ut informasjon om tjenester fra både Altinn 2 eller Altinn 3 plattformen. Proxyer kan f eks kreve at konsument må åpne brannmurer eller endrer adresse for kall som gjøres mot API. Noen nye API vil være forholdsvis enkelt å ta i bruk og vil kreve lite endring i systemer som bruker APIene. Men det vil også være tilfeller hvor nye API-tjenester endres mye og hvor det kreves større tilpasninger i systemer som konsumerer API. I disse tilfellene vil vil beskrive hva endringene går ut på under beskrivelse av strategi for de ulike API-tjenestene. SOAP tjenester videreføres ikke Altinn 2 tilbyr i dag API på både SOAP og REST. Det er besluttet at man som en hovedregel ikke vil videreføre SOAP grensesnitt på Altinn 3 plattformen. Alle som i dag benytter SOAP må derfor forberede seg på at de er nødt til å gå over til REST.\nVi anbefaler de som i dag benytter SOAP å vente med å ta i bruk REST til nye REST-API er tilgjengelig i Altinn 3.\nAutentisering via Maskinporten blir innført for alle API i Altinn 3 Alle REST-api i Altinn 3 vil benytte Maskinporten som autentiseringsmekanisme. Det vil ikke være mulig å benytte virksomhetssertifikatpålogging direkte mot Altinn 3 REST-api, slik man har mulighet til i Altinn 2.\nHva skjer med REST api for Sluttbrukersystem? Disse APIene kan benyttes for å integrere fagsystemer mot Altinn som benyttes hos sluttbrukere. Disse fagsysteme kan typisk være regnskapssystem, HR system, landbrukssystem, post/arkiv system eller lignende.\nFor å benytte disse APIene trengs en pålogget bruker som gir fagsystemet tilgang til å hente data på deres vegene i Altinn. Her finner du migreringsplaner for sluttbrukersystem-API.\nHva skjer med REST api for Tjenesteeier? Disse APIene kan kun benyttes av offentlige virksomheter som har avtale om bruk av Altinn.\nDet er tjenesteeier som autentiseres i kall mot API og kan hente ut informasjon om brukers fullmakter. Tjenesteeier kan kun hente ut informasjon om bruker som er nødvendig for å kunne utføre offentlig myndighetsutøvelse/tjenesteyting. Her finner du migreringsplaner for tjenesteeeier-API.\n"

Once assigned, they can utilize these rights for machine-to-machine communication with Altinn without needing further authorization from the organization.\nEnterprise Users in Altinn 3 In Altinn 3, enterprise users can be used via API.\nThis involves a two-step process: first, authenticate the organization using Maskinporten. Then, combine the username and password with the machine port for certificate authentication and exchange the machine port token with the username and password.\nAdministration of enterprise users is documented here.\nLogin and token exchange are documented here.\nA Postman example is available here.\nFurther use with the Altinn App API and Platform API is similar to using an Altinn token based on an ID port session.\nTransition to System Users Support for enterprise users is expected to end in 2026 along with Altinn 2.

	"title": "Dynamic expressions",
	"tags": ["dynamics", "translate-to-english"],
	"description": "Overview of dynamic expressions defined in JSON",
	"content": " ⚠️ Dynamic behaviour is an area under active development. This functionality is currently available as a beta feature in Altinn Studio and offers limited configuration options. The UI only allows to build expressions with one level of nesting, meaning an unlimited number of un-nested expressions can be combined using either the OR or AND operator. However, the tool allows to edit more complicated expressions by freestyle writing. Currently the tool is also limited to connecting expression to boolean component fields. See Expressions in Altinn Studio on how to use Altinn Studio to configure an expression.\nIntroduction Dynamic expressions enable the definition of simple dynamic behavior in an Altinn 3 app, such as defining whether a form field should be shown or hidden, whether the field should be required or read-only.\nThese expressions are available in all Altinn 3 apps that use frontend version 3.54.0 or later. By using this version or the latest major version, you can use dynamic expressions for several use cases.\nStarting from version 7.2.0 of the nuget packages the expressions are also supported in the backend. This means that the server will be able to evaluate the expressions and remove data upon submission that is potentially stored in the data model and is associated with fields/components that are later hidden. Note that this only applies to data in the data model that is associated with hidden components - data in the data model that is not associated with components (and is thus implicitly hidden from the user) will not be automatically removed.\nIt also makes it possible to omit submitting data that is otherwise associated with required fields - if these required fields are hidden in the form using dynamic expressions. This also applies when submitting directly from the API.\nNote: Note that automatic removal of hidden data must currently be manually activated (opt-in) by adding the following line to App/appsettings.json after upgrading the nuget packages to 7.2.0 or later:\nv8 \u0026#34;AppSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;OpenIdWellKnownEndpoint\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://localhost:5101/authentication/api/v1/openid/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;RuntimeCookieName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AltinnStudioRuntime\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;RegisterEventsWithEventsComponent\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;RemoveHiddenData\u0026#34;: true }, v7 \u0026#34;AppSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;OpenIdWellKnownEndpoint\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://localhost:5101/authentication/api/v1/openid/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;RuntimeCookieName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AltinnStudioRuntime\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;RegisterEventsWithEventsComponent\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;RemoveHiddenDataPreview\u0026#34;: true }, From version 8.9.0 onwards, it is possible to mark components with the \u0026quot;removeWhenHidden\u0026quot; property, which is an expression that is evaluated together with \u0026quot;hidden\u0026quot; when we remove hidden data. It can be true, false, or null (or an expression that evaluates to one of these). For the time being, it only makes sense to set \u0026quot;removeWhenHidden\u0026quot;: false (because true and null results in the same behaviour), but in the future we may remove data when it is true even if no global RemoveHiddenData setting is configured in appsettings.\nStructure and syntax Structure and syntax:\nThe expressions are built up as a kind of mini-programming language, where everything is defined in JSON. The expressions themselves are always a list (array) of values, where the first value in each list is always a function name. The rest of the values are sent as input/arguments to the function.\n[\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;] In the example above, the strings \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo; are compared. They are different, so the result of this expression is a boolean value; false.\nThis function, equals, expects to receive two strings as input/arguments. It is also possible to give it another expression as the second argument. If you do this, the expression will be interpreted so that the innermost functions are executed first, and the outermost ones are executed last\n[\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;firstName\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;] In this example, the innermost expression/function call [\u0026ldquo;component\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;firstName\u0026rdquo;] is executed first. If the value of the \u0026ldquo;firstName\u0026rdquo; component is equal to the string \u0026ldquo;John\u0026rdquo;, the function returns the boolean value \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you then use this expression for the hidden property of a component, the component will be hidden if you enter \u0026ldquo;John\u0026rdquo; in the \u0026ldquo;firstName\u0026rdquo; component elsewhere in the application:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lastName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;firstName\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;John\u0026#34;] } ```json There are no limitations on how large/deep the expressions can be. As an exercise, see if you can read what this expression does, and what possible values it can return: ```json [ \u0026#34;if\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;greaterThanEq\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;], 16], [ \u0026#34;if\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;lessThan\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;], 62], \u0026#34;Please consider applying for our open position!\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;else\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;concat\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;At \u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;, you are eligible for retirement\u0026#34;] ], \u0026#34;else\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;concat\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;At \u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;, you should stay in (pre)school\u0026#34;] ] Vis/skjul innhold Spoiler Alert: Click here for an interpretation of the above expression The expression checks the value of a hypothetical component with ID \u0026ldquo;age\u0026rdquo;.

Invalid expressions will give a warning in the JavaScript console in the browser when the page loads, so it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to have this console open when developing an application and testing expressions locally.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s also possible to test the execution of an expression directly in the developer tools. This is done by pressing Ctrl + Shift + K (or Cmd + Shift + K on Mac) and navigating to the expression tab. Expressions may behave differently depending on the component they are evaluated near. Therefore, you can also select a component to be used as context when evaluating the expression in the developer tools.\nVis/skjul innhold Example of IDs and Evaluation in Repeating Groups Note: This describes some implementation details in app-frontend-react and is only relevant when testing an expression in the developer tools that depends on a known position in a repeating group. This may change in the future, and such changes will not affect expressions defined in an application. The context is retrieved from where the expression is defined in the layout file.\nImagine a repeating group for people with two fields: name and age. Given the following expression:\n[\u0026quot;component\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;age\u0026quot;]\nWhat will the age be? It may vary depending on which group evaluates the expression. If there are two groups/rows, both the name and age components will exist twice. These will have IDs name-0 and age-0 (for the first row) and name-1 and age-1 (for the second row).\nImagine the following data is filled in a repeating group:\nName Component ID Age Component ID Per name-0 24 age-0 Kari name-1 36 age-1 Ola name-2 18 age-2 Given the following expression:\n[\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;] And with these assumptions:\nNo context has been given (or the expression is placed on a component that is not near an age component) The expression is evaluated in the context of name-0 The expression is evaluated in the context of name-1 What will the result be in the different examples? Here are the answers:\nThis will find the \u0026ldquo;first and best\u0026rdquo; age component and thus find age-0. It therefore returns 24, Per\u0026rsquo;s age. Here, we try to search in the context of the name component on the first row, and again we find 24, Per\u0026rsquo;s age. In the last example, we have specified the second row in the repeating group by evaluating in the context of name-1. Here we find the closest age component age-1, which is 36, Kari\u0026rsquo;s age.

In the frontend, this function is available in version 4.17.0 and above, including the latest rolling release. The compare function is a generic comparison function that can be used to compare two values. The function takes three or four arguments. The first and last arguments are always the values to compare. The arguments in the middle must be a valid operator, optionally preceded by a not to invert the comparison.\nSome examples:\n[\u0026#34;compare\u0026#34;, 5, \u0026#34;greaterThan\u0026#34;, 3] [\u0026#34;compare\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;] [\u0026#34;compare\u0026#34;, 5, \u0026#34;not\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, 3] The function returns a boolean value based on the comparison. The accepted data types for comparison depend on the operator used. For example, the operator equals can compare strings, numbers, and booleans, while greaterThan and lessThan can only compare numbers.\nOperator Parameters Description equals Any type Returns true if the two values are equal, false otherwise. greaterThan Number Returns true if the first number is greater than the second number, false otherwise. greaterThanEq Number Returns true if the first number is greater than or equal to the second number, false otherwise. lessThan Number Returns true if the first number is less than the second number, false otherwise. lessThanEq Number Returns true if the first number is less than or equal to the second number, false otherwise. isBefore Date/time Returns true if the first date is before the second date, false otherwise. isBeforeEq Date/time Returns true if the first date is before or equal to the second date, false otherwise. isAfter Date/time Returns true if the first date is after the second date, false otherwise. isAfterEq Date/time Returns true if the first date is after or equal to the second date, false otherwise. isSameDay Date/time Returns true if the two dates are on the same day, false otherwise. Vis/skjul innhold equals / notEquals These two functions compare two strings to check if they are equal (equals) or not equal (notEquals). If you send in values other than strings, the values are converted and compared as strings (read more about conversion here).\nExamples:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lastName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.FirstName\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;Ola\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;notEquals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;frontendSettings\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;FormIsEditable\u0026#34;], true ] } notEquals is essentially the same as, and a shortcut to, [\u0026quot;not\u0026quot;, [\u0026quot;equals\u0026quot;, ...]].\nSee also tips and tricks under String or less string comparison?\nVis/skjul innhold not This function takes in a boolean value or something that can be converted to a boolean value and returns the opposite boolean value. True becomes false, false becomes true.\nThe function can be useful if you want to invert an expression. Instead of thinking about writing an expression that hides a component given certain conditions, you can wrap the expression in not and write the expression based on what is needed to show the component:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lastName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;not\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;or\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ShowLastName\u0026#34;], [\u0026#34;frontendSettings\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ShowAllFields\u0026#34;]] ] } Vis/skjul innhold greaterThan / greaterThanEq / lessThan / lessThanEq These 4 functions expect two input numbers and compare whether the first is compared with the second. That is, for the function greaterThan, the expression is true if the first number is greater than the second.\nFunction Description Symbol greaterThan Is the first number greater than the second number? \u0026gt; greaterThanEq Is the first number greater than or equal to the second number? ≥ lessThan Is the first number less than the second number? \u0026lt; lessThanEq Is the first number less than or equal to the second number? ≤ If any of the arguments to these functions are null, the result will be false (regardless of whether it is the first or second argument).\nExample checking if age is over (or equal to) 18:\n[\u0026#34;greaterThanEq\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;alder\u0026#34;], 18] Vis/skjul innhold concat This function takes 0 or more strings as arguments and returns a string where all the strings in the arguments are concatenated. If the function is called without any arguments, it returns an empty string.\nNote that the function doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically add spaces or commas when concatenating strings. To provide a more readable result, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to add dashes where necessary:\n[\u0026#34;concat\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Congratulations on your \u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;th birthday!\u0026#34;] The expression above gives the text Congratulations on your 18th-birthday! if the value in the age component was 18.\nIn the concat-function, null-values are interpreted as empty strings. Boolean values are output as the strings \u0026ldquo;true\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;false\u0026rdquo;.\nVis/skjul innhold and / or The functions and and or expect 1 or more boolean values and produce a result based on whether all or at least one of the values were true (true).\nFunction Description and Are all the arguments true? (true) or Is at least one of the arguments true? (true) Providing null values will interpret them as false (false). Examples of usage can be found under String or smaller string comparison?\nVis/skjul innhold if The if function can be used to branch an expression so that the return value is controlled by the result of another boolean expression. The function can be called in two different ways: with 2 or 4 arguments:\nArgument Alternative 1 Alternative 2 First argument Boolean Boolean Second argument Any type Any type Third argument The string \u0026quot;else\u0026quot; Fourth argument Any type In alternative 1, the return value of the function will be the value given as the second argument if the first argument is true (true). If not, it returns the value null.\nIn alternative 2, the return value of the function will be the value given as the second argument if the first argument is true (true). If not, it returns the value given in the fourth argument. You must always provide the string \u0026quot;else\u0026quot; as the third argument if you want to call the function with 4 arguments. The third argument is only there to make the expression more readable and serves no other function.\nIf you want more conditions and possible return values, you can nest multiple if calls inside the second or fourth argument:\n[ \u0026#34;if\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;greaterThan\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;birthYear\u0026#34;], 1945], \u0026#34;You were born after the World Wars\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;else\u0026#34;, [ \u0026#34;if\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;greaterThanEq\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;birthYear\u0026#34;], 1939], \u0026#34;You were born during World War II\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;else\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;You were born before World War II\u0026#34; ] ] Vis/skjul innhold language The function language returns the user\u0026rsquo;s selected language code.\nExample:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lastName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;equal\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;language\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;], } If the current language is unknown, nb will be returned, which is the default language for Altinn 3 apps. Therefore, you can be confident that this function always returns a valid language.\nNote: This function is not yet available in backend code. Consequently, it will generate an error message if used in places where expressions run on the backend, and if the functionality to automatically delete hidden data (RemoveHiddenDataPreview) has been enabled.\nVis/skjul innhold startsWith/endsWith The startsWith function checks if the string provided as the first argument starts with the string given in the second argument. Similarly, the endsWith function checks if the first string ends with the second string.\n[\u0026#34;startsWith\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.FirstName\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;Jo\u0026#34;] [\u0026#34;endsWith\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.FirstName\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;hn\u0026#34;] Some important details about these functions:\nAll functions start and end with an empty string, so startsWith and endsWith will always return true if using an expression like [\u0026quot;startsWith\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;...\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;\u0026quot;]. This is crucial to consider when using the value of a component or a lookup in the data model as the second argument. No strings start or end with a null value. If an expression like this is used: [ \u0026#34;startsWith\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.FullName\u0026#34;], [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.FirstName\u0026#34;] ] the result will always be false as long as the first name is not provided. However, as mentioned earlier, if the first name is set to an empty string (for example, if the user has erased their first name), the expression will return true if a full name is set. To avoid some of this behavior, you can use the if function together with equals to check if something is set to an empty string. [\u0026quot;startsWith\u0026quot;, null, null] always returns false. Vis/skjul innhold stringLength The function stringLength returns the length of a string (in number of letters/characters), including spaces.\nExample:\n[\u0026#34;stringLength\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.FirstName\u0026#34;]] If the string is null, stringLength will return 0.\nVis/skjul innhold stringIndexOf This function is only available on the backend when using nuget packages version 8.6.0-preview.3 or later. In the frontend, this function is available in version 4.17.0 and above, including the latest rolling release. The function stringIndexOf takes two arguments: a string and a substring. It returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring in the string. If the substring is not found, the function returns null.\nExample:\n[\u0026#34;stringIndexOf\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.FullName\u0026#34;], \u0026#34; \u0026#34;] This example returns the index of the first space in the full name. If the full name is \u0026ldquo;John Doe\u0026rdquo;, the function will return 4.\nVis/skjul innhold stringSlice This function is only available on the backend when using nuget packages version 8.6.0-preview.3 or later. In the frontend, this function is available in version 4.17.0 and above, including the latest rolling release. The function stringSlice takes a string as the first argument (the subject string) and one or two numbers as the second and third arguments (the start index and optional length). It returns a substring of the subject string starting at the index given in the second argument. If a third argument is provided, the substring will be of the length given in the third argument.\nExample:\n[\u0026#34;stringSlice\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.FullName\u0026#34;], 5, 3] This example returns a substring of the full name starting at the 5th character and with a length of 3. If the full name is \u0026ldquo;John Doe\u0026rdquo;, the function will return \u0026ldquo;Doe\u0026rdquo;.\nVis/skjul innhold stringReplace This function is only available on the backend when using nuget packages version 8.6.0-preview.3 or later. In the frontend, this function is available in version 4.17.0 and above, including the latest rolling release. The function stringReplace takes three arguments: a string, a substring to replace, and a replacement string. It returns a new string where all occurrences of the substring in the string are replaced with the replacement string.\nExample:\n[\u0026#34;stringReplace\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.FullName\u0026#34;], \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34;-\u0026#34;] This example replaces all spaces in the full name with dashes. If the full name is \u0026ldquo;John Doe\u0026rdquo;, the function will return \u0026ldquo;John-Doe\u0026rdquo;.\nVis/skjul innhold contains / notContains These two functions check whether string A includes or does not include string B. Both contains and notContains are case-sensitive. This means that the string \u0026ldquo;Hei\u0026rdquo; does not include \u0026ldquo;hei\u0026rdquo;. If you want to compare regardless of case, you can use the functions lowerCase or upperCase along with contains or notContains.\nExample:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lastName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;contains\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.FirstName\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;J\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;notContains\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.FirstName\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;D\u0026#34; ] } If you want to check for values in a comma-separated list, you can use the function commaContains.\nVis/skjul innhold commaContains The function commaContains takes two arguments. The first argument is a comma-separated string, and the second argument is the string you want to check if it\u0026rsquo;s among the comma-separated values in the first argument.\nExample:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;addName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;commaContains\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.Names\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;Ola\u0026#34;] } Note that any spaces before/after commas or before/after the first value are ignored. This function is particularly useful in cases where you use a component that stores multiple values in a comma-separated string, such as Checkboxes and MultipleSelect.\nVis/skjul innhold lowerCase/upperCase The functions lowerCase and upperCase take a string as input and return a new string where all characters are converted to lowercase or uppercase, respectively.\n[\u0026#34;lowerCase\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.LastName\u0026#34;]] These functions provide a simple way to convert between lowercase and uppercase letters within a string. One use case could be combining one of these functions with other comparison functions so that the comparisons are done regardless of whether uppercase or lowercase letters were used in the input value.\n[\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;upperCase\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.LastName\u0026#34;]], \u0026#34;SMITH\u0026#34;] Vis/skjul innhold lowerCaseFirst/upperCaseFirst These functions are only available on the backend when using nuget packages version 8.6.0-preview.3 or later. In the frontend, these functions are available in version 4.17.0 and above, including the latest rolling release. The functions lowerCaseFirst and upperCaseFirst take a string as input and return a new string where the first character is converted to lowercase or uppercase, respectively.\n[\u0026#34;upperCaseFirst\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Model.LastName\u0026#34;]] In this example, given a last name of \u0026ldquo;smith\u0026rdquo;, the function will return \u0026ldquo;Smith\u0026rdquo;.\nVis/skjul innhold round The function round rounds a number to an integer or, optionally, to a decimal number with a configurable number of decimal places.\nExample of rounding to 2 decimal places:\n[\u0026#34;round\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;122.99843\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;] Example of rounding to the nearest integer:\n[\u0026#34;round\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.4999\u0026#34;] The return value from this function is a string, allowing it to be used for display purposes (note that the decimal separator is always a period). Even though the return value is a string, it can also be used further in expressions that expect numeric input.\nVis/skjul innhold text The function text takes a key as an argument and uses this key to retrieve the corresponding text from a text resource. The function returns the value associated with the specified key.\nExample:\n[\u0026#34;text\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;min-nøkkel-id\u0026#34;] Note: Remember to manually test with text keys that contain variables. It\u0026rsquo;s not guaranteed that these will work as expected.\nNote: This function is not yet available in backend code. Therefore, it will generate an error message if used in places where expressions run on the backend, and if the functionality to automatically delete hidden data (RemoveHiddenDataPreview) has been enabled.\nVis/skjul innhold displayValue The function displayValue looks up a component and returns a formatted text string representing the value in the data model. This differs from the component function, which returns the raw value in the data model. This function is best suited for displaying a component\u0026rsquo;s value to the user and less for further logic based on the returned value. This is particularly relevant for Input fields with number formatting, date fields, radio buttons (and other components with code lists), etc.\nExample:\n[\u0026#34;displayValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;component-id\u0026#34;] Note: This function is not yet available in backend code. Therefore, it will generate an error message if used in places where expressions run on the backend, and if the functionality to automatically delete hidden data (RemoveHiddenDataPreview) has been enabled.\nVis/skjul innhold instanceContext (lookup) This function allows retrieving information about the current instance. The following keys can be used as the first argument:\nKey Value Example Value instanceId Current instance ID 512345/48c31ffc-dcdd-416d-8bc7-194bec3b7bf0 instanceOwnerPartyId Current actor ID 512345 instanceOwnerPartyType Type of actor owning instance \u0026quot;org\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;person\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;selfIdentified\u0026quot;, or \u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot; appId ID of the active app org/app-name All these lookups will return a value of null if working in a stateless context. Using keys other than those listed above will result in an error message. This behavior is unique among lookup functions to ensure that information not (yet) exposed via a key here is not attempted to be retrieved from the instance. Provide feedback if you wish to retrieve instance data not available in this function.\nThe lookup is performed in the same data source available for language/texts.\nVis/skjul innhold frontendSettings (lookup) This post allows retrieving information from a data source that can be controlled differently for each runtime environment.\nThe lookup is performed within the same data source available for language/texts, and the setup is detailed there.\nNote: The data source is named applicationSettings when used in language/texts, but the values must always be stored under the key FrontEndSettings in appsettings.{environment}.json. For this reason, the function has been named frontendSettings here to indicate that lookups cannot be performed in the rest of appsettings.{environment}.json.\nVis/skjul innhold countDataElements (lookup) This function is only available on the backend when using nuget packages version 8.6.0-preview.3 or later. In the frontend, this function is available in version 4.17.0 and above, including the latest rolling release. This function allows counting the number of elements of a given data type in the current instance. The first argument must be a string that is defined as a data type in applicationmetadata.json. The function will return the number of elements of the given data type in the current instance.\nFor example, if you have a FileUpload component uploading files to the Attachment data type, you can use this function to count the number of attachments currently uploaded. Likewise, you can count the number of subform elements by referencing the data model id.\nExample:\n[\u0026#34;countDataElements\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Attachment\u0026#34;] Vis/skjul innhold dataModel (lookup) This lookup function enables retrieving values directly from the current data model. The first and only argument must point to a location in the data model and uses the same dot-separated format as used in dataModelBindings. When used within repeating groups, there\u0026rsquo;s no need to use placeholders for indexes within the group - the expression automatically finds the relative position within the context of a repeating group.\nPlease note that lookups only function against data types already supported in the expressions. If one looks up an object or a list/array in the data model using the dataModel function, the result will always be null. This functionality may change, as there are plans to support objects and lists in the expressions in the future.\nExample of lookup within a repeating group:\n[ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;employees\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Employees in the company\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 99999, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;employee-name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;employee-age\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Employees\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;employee-name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Full Name\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Employees.Name\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;lessThan\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Employees.Age\u0026#34;], 18] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;employee-age\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Age\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Employees.Age\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Employees[0].Name\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;Ola Nordmann\u0026#34;] } ] The following observations can be made:\nThe first lookup (to control hidden on the component employee-name) is governed by the age of each employee. If the employee is under 18 years old, employee-name is hidden. Note that the same path in the data model is used as simpleBinding on employee-age.\nThe second lookup (to control hidden on the component employee-age) uses [0] in the data model lookup. This also works, but the behavior might be unexpected; here, all age components are hidden if the name of the first employee is Ola Nordmann.\nVis/skjul innhold component (lookup) Direct lookups on a component are, in many ways, similar to lookups in the data model using dataModel. An expression that looks up the value of a component will search for the component and return the value stored in its simpleBinding in the data model. Currently, no other values are supported besides the one stored against simpleBinding (if other values are desired, one must directly access dataModel).\nHowever, a lookup on a component will return null if the component whose value is being looked up is hidden (even if the component otherwise has associated data in the data model). This, to some extent, allows controlling the display of a component based on whether another component is visible or not. If the component is found on a completely different (yet hidden) page, the lookup also yields null, even if the data model has a value associated with the component.\nSimilar to dataModel, lookups on a component ID will attempt to find the component in the vicinity of the expression within the context of repeating groups. It will first search for the component in the current row before looking up through the page structure.\nVis/skjul innhold formatDate This function is only available on the backend when using nuget packages version 8.6.0-preview.3 or later. In the frontend, this function is available in version 4.0.0 and above, including the latest rolling release. The formatDate function takes a date as its first argument, and a format as its second argument. The format argument is an optional string that supports some tokens in Unicode Tokens.\nThese are the tokens we support:\nUnit Token Result Era G..GGG BC, AD Era GGGG Before Christ, Anno Domini Era GGGGG B, A Year y 44, 1, 1900, 2017 Year yy 44, 01, 00, 17 Year yyy 044, 001, 1900, 2017 Year yyyy 0044, 0001, 1900, 2017 Extended year u -43, 0, 1, 1900, 2017 Extended year uu -43, 01, 1900, 2017 Extended year uuu -043, 001, 1900, 2017 Extended year uuuu -0043, 0001, 1900, 2017 Month M 1, 2,\u0026hellip;, 12 Month MM 01, 02,\u0026hellip;, 12 Month MMM Jan, Feb, \u0026hellip;, Dec Month MMMM January, February, \u0026hellip;, December Day of month d 1, 2, \u0026hellip;, 31 Day of month dd 01, 02, \u0026hellip;, 31 Day of week E..EEE Mon, Tue, Wed, \u0026hellip;, Sun Day of week EEEE Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, \u0026hellip;, Sunday Day of week EEEEE M, T, W, \u0026hellip;, S AM/PM a a.m., p.m. Hour [1-12] h 1, 2, \u0026hellip;, 11, 12 Hour [1-12] hh 01, 02, \u0026hellip;, 11, 12 Hour [0-23] H 1, 2, \u0026hellip;, 22, 23 Hour [0-23] HH 01, 02, \u0026hellip;, 22, 23 Minute m 1, 2, \u0026hellip;, 59 Minute mm 01, 02, \u0026hellip;, 59 Second s 1, 2, \u0026hellip;, 59 Second ss 01, 02, \u0026hellip;, 59 Fractional second S 0, 1, \u0026hellip;, 9 Fractional second SS 00, 01, \u0026hellip;, 99 Fractional second SSS 000, 001, \u0026hellip;, 999 If the format argument is not provided, the function will use a default format that varies by language.\nAs with all dates/times, they will be converted to the local timezone when a timezone offset (or UTC) has been provided. For this reason, expressions evaluated on the frontend and the backend may differ when the local timezone in the browser is different from the local timezone in the backend.\nExample:\n[\u0026#34;formatDate\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;2023-10-30T14:54:00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;HH:mm\u0026#34;] Would result in 14:54\nVis/skjul innhold linkToPage The linkToPage function can be used to create links that can be used inside text in a form. It is meant to create links that point to a specific page of the form. Clicking this link will navigate directly to the specified page.\nThe function takes 2 arguments. The first argument is the link text which will be visible for the user. The second argument is the id of the page the link should point to.\n[\u0026#34;linkToPage\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Specify your name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;page1\u0026#34;] Would result in \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;#/instance/\u0026lt;party-id\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;instance-id\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;TaskId\u0026gt;/page1\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Specify your name\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; When clicked, this link will take the user to the specified page.\nVis/skjul innhold linkToComponent The linkToComponent function can be used to create links that can be used inside text in a form. It is meant to create links that point to a specific component of the form. Clicking this link will navigate directly to the component, giving it focus.\nThe function takes 2 arguments. The first argument is the link text which will be visible for the user. The second argument is the id of the component the link should point to.\n[\u0026#34;linkToComponent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Specify your name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inputMyName\u0026#34;] Would result in \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;#/instance/\u0026lt;party-id\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;instance-id\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;TaskId\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;PageId\u0026gt;?focusNodeId=inputMyName\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Specify your name\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; When clicked, this link will take the user to the page the component is on and focus on the specified component.\nVis/skjul innhold optionLabel The optionLabel function can be used to retrieve the text/label of an option in a code list. The text will automatically be translated to the user\u0026rsquo;s selected language (if the label is a text resource), so there is no need to pass the result through the text function.\nThe function takes 2 arguments. The first argument is the code list id, and the second argument is the code list value to find in the code list.\n[\u0026#34;optionLabel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;countries\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;no\u0026#34;] Make sure the code list id is a plain string, and not a nested expression. The code value however, can be a nested expression, i.e. look up from a path in the data model.\nIf no matching code list value is found, the function will return null.\nVis/skjul innhold argv The argv function can be used to retrieve arguments sent to the expression. This is currently only available for expression-based validation.\nThe function takes 1 argument, which is the index of the argument you want to retrieve. The index starts at 0.\n[\u0026#34;argv\u0026#34;, 0] Vis/skjul innhold value Like argv, the value function is also a method for retrieving arguments sent to the expression. The function can be used without arguments to retrieve a value, or with an argument to retrieve other types of values. This is currently available for filtering of options and will soon be available as an alternative to argv in expression-based validation.\n[\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;] This expression retrieves the value of the option (if used in filtering options). In other contexts, this expression currently returns an error message.\n[\u0026#34;value\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;] The expression above retrieves the text of the option (if used in filtering options). In other contexts, this expression returns an error message.\nData Types Expressions in the functions expect that the arguments sent in have a specific type. If an argument sent in has a different type than expected, the value is attempted to be converted to the correct type. For instance, the function equals expects two strings, but if you send in the boolean value true as either argument, it works fine too because the boolean value true is converted to the string \u0026quot;true\u0026quot;.\n[\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, true, \u0026#34;true\u0026#34;] The expression above works and yields true as a result (because true and \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; are compared as the same value by converting true to \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; before comparison). This also allows calling a function that returns one datatype and, for example, comparing it with a completely different datatype. Read more about which datatypes can be converted to what below.\nAll functions expecting a specific datatype as an argument will also function if you send in null. However, in some cases, using a null value may result in an error message – for instance, attempting to look up in the data model with [\u0026quot;dataModel\u0026quot;, null]. In the concat function, however, a null value is interpreted as an empty string.\nStrings Strings contain arbitrary text and are a broad datatype that can be converted from numbers and boolean values.\nSome strings can also be converted to other datatypes:\nString Value Can Substitute Examples Integers with or without negative signs Number 3, -8, 71254 Decimal numbers with or without negative signs Number 3.14, -33.0, 123.123 true or false with lowercase or uppercase Boolean true, True, FALSE null with lowercase or uppercase Null null, Null, NULL All other strings not listed in the table above will result in an error if attempted to be converted to other types.\nNumbers Numeric values refer to positive and negative integers and decimal numbers. Some strings are also automatically converted to a numeric value, as shown in the table for strings above. For a string to be successfully converted to a number, the string must meet the following criteria:\nThe string contains only a number, with no other text before or after it. A negative sign (-) can be used, but a positive sign (+) is not supported. Decimal numbers must be represented with a period, not a comma. Thousands separators or other number formatting are not supported. All other strings will result in an error if attempted to be converted to a number. Attempting to convert a boolean value to a number will also result in an error.\nFunctions expecting a numeric input can also receive null. See more about its impact in the description of each function.\nBoolean Values Boolean values include true (true) and false (false). When calling a function expecting a boolean value, certain other types can also be passed, which are converted to a boolean value:\nThe numbers 1 and 0 function as true and false, respectively. The strings \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;0\u0026quot; function similarly to the numbers (and become true and false, respectively). The strings \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;false\u0026quot; are also converted to a boolean value. The value null functions like false. All other values will result in an error if passed to a function expecting a boolean value. Note that these rules differ slightly from the rules for strings. Thus, there is a difference between values that can be interpreted as a boolean value for a function expecting a boolean argument and values that are equal to a boolean value. The function equals compares values as strings, so the number 1 and the string \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; will be considered equal, but it will not recognize 1 and true as equal values.\nIt might appear that the following expressions are similar:\n\u0026quot;hidden\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;dataModel\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hideName\u0026quot;] \u0026quot;hidden\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;equals\u0026quot;, [\u0026quot;dataModel\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hideName\u0026quot;], true] \u0026quot;hidden\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;if\u0026quot;, [\u0026quot;dataModel\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hideName\u0026quot;], true, \u0026quot;else\u0026quot;, false] If the value (here obtained from the lookup [\u0026quot;dataModel\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hideName\u0026quot;]) is true or \u0026quot;true\u0026quot;, the component will be hidden. However, if the value is 1 or \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, the component will only be hidden with expressions in options 1 and 3. This is because the result in the hidden expression is converted to a boolean value, and if expects a boolean value as the first argument. However, equals compares the values as strings, and \u0026quot;1\u0026quot; is not equal to \u0026quot;true\u0026quot;.\nAlso, see tips and tricks under String or not a string comparison?\nNull Most places where a string, number, or boolean value is expected should also handle a null value. Null values indicate that a specific value is missing, and there is a difference between a null value, an empty string, and the number 0.\nIf you perform a lookup in a function like dataModel, and the value you are searching for is not found/set, usually null will be the result.\nDates Dates can be strings (or DateTime/DateOnly in the C# data model). Only certain date/time formats are accepted in expressions when parsed from a string, as allowed by ISO 8601 (e.g., 2023-10-30T14:54:00.000Z).\nSome examples of valid date strings:\n2023-10-30T14:54:00.000Z (UTC timezone) 2023-10-30T14:54:00.000+02:00 (with timezone offset) 2023-10-30T14:54:00.000 (assumed to be in the local timezone) 2023-10-30T14:54:00 (assumed to be in the local timezone, without milliseconds) 2023-10-30 (Date only, assumed to be midnight in the local timezone) 2023 (Year only, assumed to be midnight January 1st in the local timezone) It is important to note that dates including a timezone offset (or Z for UTC) are converted to the local timezone when used in expressions. This means that using the formatDate function to format a date might yield different results on the frontend and backend if the timezone on the server is different from the user\u0026rsquo;s timezone in the browser.\nFor this reason, it may be preferable to specify dates and times without a timezone offset or Z if you want the date/time to be displayed the same way regardless of the user\u0026rsquo;s timezone. Likewise, when comparing dates, it is recommended to only compare dates in the same timezone.\nTips and Tricks Show/Hide Entire Pages Expressions can be used to show/hide entire pages. In the example below, the entire page will be hidden if a component (on one of the other pages) has the value no or is not set.\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;or\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hasComplaints\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;no\u0026#34;], [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hasComplaints\u0026#34;], null] ], \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ ... ] } } If the page you are on is hidden, the application will automatically move to the next available page in the page order. If all the next pages are hidden, the first possible page in the order will be displayed instead.\nString or smaller String Comparison? The way expressions are evaluated might seem strict (for example, 0 and null are considered different values when compared with equals). This is a design choice made in Altinn for two reasons:\nStrict rules are clear rules. The expressions are more likely to provide an error message if something is not as expected rather than leaving you wondering why things turned out the way they did. If the expressions treat many different values as equal, it takes away your ability to differentiate between them if you want to. If a less-strict comparison is desired, one can construct an expression using the or function to recognize several different values:\n[ \u0026#34;or\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Path\u0026#34;], 0], [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Path\u0026#34;], false], [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Path\u0026#34;], null], [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Path\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;\u0026#34;] ] Additionally, note that conversion to boolean value allows for more alternatives than strings (as expected by equals). Given that the or function expects boolean values as arguments, and the values 0, false, and null are already accepted as boolean values, the following will function similarly to the expression above:\n[\u0026#34;or\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Path\u0026#34;], [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;dataModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;My.Path\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;\u0026#34;]] "

	"description": "How to integrate External API data into your Altinn application.",
	"content": "Available from v8.2.8 Introduction The External API feature allows you to integrate data from External APIs into your Altinn application. This is useful when you need to display or process data from external sources within your application. The feature works by implementing the IExternalApiClient interface and registering your implementation in the application\u0026rsquo;s service container. When implemented, the external api data can be accessed through expressions (see the Expressions documentation) or other classes in your application.\nHow it works To use the External API feature, you need to:\nCreate a class that implements the IExternalApiClient interface Register the implementation in the Program.cs file under RegisterCustomAppServices The IExternalApiClient interface requires you to implement:\nAn Id property that uniquely identifies your External API client A GetExternalApiDataAsync method that returns the data from the External API The GetExternalApiDataAsync method can return any object (but not primitives), allowing you to structure the returned data according to your needs.\nImplementation example App/logic/ExternalApiTestClient.cs public class ExternalApiTestClient : IExternalApiClient { public string Id =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;externalApiTestId\u0026#34;; public async Task\u0026lt;object\u0026gt; GetExternalApiDataAsync( InstanceIdentifier instanceIdentifier, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; queryParams = null ) { var mockData = new[] { new { schemaTitle = \u0026#34;Pantopplysninger for TRANBY OG RØDEBERG REGNSKAP\u0026#34;, href = \u0026#34;https://example.com/mock1\u0026#34;, date = DateTime.Now.ToString(\u0026#34;dd.MM.yyyy\u0026#34;) }, new { schemaTitle = \u0026#34;Panteopplysninger for MADELENE NYRUD\u0026#34;, href = \u0026#34;https://example.com/mock2\u0026#34;, date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-1).ToString(\u0026#34;dd.MM.yyyy\u0026#34;) }, new { schemaTitle = \u0026#34;Panteopplysninger for MADELENE NYRUD\u0026#34;, href = \u0026#34;https://example.com/mock3\u0026#34;, date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-2).ToString(\u0026#34;dd.MM.yyyy\u0026#34;) }, new { schemaTitle = \u0026#34;Registerutskrift for TRANBY OG RØDEBERG REGNSKAP\u0026#34;, href = \u0026#34;https://example.com/mock3\u0026#34;, date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-2).ToString(\u0026#34;dd.MM.yyyy\u0026#34;) }, new { schemaTitle = \u0026#34;Registerutskrift for MADELENE NYRUD\u0026#34;, href = \u0026#34;https://example.com/mock3\u0026#34;, date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-2).ToString(\u0026#34;dd.MM.yyyy\u0026#34;) }, new { schemaTitle = \u0026#34;Ektepakt\u0026#34;, href = \u0026#34;https://example.com/mock3\u0026#34;, date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-2).ToString(\u0026#34;dd.MM.yyyy\u0026#34;) }, new { schemaTitle = \u0026#34;Registerutskrift fra Løseøreregisteret\u0026#34;, href = \u0026#34;https://example.com/mock3\u0026#34;, date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-2).ToString(\u0026#34;dd.MM.yyyy\u0026#34;) } }; return mockData; } } In this example, we\u0026rsquo;re returning mock data, but in a real implementation, you would typically use an HttpClient to make HTTP requests to an External API.\nRegistering the External API client After implementing the IExternalApiClient interface, you need to register your implementation in the Program.cs file:\nApp/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { // Register your External API client services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IExternalApiClient, ExternalApiTestClient\u0026gt;(); // Other custom services }\nAccessing data from the External API in your application The External API feature is primarily designed to be used through expressions in your Altinn application. This allows you to display data from external sources or implement conditional logic based on external data directly in your forms and layouts.\nAccessing External API data through dynamic expressions To access data from your External API client in expressions, you can use the externalApi function. This function requires two parameters:\nclientId: The ID of your External API client pathToProperty: A dot notation path to the property you want to access from the returned object [\u0026#34;externalApi\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;externalApiTestId\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0.schemaTitle\u0026#34;] This expression will return the schema title of the first item in the array returned by the GetExternalApiDataAsync method of the External API client with the ID \u0026ldquo;externalApiTestId\u0026rdquo;.\nThe pathToProperty parameter uses dot notation to navigate through the object structure. For example:\n\u0026quot;0\u0026quot; accesses the first element of an array \u0026quot;items.0.title\u0026quot; accesses the title property of the first element in the items array \u0026quot;data.user.name\u0026quot; accesses the name property of the user object within the data object Examples of using External API data in expressions Displaying external data You can use the External API data to display information in your form:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;externalDataText\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Text\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;concat\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Document title: \u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;externalApi\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;externalApiTestId\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0.schemaTitle\u0026#34;] ] } } Conditional visibility based on external data You can also use External API data to control the visibility of components:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;conditionalInput\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;equals\u0026#34;, [\u0026#34;externalApi\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;externalApiTestId\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;length\u0026#34;], 0] } This will hide the component if the External API returns an empty array.\nFor more information about expressions and how to use them in your Altinn application, see the Expressions documentation.\nAccessing the data through the API Endpoint The data fetched through the External API implementation is also available through a REST API endpoint. The endpoint follows this pattern:\n{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId:int}/{instanceGuid:guid}/api/external/{externalApiId} Where:\n{org} is the organization code (e.g. \u0026ldquo;ttd\u0026rdquo;) {app} is the application name (e.g. \u0026ldquo;my-app\u0026rdquo;) {instanceOwnerPartyId:int} is the party ID of the instance owner {instanceGuid:guid} is the unique identifier of the instance {externalApiId} is the ID of the External API client (the value returned by the Id property) For example, to access the \u0026ldquo;externalApiTestId\u0026rdquo; External API for a specific instance, you would use:\nhttps://ttd.apps.altinn.no/ttd/my-app/instances/50001337/b2572673-5afa-4a23-9c4e-db2cb0f8a9c9/api/external/externalApiTestId You can also pass query parameters to the endpoint, which will be forwarded to the GetExternalApiDataAsync method:\nhttps://ttd.apps.altinn.no/ttd/my-app/instances/50001337/b2572673-5afa-4a23-9c4e-db2cb0f8a9c9/api/external/externalApiTestId?param=value Security Warning: Never include sensitive information such as National Identity Numbers or other personal identifiers in query parameters. Query parameters can be logged in server logs, appear in browser history, and may be cached by proxies. For accessing data from Folkeregisteret or other sensitive sources, always use secure methods like retrieving the identifier from the instance data or using post requests with encrypted payloads. The response will be the JSON representation of the object returned by the GetExternalApiDataAsync method.\nExample: Implementing a real External API client App/logic/WeatherApiClient.cs public class WeatherApiClient : IExternalApiClient { private readonly HttpClient _httpClient; private readonly ILogger\u0026lt;WeatherApiClient\u0026gt; _logger; private readonly IConfiguration _configuration; public WeatherApiClient( HttpClient httpClient, ILogger\u0026lt;WeatherApiClient\u0026gt; logger, IConfiguration configuration) { _httpClient = httpClient; _logger = logger; _configuration = configuration; // Configure the HTTP client _httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(\u0026#34;https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/\u0026#34;); _httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(\u0026#34;Accept\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;application/json\u0026#34;); } public string Id =\u0026gt; \u0026#34;weatherApi\u0026#34;; public async Task\u0026lt;object\u0026gt; GetExternalApiDataAsync( InstanceIdentifier instanceIdentifier, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; queryParams = null) { try { // Get the API key from configuration var apiKey = _configuration[\u0026#34;WeatherApi:ApiKey\u0026#34;]; if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(apiKey)) { _logger.LogError(\u0026#34;Weather API key not found in configuration\u0026#34;); return new { Error = \u0026#34;API key not configured\u0026#34; }; } // Add API key to header instead of query string for better security _httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(\u0026#34;X-Api-Key\u0026#34;, apiKey); // Build the query string var query = new Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; { { \u0026#34;q\u0026#34;, queryParams?.GetValueOrDefault(\u0026#34;location\u0026#34;) ?? \u0026#34;Oslo\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;days\u0026#34;, queryParams?.GetValueOrDefault(\u0026#34;days\u0026#34;) ?? \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; } }; var queryString = string.Join(\u0026#34;\u0026amp;\u0026#34;, query.Select(kv =\u0026gt; $\u0026#34;{kv.Key}={Uri.EscapeDataString(kv.Value)}\u0026#34;)); // Make the API call var response = await _httpClient.GetAsync($\u0026#34;forecast.json?{queryString}\u0026#34;); // Check if the request was successful if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode) { // Parse and return the response var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); return JsonSerializer.Deserialize\u0026lt;JsonDocument\u0026gt;(content); } else { // Handle error response var errorContent = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); _logger.LogError($\u0026#34;Weather API returned error: {response.StatusCode}, {errorContent}\u0026#34;); return new { Error = $\u0026#34;Weather API returned error: {response.StatusCode}\u0026#34; }; } } catch (Exception ex) { // Handle exceptions _logger.LogError($\u0026#34;Error calling Weather API: {ex.Message}\u0026#34;); return new { Error = \u0026#34;Failed to call Weather API\u0026#34; }; } } } Register this client in Program.cs:\nvoid RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { // Register the Weather API client services.AddHttpClient\u0026lt;WeatherApiClient\u0026gt;(); services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IExternalApiClient, WeatherApiClient\u0026gt;(); // Other custom services } Example: Using External API with Maskinporten To use External APIs that require Maskinporten authentication, you need a Maskinporten client with access to the necessary scopes for the API you want to integrate:\naltinn:serviceowner (if you are a service owner) Any other scopes required by the specific API you are integrating with To set this up, you can follow the general steps in the Maskinporten Integration Guide with some modifications described below.\nThe External API client needs a Maskinporten client to communicate with protected APIs. The configuration object typically looks like this:\nApp/appsettings.json \u0026#34;MaskinportenSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Authority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://[test.]maskinporten.no/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ClientId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your-client-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;JwkBase64\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;base64-encoded-jwk\u0026#34; } If you need a different configuration path, you can configure it using ConfigureMaskinportenClient:\nApp/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices( IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env ) { services.ConfigureMaskinportenClient( \u0026#34;YourUniqueMaskinportenSettingsPath\u0026#34; ); } You can register the Maskinporten client on the HttpClient class that needs it in Program.cs by using the extension method UseMaskinportenAuthorization: App/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices( IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env ) { services.AddHttpClient\u0026lt;WeatherApiClient\u0026gt;().UseMaskinportenAuthorization(\u0026#34;scope:1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope:2\u0026#34;); } If you need Maskinporten for authorization against another Altinn application, you need an Altinn token. To get it, you can use UseMaskinportenAltinnAuthorization: App/Program.cs void RegisterCustomAppServices( IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config, IWebHostEnvironment env ) { services.AddHttpClient\u0026lt;WeatherApiClient\u0026gt;().UseMaskinportenAltinnAuthorization(\u0026#34;scope:1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope:2\u0026#34;); } Security considerations When implementing an External API client, consider the following security aspects:\nAuthentication: Ensure that your External API client authenticates properly with the External API. This might involve using API keys, OAuth tokens, or other authentication mechanisms.\nData protection: Be careful about what data you send to and receive from the External API. Avoid sending sensitive data unless necessary, and validate all incoming data.\nError handling: As shown in the example above, handle errors gracefully to prevent exposing sensitive information to end users.\nRate limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent overloading the External API and to comply with any usage limits imposed by the API provider.\nTroubleshooting Here are some common issues you might encounter when implementing External API and how to resolve them:\nExternal API data not showing up in the UI If your External API data is not appearing in your UI components:\nCheck your implementation: Ensure your IExternalApiClient implementation is returning the data you expect. Verify registration: Make sure your client is properly registered in Program.cs. Check expressions: Verify that your expressions are referencing the correct ID for the External API client and correct dot notation to the property you want to extract. Inspect network requests: Use browser developer tools to check if the API endpoint is being called and what response it returns. Check logs: Look for any errors in your application logs related to the External API client. Authentication issues with external services If you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble authenticating with external services:\nCheck credentials: Verify that your API keys, tokens, or other credentials are correct and not expired. Inspect request headers: Ensure authentication headers are being properly set in your requests. Check environment: Make sure you\u0026rsquo;re using the correct environment settings (dev, test, prod) for the external service. Verify scopes: For Maskinporten, ensure you have the correct scopes configured for the APIs you\u0026rsquo;re trying to access. "

Loadbalancer is responding with HTTP Error 504 - timeout This occurs when the loadbalancer is not getting a response from the other services running in kubernetes. Because the loadbalancer is not updated when the deployment of new versions or altinn-designer, altinn-runtime or altinn-repositories. To delete a pod, first find the name of the running pod:\nkubectl get pods Then use the whole name, and run the following command:\nkubectl delete pod [POD_NAME] Sonarqube-code-analysis pipeline fails on pull request This occurs when there exists double line shifts in the code that is being analyzed. This somehow crashes the sonarqube code analysis tool. To solve this issue you need to identify and remove the double line shift is in the code:\nNavigate to the pipeline logs, open \u0026lsquo;Run Code Analysis\u0026rsquo; Scroll to the bottom Look for error message looking like \u0026lsquo;ERROR: 1 is not a valid line offset for pointer\u0026rsquo; The error should contain info at where the double line shift is Remove the double line shift and update PR Pod is stuck in status ContainerCreating and has warning \u0026ldquo;Unable to mount volumes for pod XXX: timeout expired waiting for volumes to attach or mount for pod XXX\u0026rdquo; The storage we use today don\u0026rsquo;t support two pods accessing it at the same time, so on deploy if the first pod don\u0026rsquo;t release the storage before the other one tries to connect to it the second pod will get stuck in ContainerCreating status. If you then run kubectl get pods and get the name of the pod you can then run\nkubectl describe [POD_NAME] then you see the message \u0026ldquo;Unable to mount volumes for pod XXX: timeout expired waiting for volumes to attach or mount for pod XXX\u0026rdquo;\nTo fix this you need to delete the deployment to that pod and start a new release:\nkubectl delete deployment [DEPLOYMENT_NAME] To start a new release go to release pipeline\nI try to pull master from github and get error \u0026ldquo;Cannot lock ref\u0026rdquo; This happens from time to time, still unsure why.

Det betyr at alle brukere som i dag har tilgang til en ekstern lenketjenester på vegne av en aktør vil beholde disse delegeringene etter at tjenestene er flyttet.\nKonsekvenser for tilhørende API Det vil bli laget nye API for å hente ut informasjon om brukers rettigheter på vegne av andre. Dette er API som i dag brukes av alle tjenesteeiere som har opprettet lenketjenster og som bruker Altinn som tilgangsstyringsløsning på deres egen tjensteplattform.\nAutotorisasjonsAPI i Altinn 2 for tjenesteeier vil ikke inneholde informasjon om lenketjenester som er flyttet fra A2 til A3. Tjenesteeiere kan derfor ikke flytte sine ressurser før de er klar til å ta i bruk nye API for autorisasjon i Altinn 3. Beskrivelse av de nye APIene for tjenesteeiere finnes i swagger. Denne er fortsatt under arbeid.\nDet vil i en overgangsfase være mulig for sluttbrukersystem å benytte de gamle API-ene på REST og SOAP. Beskrivelse av de nye APIene for sluttbrukersystem finnes i swagger. Denne er fortsatt under arbeid.\nKonsekvenser for Lokale roller i Altinn 2 Lokale roller fungerer i dag kun for tjenester som finnes på Altinn 2 plattformen. Vi har undersøkt utbredelse og bruk av disse og ser at funksjonaliteten er tatt i bruk av svært få virksomheter. I tillegg tror vi behovet for lokale roller vil forsvinne når man innfører nye tilgangspakker i Altinn 3.\nDet er derfor tatt en beslutning om at man ikke vil videreføre lokale roller i Altinn 3, men at vi inntill videre lar de lokale rollene som er opprettet og i bruk bestå. I praksis betyr dette at etterhvert som flere og flere tjenester migreres fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3 så vil de lokale roller ha færre og færre tjenester de gjelder for.\nTidsplan Oppstart utvikling: 01.01.2023 Klart for migrering av lenketjenester: Q2 2024 Migrering må være gjort innen: 18. juni 2026 (tidligere migrering anbefales, support avsluttes 31. mai) Samtykketjenester Migreringsstrategi Det er ikke bestemt om tjenester av typen \u0026ldquo;Samtykke\u0026rdquo; skal flyttes èn og èn fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3 eller om det skal gjøres i èn operasjon.\nAlle samtykker som finnes for disse tjenestene vil bli tatt vare på og flyttet samtidig med tjenesten fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3.

Det betyr at alle systemleverandører som før hadde rettighet til å bruke \u0026ldquo;Delegerbare API ressurser\u0026rdquo; på vegne av sine kunder vil beholdt disse delegeringene etter at tjenestene er flyttet.\nDelegerbare API ressurser vil bli \u0026ldquo;resourcetype\u0026rdquo; av typen \u0026ldquo;MaskinportenSchema\u0026rdquo; i Altinn 3.\nKonsekvenser for tilhørende API Etter at tjenestene er flyttet er det ikke lenger mulig for tjenesteeiere å opprette nye Delegerbare API ressurser via dagens grensesnitt. Nye grensesnitt for dette vil bli gjort tilgjengelig i Altinn 3 i løpet av 2023 Tjenesteeiere som ønsker å opprette nye tjenester av typen \u0026ldquo;Delegerbare API ressurser\u0026rdquo; må inntill videre sende epost til support@altinn.no og be Digdir om å opprette/redigere disse på deres vegne.\nDet er laget nye API for å hente ut informasjon om hvilke delegeringer som foreligger. Dette er API som i dag brukes av Maskinporten, Norsk Helsenett og SKatteetaten. I en overgangsfase være mulig å benytte de gamle API-ene i Altinn 2. Dato for når vi slår av disse APIene i Altinn 2 er ikke bestemt\nInformasjon om tjenestene vil etter flytting kunne slås opp her:\nTestmiljø- tt02 Produksjonsmlijø - altinn.no API for delegering slås av I dag er det mulig for sluttbrukere å benytte API for å slette eller opprette delegeringer til Delegerbare API-ressurser; se API-beskrivelse. I forbindelse med migrering av disse ressursene fra Altinn 2 til Altinn 3 vil det i en overgangsfase ikke lenger være mulig å utføre dette via API.

	"content": " Eksempel-repository for tjenesten \\\u0026#34;Starte Enkeltpersonforetak\\\u0026#34; \u0026ldquo;Altinn Repositories\u0026rdquo; er en frittstående Git versjonskontroll og Application Lifecycle Management-løsning, som både Designer, kodeeditorer og andre eksterne verktøy vil benytte som back-end og felles sted for å lagre og versjonere tjenestene som utvikles.\nRepositories har et GitHub-lignende brukergrensesnitt og både Git og REST-baserte tekniske grensesnitt.\nGit muliggjør at flere verktøy kan jobbe mot samme tjeneste-repository Det vil være en omfattende jobb å forsøke å utvikle en Git + ALM løsning på egen hånd, ref. all funksjonaliteten som behøves.\nHeldigvis finnes det flere open source \u0026ldquo;GitHub-kloner\u0026rdquo; som vi kan benytte, og blant dem virker Gitea å være mest lovende (uttales som /ɡɪ’ti:/ - \u0026ldquo;gitty\u0026rdquo;). Bilder fra Gitea benyttes som eksempler videre i denne dokumentasjonen.\nFunksjonalitet i \u0026ldquo;Repositories\u0026rdquo; Repositories inneholder et repository med versjonerte filer for hver 3.0-tjeneste. Eksempel på typer filer som en \u0026ldquo;3.0-tjeneste\u0026rdquo; vil kunne bestå av er kode, tester, web-komponenter, layouts og stiler, oversettinger, arbeidsflyt og konfigurasjon.\nRepositories vil tilby funksjonalitet rundt den enkelte 3.0-tjeneste, og eksponere funksjonaliteten via både brukergrensesnitt og et REST-API som er en klone av GitHub sitt v3 API-format. Dette er positivt da det finnes andre verktøy som også støtter dette API-formatet, og da det kan forenkle det å kunne erstatte Gitea som back-end med andre liknende Git-systemer.\n3.0 Tjeneste Repository som representerer en \u0026ldquo;3.0-tjeneste\u0026rdquo;, aka app, og inneholder alle filer som tjenesten består av.\nHver utgave av en tjeneste vil leve i sin egen mappe, slik at ett repository kan inneholde èn eller flere utgaver av den samme tjenesten.\nRepository management Håndtering av repositories er en kjerneaktivitet, da hver tjeneste som utvikles vil lagres i sitt eget repository.\nCreate/delete repository Link to repository Rename repository Fork repository Muliggjør at man kan ha et \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo;-repository med felles tjenester som flere andre kan benytte, slik som dagens \u0026ldquo;master-tjenester\u0026rdquo; bare mye kraftigere Muliggjør også at utviklere kan lage som egen kopi og teste ut nye muligheter og løsninger på sitt eget område uten å påvirke originalen List repositories Download/upload files Download repo Create files and folders Read/edit files Rename files Delete files View raw file Link to file Opprette et nytt repository Enkelt å opprett fork Ny fork av en tjeneste Dokumentering Det er viktig å ha god støtte for å dokumentere tjenestene man utvikler, slik at det vil være enkelt for andre personer på teamet å bidra. Det er derfor ønskelig å ha innebygd Wiki-funksjonalitet med støtte for å editere i markdown, slik som i Altinn docs og AltinnPedia.\nWiki Add/edit/delete pages Markdown editing Link to specific wiki page Support for other external wikis Emojis Markdown editing Preview Fullscreen Side-by-side Wiki Versjonering Hver eneste fil som en 3.0-tjeneste består av skal ha full versjonshistorikk, uavhengig av om man jobber mot filene via Designer eller eksternt og distribuert/lokalt i en kodeeditor på egen maskin. Repositories sitt versjonskontrollsystem, som er basert på Git, er laget nettopp med tanke på dette.\nVersion history of all files, artifacts, code and configuration Link to each change with a unique id Link to each changed file Link to who did the change Highlight the last change done in the repository Time of change Comments/messages Diff between versions Versjonshistorikk for hver eneste fil Diff for hver eneste fil i nettleser En utvikler kan se samme diff og versjonshistorikk lokalt i sin egen editor Release management En svært viktig egenskap når man utvikler programvare (noe som 3.0-tjenester er) er å kunne tagge ulike versjoner, og kunne gå tilbake og teste eller patche en tidligere versjon hvis man ønsker det. Det er også viktig å kunne se alt som har endret seg mellom versjonene.\nSiden Git benyttes for versjonering, så vil en release/tag som opprettes peke på en eksakt versjon av hver eneste fil som en 3.0-tjeneste består av, og man kan enkelt se hva som er endret.\nCreate tags for the 3.0 app Link to tags Create/delete releases Link to releases Marking of pre-releases Time of release creation User that triggered the release Download zipped files of release Browse content of a given tag/release Releases som er opprettet for en 3.0-tjeneste Man kan enkelt browse repository \\\u0026#34;tilbake i tid\\\u0026#34; QA En QA-prosess for godkjenning av endringer basert på branching og pull requests, vil for større teams kunne være mulig. Dette er i tråd med hvordan programvare utvikles, inkludert selve Altinn.\nBacklog management Som for all annen programvareutvikling, så vil hver 3.0-tjeneste typisk ha en egen backlog med bugs, forbedringer, fremtidige features, etc. som tjenesteutviklerne vil jobbe mot. Dette er en sentral del av Application Lifecycle Management.\nCreate/close issues pr. 3.0 app Time of creation Who Filter issues by open/closed Add labels Filter issues by label Assign to milestone Filter issues by milestone Assign to user Filter issues by assignee Markdown editing Discussions Add files to issue Notifications when issues change Issues search List issues Backlog med issues Issue eksempel Milepæler er en fin måte å sette scope for fremtidige releaser, og se fremgang Labels gjør det enkelt å kategorisere og filtrere issues Org management Organisasjoner er tjenesteeiere, men i 3.0 er det ikke noe i veien for at brukere også kan utvikle tjenester. I en organisasjon så kan man gi tilganger til brukere, og man kan opprette teams med tilgang til en eller flere 3.0-tjenester.\nDet å håndtere organisasjonen, som alt annet, skal være 100% selvbetjent.\nCreate/delete organisations Name/shortname URL Logo List organisations Link to organisation Create repository for organisation ref. repository management Add/remove teams in organisation List teams in organisation Add/remove users in organisation List all users in organisation Add/remove users in teams List users in teams Liste over organisasjoner Repositories tildelt team ENK Innstillinger for team ENK Brukerstyring Brukerne i denne sammenheng er tjenesteutvklerne. Det å håndtere organisasjonen skal være helt selvbetjent.\nAdd/remove users Name Avatar Add/remove users to/from teams \u0026ldquo;Starring\u0026rdquo; of favorite repositories List of user repositories (including forks) Activity log for user Workspace for user (dette er veldig viktig, betyr at tjenesteutviklere kan \u0026ldquo;leke seg\u0026rdquo; på sitt eget område) I første omgang (MVP) vil tjenesteeier (org-admin) legge til alle sine brukere i gruppen \u0026ldquo;owner\u0026rdquo; slik at de får tilgang til å opprette repositories (tjenester). Gruppen \u0026ldquo;owner\u0026rdquo; gir vide fullmakter på organisasjonsnivå (dvs tjenesteeiernivå), så på sikt vil det implementeres mer granulert tilgangsstyring.\nEn ny tjenesteutvikler har fått skrivetilgang Tjenesteutviklere har egen profil og aktivitetslogg Søke Søk er viktig for å finne frem, og skal være bygd inn i løsningen.\nRepositories Issues Edits Users Organisations Søk med sortering Tilgangsstyring Det skal være mulig å styre tilgang til repositories, les/skriv/admin, teams, brukere, samt opprette private repos.\nAccess to 3.0 apps (read/write) Access to orgs Users access Private/public app-repos Administrator AM/AD-integration API access Gitea tilbyr API med swagger Trigge hendelser I dagens hverdag, med bruk av Slack og andre systemer ifbm. utvikling, så er det viktig at \u0026ldquo;Repositories\u0026rdquo; kan trigge hendelser i andre systemer, f.eks. poste til en Slack-kanal når en endring skjer i en 3.0-tjeneste.\nTrigger events at org-level Trigger events at 3.0 app-level WebHook mot Slack Logge inn Tjenesteutviklere og andre interessenter skal kunne logge inn og få tilgang til organisasjoner og 3.0-tjenester.\nLogin page CAPTCHA?

	"content": "Authorization rules are defined in accordance to the XACML 3.0 standard. The rules will define the conditions that must be met in order to give a certain user access to perform one or more steps of an application defined work process.\nMake sure you know what you are doing! The owner of the service is responsible for creating authorization rules and choosing the right roles that grant access to protected information. Although the XACML standard gives the developer great freedom to define rules and choose the roles they want, these guidelines must be followed to ensure that the particular user access to the application is correct and works as intended.\nIn order to make the right choices for creating authorization rules for you app you need an overall understanding of how Altinn Authorization works and how it is used to control access. At this page you can read more about Altinn Authorization.\nRoles must be chosen with care! In the authorization configuration file, roles are used to define who is allowed to perform which actions. Altinn offers a set of roles required as a condition to access a specific step in the workflow and information displayed.\nBefore choosing which role to use, make sure you have sufficient understanding of what these roles mean and what kind of services and information this role is expected to have access to. It is important that authorization rules and the choice of roles match the intentions and expectations of the administrator for the party. For example, the administrator probably expects that the role \u0026ldquo;Tax\u0026rdquo; gives access to services related to, for example, tax reporting, but simultaneously needs to avoid any role giving access to services within payroll and the personnel area. Similarly, please be careful about using, for example, the role \u0026ldquo;Contact Person\u0026rdquo; from the Entity Register to grant access to services - unless the basis for using this role has been thoroughly evaluated.\nDo NOT change authorization rules after production launch Changes to authorization rules after a production release will render existing users unable to access the service and must have the new role delegated and any previous role deleted. This will impose an unexpected administrative burden on businesses that will use the service because they will then have to clean up delegations made based on the old policy. Such a practice will usually result in dissatisfied users of the application.\nContact us - we will gladly provide assistance As application owner you must always consider if the intentions in the description of the role are consistent with the service or access to data that your application provides.\nGiving wrong people access to data they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have is never good marketing for your service and we therefore strongly suggest you contact Altinn for guidance in choosing roles and setting up authorization rules if you have the slightest doubt. Authorization rules must be tested Authorization rules, like everything else, must be tested before the application is launched to verify that the correct roles have access to the necessary data.\nAltinn can impose changes to the authorization rules Although it is the application owner\u0026rsquo;s responsibility to construct the correct authorization rule and select the correct roles, Altinn will supervise or carry out spot checks with the authorization rules for services that are put into production. If we discover what we consider incorrect use of Altinn Authorization, we may choose to intervene and remove the service from production or impose changes in the authorization rules.\nRoles used in AltinnThis page contains information about the types of roles Altinn has that can be used to grant access to an application\nTesting authorization rulesTesting authorization rules is important before going to production to verify that the chosen rules work as intended and provide a secure and user-friendly experience\n"

See an overview of packages and categories. Altinn Role A Altinn role is a relationship between organizations and organizations, organizations and persons, and persons and persons. The relationships exist because ER roles implicitly give them through or users have explicitly delegated them. Altinn will discontinue Altinn Roles from the solution in 2026 Policy A policy contains rules for accessing an app or a resource. The app developer or resource owner defines it. Altinn uses XACML as a policy format. Read more about the policy format. Rule A rule defines different operations on resources / apps. Delegation A delegation is when a user gives rights to a person, system, or organization. A delegation gives rights through delegated roles, delegated access Packages, or delegated single rights through a delegation policy. Delegation Policy A policy created by end-users when they delegate rights to other users/organizations. Resource A resource is metadata about a digital or analog service that a resource owner wants to use Altinn Authorization for access control. When defining a service as a resource in Altinn Resource Administration with a policy, resource owners can use Altinn PDP to control access to external solutions. Access List An access list defines entities that can access a resource if the resource requires access list access. Altinn Register Term Description Party Can be a organization, person or self identifed entiy. Identifed by PartyUid or PartyId. Defined by Altinn Organization Organization from entity register. Organizations offers roles to persons and other organizations. Person Person from folkeregister. SelfIdentifedUser Created in Altinn by user that does not have a identity number in Norway. Altinn Studio Term Description App An application is created in Altinn Studio. App Repository The app repository is the source control repository where the source code and configuration for an Altinn app is stored. A new repo is created for each app created in Altinn Studio. The repos located in Gitea under the org that owns the app. Example repos for Finanstilynets apps Org Short for organisation. Organisation is the entity responsible for an app. Typically identified by an unique acronym, e.g. SKD, NAV, OSLK. See full list of Altinn orgs here Altinn Events Term Description Events An event is a lightweight notification message containing information about a single operation or state change for a specified entity. Each event is published by a single originator, referred to as the event publisher or source, on behalf of a single person, organization or asset, known as the subject. The operation or state change is referred to as the event type. Read more about Events Subscription A subscription let a event subscriber tell Altinn Events what type of events he is interested in.

This object contains metadata about the specific instance. If you want to learn more about the instance and the affiliated API, you can read the technical documentation about this under API.\nSub status As an app-owner you can set a sub status for the instance. This gives the end user more information about the current state of the instance. The sub status is displayed both in the Altinn message box and on the receipt page.\nThe sub status is an object which can be set in the instance object. How this is done is described under API. Sub status is a simple object which contains label and description. These fields can either contain plain text, or a text key that refers to the application texts. It is worth noting that variables in text are not supported for these texts. In the message box, label is displayed in its entirety if it contains 25 symbols or fewer. If label contains more that 25 symbols, only the first 22 symbols will be displayed and \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; will be added to the end.\nExample of a status object:\n{ \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Description in clear text\u0026#34; } Below you see an example of how sub status looks like in the message box and in the receipt where the sub status is set up in the following way:\n{ \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Accepted\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Your application has been accepted by the king.\u0026#34; } Substatus in message box Substatus in receipt Automatic deletion of drafts As an application owner you may want to delete a user\u0026rsquo;s draft after a certain period of time. To achieve this, three steps are required:\nConfigure the application to allow the service owner to delete instances. Identify which instances are incomplete by querying storage. Delete the instance through an exposed endpoint within the application. Step 1: Configure the application Service owners are by default not allowed to delete instances. To get the required permissions, a rule must be added to policy.xml in App/config/authorization. The rule can be copied from our rule library.\nStep 2: Identify incomplete instances by sending a request to storage Storage exposes a set of query parameters which can be used to retrieve a set of instances. The example below retrieves all non-submitted instances of an application that was instantiated on the 30th of September 2020 or earlier.\nYou can experiment with query parameters for your service here:\nHTTP GET https://platform.altinn.no/storage/api/v1/instances?appId={org}/{app}\u0026amp;created=lte:2020-09-30\u0026amp;process.currentTask=Task_1\nStep 3: Delete instance through endpoint exposed in the application After identifying the instances that are to be deleted, you can send a call with the instance ID (instanceOwner.partyId/instanceGuid) to the application to delete them.\nHTTP DELETE https://ttd.apps.altinn.no/ttd/apps-test/instances/{instanceOwner.partyId}/{instanceGuid}\n"

IInstantiationProcessor - create customized prefill data, this is described in the prefill chapter. Custom validation rules for instantiation Validation rules for instantiation can include validating a time to specific user instructions and complex tests that require external API calls.\nExample 1 - Instantiation only allowed before 3 pm on any given day namespace Altinn.App.Logic; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Models.Validation; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; public class InstantiationValidatorExample1 : IInstantiationValidator { public Task\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult?\u0026gt; Validate(Instance instance) { DateTime now = DateTime.Now; if (now.Hour \u0026lt; 15) { return new InstantiationValidationResult() { Valid = false, Message = \u0026#34;ERROR: Instantiation not possible before 3PM.\u0026#34; }; } return null; } } In Program.cs the service must be registrered by\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;IInstantiationValidator, InstantiationValidatorExample1\u0026gt;() Example 2 - Instantiation only allowed for application owner To limit instantiation to a given entity, in this case the application owner, you need to inject extra services for usage in the validation implementation.\nTo validate the instantiation, you can check one of two claims in the context. Either the organization\u0026rsquo;s three-letter abbreviation or the organization number. The example below uses the organization abbreviation.\nTo validate based on organization number you can follow the example below, and replace AltinnCoreClaimTypes.Org with AltinnCoreClaimTypes.OrgNumber.\nnamespace Altinn.App.Logic; using System.Security.Claims; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Models.Validation; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; using AltinnCore.Authentication.Constants; using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http; public class InstantiationValidatorExample2 : IInstantiationValidator { private readonly ClaimsPrincipal _user; public InstantiationValidatorExample2(IHttpContextAccessor contextAccessor) { _user = contextAccessor.HttpContext!.User; } public async Task\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult?\u0026gt; Validate(Instance instance) { var result = new InstantiationValidationResult(); string org = string.Empty; if (_user.HasClaim(c =\u0026gt; c.Type == AltinnCoreClaimTypes.Org)) { Claim? orgClaim = _user.FindFirst(c =\u0026gt; c.Type == AltinnCoreClaimTypes.Org); if (orgClaim != null) { org = orgClaim.Value; } } if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(org) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; org.Equals(\u0026#34;ttd\u0026#34;)) { result.Valid = true; } else { result.Valid = false; result.Message = \u0026#34;Only ttd is allowed to instantiate this application.\u0026#34;; } return result; } } I Program.cs må tjenesten registreres med\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;IInstantiationValidator, InstantiationValidatorExample2\u0026gt;() Example 3 - Instantiation only allowed between certain dates To limit instantiation to a certain time frame, in this example January 2021, you can take some inspration from the following example.\nnamespace Altinn.App.Logic; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Models.Validation; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; public class InstantiationValidatorExample3 : IInstantiationValidator { public async Task\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult?\u0026gt; Validate(Instance instance) { DateTime now = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime(DateTime.UtcNow, TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(\u0026#34;Central European Standard Time\u0026#34;)); if (now \u0026lt; new DateTime(2021, 01, 01)) { return new InstantiationValidationResult { Valid = false, Message = \u0026#34;Application cannot be instantiated before 1.1.2021\u0026#34; }; } else if (now \u0026gt; new DateTime(2021, 01, 31)) { return new InstantiationValidationResult { Valid = false, Message = \u0026#34;Application cannot be instantiated after 25.1.2021\u0026#34; }; } return null; } } Logic connected to date handling has been added to ensure the Norwegian time zone is being used in the validation.\nDateTime now = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime(DateTime.UtcNow, TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(\u0026#34;Central European Standard Time\u0026#34;)); Furthermore, a simple test is run to see if the current time is within the given time frame\n(now \u0026lt; new DateTime(2021, 01, 01) If the requirements are not met, the return object is populated with an InstantiationValidationResult object that contains two fields: Valid: a boolean that says if the instantiation is valid or not.

	"description": "FAQ for the new stricter JsonSchema that arrived in 2023",
	"content": "What? During the start of September 2023 we upgraded the layout JsonSchema used by Altinn 3 apps to verify the layout files. This change made the JsonSchema stricter and might have caused your app to display an increased amount of validation errors (usually yellow lines) when developing locally in Visual Studio Code (or similar IDEs).\nThis document describes how to fix the most common errors in your app.\nWhy? When adding new properties and abilities to Altinn 3 apps, we used to update the JsonSchema file manually. Over time this has led to a JsonSchema that differed a bit from the internal workings of the app frontend. With this change we will make the JsonSchema stricter and derive the schema from a common configuration that we also use for our internal types in the app frontend. The philosophy behind the change is also to make the JsonSchema stricter, because a strict schema will make it easier to find errors in the layout files - and hopefully cause less confusion and frustration for app developers in the future.\nCommon errors and how to fix them Error showing up in the component id property Earlier changes to the JsonSchema has made the format of the id property stricter. You should make sure to avoid naming the id as something-{number}, as a trailing {dash}{number} is used internally in the app frontend to differentiate multiple instances of components in repeating groups. Naming your component this way may cause unexpected behavior in the app frontend.\nPS: Also make sure the component IDs are unique across the layout page, and all other layout pages in the same process step. The JsonSchema cannot verify this for you, but re-using component IDs will cause all components using the same ID to be hidden when only one of them is hidden.\nA Group component shows up with strange validation errors The Group component has been split into 4 different sub-types, as each of these have grown more complex over time. Your component needs to match one of these sub-types, and your JsonSchema validator may be confused about which one you\u0026rsquo;re trying to match if some properties are present that doesn\u0026rsquo;t match the sub-type you\u0026rsquo;re trying to use.\nGroups can now be one of:\nRepeating groups (with maxCount set to a number greater than 1) Repeating groups used to list Likert components (with maxCount set to a number greater than 1, and edit.mode set to likert) Non-repeating groups (with maxCount set to 1, 0 or undefined) Non-repeating groups with a panel property The most common problem here occurs if dataModelBindings or triggers is set on a non-repeating group sub-type. Non-repeating groups doesn\u0026rsquo;t support data model bindings or triggers, so you should remove these properties if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to use a non-repeating group. For both types of repeating groups, dataModelBindings are required, and you have to point to an array structure in the data model using the group property inside dataModelBindings. Without a data model binding, the repeating group will not be able to store any data, and its relation to components inside may fall apart.\nA FileUpload or FileUploadWithTag component warns about missing required property in dataModelBindings A FileUpload or FileUploadWithTag may have a dataModelBindings property, and it is required when setting it up inside a repeating group. The dataModelBindings may however be safely omitted entirely if the component is not placed inside a repeating group.\nA component warns about an unsupported property in textResourceBindings The textResourceBindings property now only supports a certain set of properties, and text resource bindings that are not implemented/handles anywhere in the app frontend will cause a validation error. The supported properties for each component type should now be listed in suggestions by Visual Studio Code.\nA component warns about dataModelBindings Binding a component to the data model only makes sense for form components that can store data. The entire property can be safely removed for components that doesn\u0026rsquo;t store data, such as Header, Paragraph, Button, etc.\nA component warns about the readOnly/required property The readOnly and required properties are only supported by form components. These properties can be safely removed for components such as Header, Paragraph, Button, etc, as they will have no effect on the component rendering.\nA Header component warns about missing size property Many configurations of the Header component seem to be missing the size property. This property is required.\nA component other than Header warns about the size property Many configurations also seem to have the size property set on components other than the Header component. This is most likely caused by copy-pasting the Header component, and forgetting to remove the size property. The size property is only supported by the Header component, and has no effect on other components (usually Paragraph or Panel).\nThe componentType property is not allowed Some examples in docs used this property, but it has been unused for quite some time in our code. It can be safely removed from your layout file.\nSetting optionsId to null produces a warning For components using options (such as Checkboxes, RadioButtons, Dropdown, etc) you should set either options, optionsId or source. Setting more than one of these, or setting one of them to null can lead to unexpected behavior in the app frontend or app backend. Removing the option that is set to null should resolve any issues.\n"

	"content": "Bruk av Redux Store i Containere og Components. Kort oppsummert (TL;DR) Send \u0026ldquo;ID\u0026rdquo; eller andre identifikatorer via Props til komponenten og la komponenten hente data fra Redux Store.\nUtfordring (Why?) Hvis en del av Redux Store sendes som Props så vil komponenten re-rendres ved endringer av denne Prop/Store. Det er ønskelig at komponenter ikke rendrer unødvendig.\nRe-rendring trigges av… Endring av Props. Endring av State som endrer Props. Kilder Redux best practices Common pitfalls Filtrering av Redux Store i mapStateToProps() ved help av Selector Kort oppsummert (TL;DR) Bruk Memoized Selector for å filtrere Redux Store til Props når Redux Store er stor.\nUtfordring (Why?) Hver gang (en del av) Redux Store endrer seg vil funksjoner som filtrerer ut deler av Redux Store kjøres. Hvis Redux Store (state tree) er stor (mange endringer) eller funksjonen er krevende kan det føre til ytelsesproblemer.\nLøsningen En Selector funksjon, med bruk av \u0026ldquo;reduxjs/reselect\u0026rdquo; vil kun kjøres når en definert del av Redux Store endres (eks \u0026ldquo;state.del.underdel\u0026rdquo;).\nKilder Reselect Comparing shouldComponentUpdate() and Reselect Eksempel Selector Dette er en enkel Selector uten mye logikk og filtrering. Jo større logikk i \u0026ldquo;filtreringen\u0026rdquo; jo mer \u0026ldquo;sparer\u0026rdquo; man i ytelse.\nimport { createSelector } from \u0026#39;reselect\u0026#39;; /** * Reselect version */ const formDataSelector = (state: any, providedProps: any) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;formdata selector\u0026#39;, providedProps.id); return state.formFiller.formData; }; const dataModelBindingSelector = (state: any, providedProps: any) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;datamodelBindingSelector\u0026#39;); return state.formDesigner.layout.components[providedProps.id].dataModelBinding; }; const getFormData = () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;getFormData() is trigggered, selector is created\u0026#39;); return createSelector( [formDataSelector, dataModelBindingSelector], (formData: any, dataModelBinding: any) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;ouput selector running\u0026#39;, formData); if (!formData) return \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; if (!formData[dataModelBinding]) return \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; return formData[dataModelBinding]; }, ); }; export const makeGetFormDataSelector = getFormData; // Alternativt en enda enklere variant, som er implementert p.t. import { createSelector } from \u0026#39;reselect\u0026#39;; const formDataSelector = (state: any, providedProps: any) =\u0026gt; { return state.formFiller.formData[state.formDesigner.layout.components[providedProps.id].dataModelBinding]; }; const getFormData = () =\u0026gt; { return createSelector( [formDataSelector], (formData: any) =\u0026gt; { if (!formData) return \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; return formData; }, ); }; export const makeGetFormDataSelector = getFormData; Implementasjon i mapStateToProps const makeMapStateToProps = () =\u0026gt; { const GetFormDataSelector = makeGetFormDataSelector(); const mapStateToProps = (state: IAppState, props: IProvidedProps): IFormElementProps =\u0026gt; ({ id: props.id, formData: GetFormDataSelector(state, props), }); return mapStateToProps; }; export const FormComponentWrapper = connect(makeMapStateToProps)(FormComponent); makeMapStateToProps implementeres slik at Selectoren kan gjenbrukes på tvers av flere komponenter.\nHigher-Order Components Higher-Order component er en funksjon som tar imot en component og returnerer et nytt komponent med ekstra funksjoner, eller ekstra data. Et eksempel på dette er connect-funksjonen fra \u0026ldquo;redux\u0026rdquo;, som tar imot en funksjon som velger redux-state data, og en komponent som disse dataene skal sendes til.\nHvorfor? Ved å wrappe induviduelle komponenter i en higher-order component, vil vi få enklere kode mtp. at en funksjon håndterer endringer i skjemaet på kun en komponent, i motsetning til å ha en funksjon som håndterer alle endringer i skjemaet. Dette vil også gi tredjeparts-utviklere en enklere måte å skrive egne funksjoner for håndtering av endringer i deres komponenter.\nEksempel på bruk i Altinn Studio Når bruker lager en tjeneste med 3. parts komponenter vil vi wrappe disse komponentene i en Higher Order Component som gir den en callback funksjon som tar imot data som komponenten har, og kjøre en redux-action som oppdaterer data i redux-state. Uten at utvikleren av 3. parts komponenten må sette seg inn i hvilke actions som skal kjøres. Dette gir også bedre mulighet for å gjennbruke 3. parts komponenter.\nEksempel på Higher Order Component const FormComponentWrapper = (WrappedComponent, ...) =\u0026gt; { // Feel free to do anything that will enhance the components properties // Return a react component return class extends React.Component { // Add functions for handling changing of data handleDataChange = (dataModelBinding, data) =\u0026gt; { // fire off an action for adding the changed data to redux state } render() { return( \u0026lt;WrappedComponent onFormDataChange={this.handleDataChange} {...props}/\u0026gt; ); } } } Kilder Higher-Order component Normalized Redux Store Kort oppsummert (TL;DR) Hver datatype får sin egen \u0026ldquo;tabell\u0026rdquo; i State. Hver \u0026ldquo;tabell\u0026rdquo; skal lagre individuelle \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; som objekter, med IDer som nøkler og \u0026ldquo;dataen\u0026rdquo; som verdi. Referansene til de individuelle \u0026ldquo;dataene\u0026rdquo; lagres ved å lagre IDene. Array med IDene brukes for å indikere sortering. Utfordring (Why?) Kompliserte reducers for å oppdatere nøstet state struktur. Unødvendig re-rendering grunnet oppdatering av nøstede objekter.

	"content": "To use the Altinn API, several scenarios require a Maskinporten client:\nCalling the Altinn API as an organization Authenticating as an enterprise user Authenticating as a system user Setting up the Maskinporten Client Maskinporten clients are created in the self-service portal:\nFor the production environment, clients are created from: https://sjolvbetjening.samarbeid.digdir.no. For the test environment, clients are created from: https://sjolvbetjening.test.samarbeid.digdir.no. Start by logging into your account with your chosen method. When logged into your account, the organisation you represent is shown in the top menu to the right. The organisation you represent is shown in the top menu. If you logged in to represent a synthetic organisation, you will also be able to change the synthetic organisation you represent in the drop down menu on that item. You can change the synthetic organisation you represent in the drop down menu. Select the Create client button to start creating a new client for the organisation you represent. On the Add client page select Maskinporten. On the Add Maskinporten client page fill in the display name, description and add your required scopes (these values can also be changed later). Then click the Create button. The \u0026#39;Add Maskinporten client\u0026#39; page. You have now created a Maskinporten client for your organisation. To use this client you need to add at least one authentication key. The client supports JWK and PEM keys. Start by either locating an existing key or creating a new one. You can use the Altinn JWKS tool or other key generator of your choice for this. Next, navigate to the key section on your client page and select Add. Keys can be added in the key section. In the JWK or PEM format field paste your public key and click Save. The key is now added to the client. Store your private key from your JWK or PEM in a secure location, as it is used to authorize the use of this client. If you use Azure Key Vault to store your private keys, they need to be base64-encoded before uploading. The JWK or PEM public key is pasted in this field If you didn\u0026rsquo;t do so in step 5, you need to add the desired scopes to your client before it can be used. From the Scopes tab on your client definition, click the Add button. Scopes available to your organisation will be shown in the list. Select the required ones and click Submit. Scope list Depending on your usage, you will need to add the relevant scopes to your client. In the table below you will find a collection of commonly used scopes:\nScope Usage Description altinn:instances.read Altinn Apps API read altinn:instances.write Altinn Apps API write altinn:authentication/systemregister Access to system register For system providers that need to manage systems available in system register altinn:authorization/authorize Access to PDP endpoint For orgs that need to authorize access For a list of legacy scopes, please refer to the Altinn 2 docs.\nAuthentication A detailed description on how to authenticate your client with a JWT Grant is described here.\nIn the context of an Altinn Studio app, integration with Maskinporten is available using the built-in authentication client. Simply follow along with the user guide to get started.\nFor other .Net apps, you can use this standalone library to handle authentication. The library provides extension methods to configure HttpClients to authenticate with Maskinporten based on your provided configuration.\n"

	"content": "Setting up the Maskinporten Client Maskinporten clients are created in the self-service portal:\nFor the production environment, clients are created from: https://sjolvbetjening.samarbeid.digdir.no. For the test environment, clients are created from: https://sjolvbetjening.test.samarbeid.digdir.no. Start by logging into your account with your chosen method. When logged into your account, the organisation you represent is shown in the top menu to the right. The organisation you represent is shown in the top menu. If you logged in to represent a synthetic organisation, you will also be able to change the synthetic organisation you represent in the drop down menu on that item. You can change the synthetic organisation you represent in the drop down menu. Select the Create client button to start creating a new client for the organisation you represent. On the Add client page select Maskinporten. On the Add Maskinporten client page fill in the display name, description and add your required scopes (these values can also be changed later). Then click the Create button. The \u0026#39;Add Maskinporten client\u0026#39; page. You have now created a Maskinporten client for your organisation. To use this client you need to add at least one authentication key. The client supports JWK and PEM keys. Start by either locating an existing key or creating a new one. You can use the Altinn JWKS tool or other key generator of your choice for this. Next, navigate to the key section on your client page and select Add. Keys can be added in the key section. In the JWK or PEM format field paste your public key and click Save. The key is now added to the client. Store your private key from your JWK or PEM in a secure location, as it is used to authorize the use of this client. If you use Azure Key Vault to store your private keys, they need to be base64-encoded before uploading. The JWK or PEM public key is pasted in this field If you didn\u0026rsquo;t do so in step 5, you need to add the desired scopes to your client before it can be used. From the Scopes tab on your client definition, click the Add button. Scopes available to your organisation will be shown in the list. Select the required ones and click Submit. Required scopes The client you just created requires the following scopes:\naltinn:serviceowner altinn:serviceowner/instances.read altinn:serviceowner/instances.write Using the Maskinporten client in the CLI In order to make use of your Maskinporten client, you need to add the JWK key pair from step 6 to the Altinn CLI configuration:\nLocate your Maskinporten configuration in the appsettings.json file and add a base64 representation of your key in the EncodedJwk field.\nIf you used the Altinn JWKS tool to generate your keys, you can make use of the export function with the --base64 flag to achieve this. Otherwise you can use any other base64 encoder tool, such as https://www.base64encode.org/.\n"

This enables greater flexibility for Messages in Altinn 3 and allows them to be used as either the only task in a process, or as a part of a larger process.\nWe have made some tools to simplify the process of getting started with setting up a message in an app.\nData model We have made a standard data model for messages, to make getting started easier.

Displaying of groups over multiple pages inside the editing area of the group is only supported for groups at the top level, and is not supported for nested groups. When entering data in a group, there may be incidents where each element in the group contains multiple fields, which may result in a lot of scrolling and confusion for the user. To solve this, there has been implemented a possibility to split the fill out over multiple pages, which the user can navigate through while filling out the group element. The navigation takes place within a layout, and updates only the display within the editing area of the group.\nTo make use of this functionality, you will have to prefix the components in the children list with a number indicating which \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; of the fill out the component should be displayed on, followed by :. We start the count on 0, that is to say components to be displayed on the first \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; must be prefixed with 0:. Components to be displayed on the second page must be prefixed with 1:, and so on. In addition, you must set \u0026quot;multiPage\u0026quot;: true in the edit-parameter.

Antatt høringsfrist blir slutten av okotber 2023. Etablere endelig versjon av tilgangspakker Pågående og planlagte aktiviteter\nTjenesteeiere kan begynne å sette tilgangspakker på apper og ressurser. Q4-24 Fullstendig GUI og komplett liste over tilgangspakker vil bli tilgjengelig i Ressursregisteret/Altinn Studio i løpet av Q4-24. Tjenesteeiere som har behov for å knytte tilgangspakke til tjeneste før, kan be om å få aktuell(e) tilgangspakke(r) tilgjengelig manuelt. Lansere ny brukerflate for fullmaktstyring for virksomheter (Q1 2025)\nPå ny brukerflate for tilgangsstyring, vil det være mulig å delegere roller, tilgangspakker og enkeltrettigheter, samt få oversikt over mottatte og gitte fullmakter. Det skal også være mulig å trekke tilbake gitte fullmakter og slette fullmakter man har fått. Avvikle Altinn 2 roller i løsningen (Q2 2026) Altinn 2-rollene fases ut samtidig som hele Altinn 2 slås av i juni 2026. Policyen for tjenesten vil på dette tidpunktet endres til å henvise til bare nye Altinn 3 tilgangspakker Fra dette tidspunktet mister ansatte tilgang til tjenester gjennom de gamle Altinn 2 rollene Det er ikke før vi lanserer ny brukeflate for de som er administratorer for virksomhetene at de nye tilgangspakkene faktisk blir tatt i bruk og det vil være mulig å gi disse til ansatte.\nVi har laget denne overordnede issuenfor innføring av nye tilgangspakker hvor tidsplan holdes oppdatert.\nSpørsmål og svar: Av dagens Altinn-roller, er det kun rollene \u0026ldquo;Utfyller/innsender\u0026rdquo; og \u0026ldquo;Begrenset signeringsrett\u0026rdquo; som ønskes fjernet? Nei, alle gamle Altinn2 roller vil fjernes, men noen får tilgangspakker som er ganske like, f.eks. rollen \u0026ldquo;patent og varemerke\u0026rdquo;\nVil gamle Altinn-roller inngå i ny modell? Etter en overgangsfase så vil alle eksisterende altinnroller fases ut og tjenester kun være tilgjengelig gjennom direkte delegering av tjeneste eller via en av de nye tilgangspakkene.\nVil koblingen mellom ER-roller og Altinn-roller bestå som i dag? Roller i Enhetsreisteret vil knyttes til de nye tilgangspakkene. Når man har avsluttet høring vil vi starte arbeidet med å bestemme hvilke ER-roller som skal få hvilke tilgangspakker. I dette arbeidet vil vi inkludere en vurdring av Enhetsregister-rollens lovmessige fullmakt til å opptre på vegne av virksomheten.\nPlanlegges det ingen endring på Altinn-rollene for privatpersoner, kun virksomheter? Jo, dette vil gjøres i fase to. Da innføres nye tilgangspakkene for innbyggere som erstatter dagens Altinn 2-roller. Intensjonen er at disse tilgangspakkene skal bygge på den granulering av fullmakter som er gjort for vergemål.\nVil tilgangspakkene være tjenesteeierspesifikke? Ingen av tilgangspakkene er i utgangspunktet \u0026ldquo;tjenesterierspesifikke\u0026rdquo; - men noen av de vil kanskje være i bruk av kun én eller et fåtall tjenesteeiere.\nVi har veldig mange tjenester i Altinn. Er tidsplan for å innføre nye tilgangspakker innen Altinn-rollene forsvinner realistisk?\nJa, det mener vi. Vi ser for oss at alle tjenesteeiere selv angir hvilke nye tilgangspakker som skal knyttes til nye/migrerte tjenester etterhvert som de flyttes. Tiden til å sette tilgangspakker på tjenester som allerede er etablert på Altinn 3 bør være tilstrekkelig gitt antallet tjenester som er etablert. Vi vil lage veiledning for dette slik at det skal være enkelt for dere å velge riktig tilgangspakke(r) og knytte det til tjenestene.\nÅ utvide policy for tjeneste med å legge til en ny tilgangspakke vil ikke påvirke tjenestens funksjonalitet, så det vil svært sannsynlig ikke være behov for testing utover den verifiseringen som gjøres av Altinn.\nNår tenker dere å slette dagens Altinn-roller og når vil de nye rollene være klare til å tas i bruk?\nSe tidsplan over.\nHva må vi i praksis gjøre med de appene vi har kjørende på Altinn 3 før/når endringen iverksettes?\nAppene må oppdateres med nye policyer som inkluderer nye tilgangspakker i tillegg til de rollene som er definert der i dag. Rollene som står på tjenesten kan stå der til Altinn 2 fases ut, så lenge tjenesten har fått ny(e) tilgangspakker i tillegg.\nVil enkeltrettighet forsvinne?\nNei, at en tjeneste endrer policy har ingen betydning for enkeltrettigehter som er delegert direkte på tjenesten. Alle enkeltrettigheter som en virksomhet har gitt til en ansatt i Altinn 2 vil flyttes sammen med lenketjenesten til Altinn 3 plattformen.\nMange av våre skjemaer dekker flere ulike tema og går ut til mange ulike næringer? Hvordan tenker dere at vi best håndterer slike?\nDet vil være mulig å knytte tjenester til flere ulike tilgangspakker samtidig. I tilfeller hvor tjenester omfatter flere tema bør man knytte tjenesten til alle fullmaktsområdene som passer.\nNår ny tjeneste for tilgangspakker er fullstendig satt i produksjon i Q2 2025, vil det da ikke være mulig lenger å delegere rettigheter på eksisterende måte?\nOgså etter at nye tilgangspakker er satt i produksjon så vil det fortsatt være mulig å deleger rettigheter til bare tjenesten/enkeltrettighet, på samme måte som i dag. Vi vurderer om de gamle Altinn 2-rollene fortsatt vil være mulig å gi videre til andre, men man vil i alle fall i en overgangsperiode fortsatt vil få utført tjenesten med denne rollen.\n"

	"tags": [],
	"description": "Altinn is open source with open backlogs and open documentation.",
	"content": "There are many who have noticed that Altinn has chosen a new and very open direction in the last 10 years.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve received questions about why, and thought it would be interesting that we share our thoughts on open source, as as central Norwegian national common component and a Digital Public Good.\nSharing and reuse There are many good reasons to share your code as open source.\nNAV, one of the trailblazers of open source in Norway, is also repeating several of the same arguments (Norwegian Only), and especially the importance of transparency and trust related to solutions financed by the public.\nWe applaud, when NAV writes this:\nSolutions funded by the public should be publicly available.\nThe motivation is then not mainly reuse, although it is obviously a nice side effect.\nThe motivation is primarily openness and transparency in the digital solutions.\nBut to be clear, reuse is something we in Altinn consider a central motivation. And we\u0026rsquo;re not alone thinking like this:\nthe UK government action plan Open Source, Open Standards and Re­Use (PDF) describes reuse as both a policy and a principle. EU has has had a clear open source strategy (PDF) for a long time. EU Governing Principle 5.3 - Share and then we have Switzerland, showing everybody how it should be done! We facilitate reuse and sharing at all levels of the Altinn architecture, from our principles to the entire platform and infrastructure, down to design and UI-widgets, code and configuration.\nThis is also one of several reasons why Altinn is now a Digital Public Good (DPG), where the goal is to be able to reuse everything we develop not only at national level, but also globally to accelerate the attainment of the sustainable development goals.\nWe also encourage the developers building apps using Altinn Studio to also share their apps. In fact, you have to do an active decision not to share, since sharing and reuse is central to the concept of Altinn.\nCooperation The best way to get a good collaboration across organizations and projects is openness and transparency, that everyone can contribute, provide input, be heard, follow what\u0026rsquo;s happening.\nThis has been a central point in the open source \u0026ldquo;revolution\u0026rdquo;, that has become the new norm for large parts of software development in the world. There are now 100 million developers and over 28 million public repositories on GitHub.\nSince all the tools and dependencies we use are open source on Github, we in Altinn can also follow what\u0026rsquo;s happening, and collaborate and contribute back to the software we\u0026rsquo;re using.\nExamples of such open source software is .NET, Kubernetes, React, Linkerd and Gitea. And our issue #5992 is a good example of how we can track and easily link to issues across software.\nAnd since Altinn is open source at Github, it is as easy for everyone else to do the same thing to us. Both creating new issues, contribute in discussions or contribute code, something the label community-contribution-❤️ illustrates well.\nVendor bindings Altinn as a national common component has previously experienced major challenges by building on closed proprietary software. Software from Adobe in Altinn 1 and from Microsoft in Altinn 2.\nEnd-of-life for proprietary software is actually the main reason for why we had to create Altinn 3.\nWhen building a solution on top of proprietary software, then you\u0026rsquo;ve lost control over your own future, for example if the vendor chooses to phase out the product.\nIf your solution is built on top of open source products then you, or anybody else, can make a fork in such a situation.\nAltinn 3 is therefore based on software and libraries which is open source.\nWe think this naturally is also very important for those who consider whether to adopt Altinn or not.\nWhich bindings do we introduce to Altinn as a technical solution and to Digdir as a \u0026ldquo;supplier\u0026rdquo;? Even though Altinn is a cooperation, this will be an important question.\nAltinn 3 is therefore completely open source with a permissive license, and everything runs as regular containers.\nThe best tools To develop good software, it is important to have access to good tools.\nOne thing that many may not think about is that when you share what you develop as open source, many of the very best tools out there are available - for free.\n\u0026ldquo;Share, and thou will be shared with\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHere are some of the wonderful SaaS-tools that we use:\nGitHub - Source code, backlogs, boards, automation, CI/CD, CodeQL, etc. CodeRabbit - AI reviews of your pull requsts Cypress - Dashboards and automated UI-testing. SonarCloud - Static analysis of source code. And this is just a small selection\u0026hellip;\nAlso, all tools and framework that we build Altinn 3 on top of, is open software that is also very popular.\nThe best people It is a common theme that people like to work with new technology and the best tools. The best developers also prefer to work with open source, feeling that one contributes to something bigger, that one leaves a mark on the world.\nIn the time that has passed since we launched Altinn 3 (Norwegian only) in the summer of 2020, we\u0026rsquo;ve hired some very skilled people, and a repeating pattern in interviews and discussions is that the best candidates are clearly expressing that they think open source is important, and that this is something they want to participate in.\nWe want to build a big community, where everyone can contribute, and then it is important that we have skilled and happy developers who can help make that happen.\n"

	"content": "Altinn 3 apps use Altinn\u0026rsquo;s NuGet packages and therefore offer a standard API that is consistent across apps. In an app, you can create an instance that goes through a process with various steps where you can work with data elements belonging to a data type. The data types are unique per app, and to be able to create an API client for an app, it is often necessary to refer to schemas for data models and content types for attachment types. To meet this need, after version 8.6.0 of the NuGet packages, we have two different OpenAPI specifications. One is a traditional auto-generated specification that contains all APIs but no information about different data types, and the other is an app-specific specification. Below you can see what the general specification looks like, but to see the app-specific specification, you must visit {org}.apps.altinn.no/{org}/{app}/swagger in a browser.\n"

	"content": "See below for details of how we have constructed the PEPs and how to configure them.\nStandard PEPs Developers should configure security when possible, which is one important principle we follow. Therefore, we have developed some standard policy enforcement points that API developers can use on different API endpoints.\nThe best way to solve Attribute-based authorization is by using Policy-Based Authorization in ASP.NET Core.\nWe have created the standard PEPs in the ASP.Net Web application as Authorization Handlers.\nThis is published on Nuget as Altinn.Common.PEP\nPolicy Enforcement - AppAccess The AppAccessHandler is the PEP for API endpoints that handle data related to an app created in Altinn Studio. This handler uses configuration on the API endpoint and API parameters to call the PDP to authorize access.\nSee AppAccessHandler and AppAccessRequirement for implementation details.\nIn the App, the API developer defines a set of AppAccessRequirement, and for each operation, the developer maps the correct requirement.\nExamples of requirements are:\nInstanceRead (User/system needs to be authorized to perform read action on the instance in its current state) InstanceWrite (User/system needs to be authorized to perform write action on the instance and its data in its current state) InstanceInstantiate (user/system needs to be authorized to Instantiate an instance for an app) The PEP will create a decision request (example) and call the PDP based on route data (like instanceId) and the authenticated Identity.\nBased on the response (example), the PEP will deny or approve the user. (Deny = http 403)\nThe PEP validates any obligation from the PDP like minimum authentication level. If this is not valid, the request will be denied (HTTP 403).\nConfiguration The application needs to have a startup configuration to enable the different standard PEPs.\nservices.AddAuthorization(options =\u0026gt; { options.AddPolicy(AuthzConstants.POLICY_INSTANCE_READ, policy =\u0026gt; policy.Requirements.Add(new AppAccessRequirement(\u0026#34;read\u0026#34;))); options.AddPolicy(AuthzConstants.POLICY_INSTANCE_WRITE, policy =\u0026gt; policy.Requirements.Add(new AppAccessRequirement(\u0026#34;write\u0026#34;))); options.AddPolicy(AuthzConstants.POLICY_INSTANCE_DELETE, policy =\u0026gt; policy.Requirements.Add(new AppAccessRequirement(\u0026#34;delete\u0026#34;))); options.AddPolicy(AuthzConstants.POLICY_INSTANCE_COMPLETE, policy =\u0026gt; policy.Requirements.Add(new AppAccessRequirement(\u0026#34;complete\u0026#34;))); }); Example from Storage Program.cs\nThe API needs to have enabled PEP for a given API operation.\n[Authorize(Policy = AuthzConstants.POLICY_INSTANCE_WRITE)] [HttpDelete(\u0026#34;data/{dataGuid:guid}\u0026#34;)] public async Task\u0026lt;ActionResult\u0026lt;DataElement\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Delete(int instanceOwnerPartyId, Guid instanceGuid, Guid dataGuid) Example from DataController\nPolicy Enforcement ScopeAccessHandler For scenarios where we require specific scopes to be authorized to call an API, we use the ScopeAccessHandler.\nIt supports multiple scopes.\nSee ScopeAccessHandler and ScopeAccessRequirement for implementation details.\nConfiguration The application needs to have a startup configuration to enable the different standard PEPs\nservices.AddAuthorization(options =\u0026gt; { options.AddPolicy(AuthorizationConstants.POLICY_SCOPE_EVENTS_PUBLISH, policy =\u0026gt; policy.Requirements.Add(new ScopeAccessRequirement(\u0026#34;altinn:events.publish\u0026#34;))); }); services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IAuthorizationHandler, ScopeAccessHandler\u0026gt;(); Example from program.cs in Events Component\nThe API needs to have enabled PEP for a given API operation\n[Authorize(Policy = AuthorizationConstants.POLICY_SCOPE_EVENTS_PUBLISH)] [Consumes(\u0026#34;application/cloudevents+json\u0026#34;)] [HttpPost] public async Task\u0026lt;ActionResult\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;\u0026gt; Post([FromBody] CloudEvent cloudEvent) Example from EventsController in Event Component\nPolicy enforcement ResourceAccess In Scenarios where we want to authorize API access based on the authorization policy for a given resource in Altinn Resource Registry, we use the ResourceAccessHandler.\nSee ResourceAccessHandler and ResourceAccessRequirement for implementation details.\nTODO Example use\nPolicy enforcement - ClaimsAccess For scenarios where we require a specific claim for the authenticated system/user, we use the ClaimsAccessHandler.\nConfiguration The application needs to have a startup configuration to enable the different standard PEPs.\nservices.AddAuthorization(options =\u0026gt; { options.AddPolicy(AuthzConstants.POLICY_STUDIO_DESIGNER, policy =\u0026gt; policy.Requirements.Add(new ClaimAccessRequirement(\u0026#34;urn:altinn:app\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;studio.designer\u0026#34;))); }); Custom PEP For some scenarios, it is impossible to authorize the request based on API parameters.\nThese scenarios require a custom PEP as part of API logic.\nThe example below retrieves a list of elements from the database.\nBefore the API returns the list, each element must be checked for authorization and only returned if the user calling API is authorized.\n[Authorize] [HttpGet(\u0026#34;{instanceOwnerPartyId:int}/{instanceGuid:guid}\u0026#34;)] public async Task\u0026lt;ActionResult\u0026gt; GetMessageBoxInstance( int instanceOwnerPartyId, Guid instanceGuid, [FromQuery] string language) { string[] acceptedLanguages = { \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nn\u0026#34; }; string languageId = \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;; if (language != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; acceptedLanguages.Contains(language.ToLower())) { languageId = language; } string instanceId = $\u0026#34;{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid}\u0026#34;; Instance instance = await _instanceRepository.GetOne(instanceId, instanceOwnerPartyId); if (instance == null) { return NotFound($\u0026#34;Could not find instance {instanceId}\u0026#34;); } List\u0026lt;MessageBoxInstance\u0026gt; authorizedInstanceList = await _authorizationHelper.AuthorizeMesseageBoxInstances( HttpContext.User, new List\u0026lt;Instance\u0026gt; { instance }); if (authorizedInstanceList.Count \u0026lt;= 0) { return Forbid(); } MessageBoxInstance authorizedInstance = authorizedInstanceList.First(); // get app texts and exchange all text keys.

	"content": "A application deployed to Altinn Apps will typical have a business process that users and systems need to follow.\nApps created in Altinn Studio uses BPMN 2.0 standard to describe the business process and the app will have functionality to support different types of tasks in the process.\nThe process is defined by the application developer in Altinn Studio. When a new app is created it a basic process is created.\nSupported Tasks Applications will support different processes with different types of task as part of the process. The current types of tasks is implemented and planned to be implemented. This list is not final.\nData This is the task where the user or system create and updates data for one more data models defined for the App.\nConfirmation (backlog) This is a task where user can look at the data filled and then confirm it.\nConfirmationAndSigning (backlog) This is a task where user can look at the data filled and then confirm and sign data.\nPayment (backlog) This is a task where user is redirected to a external payment provider to pay related to the process. The payment can be related to data filled out in earliers task, or can be a fixed value connected to the app.\nSee Github issue for details.\nSigning (backlog) Signing is a task where one or more users sign the data submitted. In most uses cases this is a strictly functional operation but depending on the authentication level it can be a digital signature involved. The different types of signing relevant for this platform is.\nThere is a epic for signing on GitHub.\nRegular signing Regular signing is when one user with a specific role is required to functional sign the data before submitting it.\nParalell signing This is a task where serverel users need/can sign the data in paralell. The task is completed when the needed amount of signatures has been added\nSee Github issue for details.\nUser controlled signing User controlled signing is a task where the data inputed in earliers task in process defines which users that needs to sign.\nSee GitHub issue for details.\nDigital Signing with BankId Digital signing with BankID creates a digital signature of the data for the instance.\nSee Github issue for details.\nLookup (backlog) This is a task in a process where user/system can lookup external data with help of inputs from UI or API.\nState change The application is responsible to make sure that.\nExample process There is some freedom of the order of task in the process, but not all combinations is functional valid.\nEach type of task will have som requirement to be fullfilled to be allowed to be completed.\nThe below diagram show some example processes that a App possible will support in the future. Even it is possible to technical order the different types of task.\nProcess: Data Process with data task This is the a common process. In this scenario a user will typical fill out formdata and when formfilling task is completed the data will be marked as locked and the final data can be read from the org.\nThe org will be able to read data before the formfilling task is completed, but then the end user can still update the data.\nProcess: Data - Signing Process with data and signing tasks This is the a common process. In this scenario a user will typical fill out formdata and when formfilling task is completed, the process is moved to a signing task where the user can verify the data and then confirm it with a signing of data.\nDepending on the required security level for the application the signing will use PKI systems to digital sign the data or just be a more functional confirmation from the user.\nThe org will be able to read data before the formfilling task is completed, but then the end user can still update the data. The data will not be allowed to be changed while the instance is in signing task.\nProcess: Data - Confirmation - Payment Process with data, confirmation and payment tasks In this scenario a user will typical fill out formdata and when formfilling task is completed, the process is moved to a confirm task where the user can verify the data and then confirm, when the data is confirmed the process is moved to a payment task where the user needs to pay before the process is completed.\nThe payment functionality will be handled by external payment providers. The app will integrate with API\u0026rsquo;s for the payment provider. Altinn runtime will support different payment providers.\nProcess: Data - Confirmation - External validation Process with data, confirmation and external validation tasks In this scenario a user or system will typical fill out formdata and when formfilling task is completed, the process is moved to a confirm task where the user can verify the data and then confirm it.\nThe process is the moved to a external validation task where the org is doing validation. The org can chose to complete the task or send the instance back to a earlier task for correction of the data.\n"

	"description": "This guide describes in detail how application owners/service owners can receive data reported to an Altinn 3 application.",
	"content": "Overall concept Altinn offers a platform for the development and operation of digital services. If the services require the end user (citizen/business) to report data, this data will initially be stored in Altinn. The service owner must retrieve this received data from Altinn\u0026rsquo;s data storage using API integration. This guide describes how such an integration can be set up.\nAbout process flow in applications An application developed in Altinn Studio can have different processes depending on the service owner\u0026rsquo;s needs. For a service that collects data, there will typically be at least one data step where the end user can enter data. Additionally, there may be a confirmation step where the end user can review the data before confirming that it is correct.\nFor such a service, the process in the app itself will be completed when the end user clicks confirm. This process can be part of a larger process orchestrated by the service owner.\nInstantiation of service Instantiation in Altinn means that a dialogue is created in a submitter/party\u0026rsquo;s inbox in Altinn. This instantiation can be triggered by the end user or by the service owner. In this guide, we assume that it is instantiated by the end user. A guide for service owner instantiation can be found here.\nOverall end user process The overall process:\nThe end user instantiates the service in the party\u0026rsquo;s message box in Altinn. This can be done via API or in a browser on Altinn.no. The form is filled out and any attachment data is uploaded. The end user validates the data and any attachments and sends the application process for confirmation. The end user reviews the data and confirms that they have completed the process. The application publishes an event that the end user has completed the filling process. (Assumes that publishing is enabled) The service owner receives information about the event at their event receiver. The service owner calls the Altinn API to download data for the instance. The service owner confirms that the data has been downloaded successfully. Technical requirements Development of the application is covered in the Application Development Guide. Activation of event publishing from the application is described in the guide.\nRequirements for the webhook to receive events can be found here.\nThe service owner must have registered an integration in Maskinporten. Creation of the integration is described in the Guide here.\nDetailed technical process Service owner system receives Event from Altinn Events The first step in the process is that the receiving endpoint receives information about the Event from the Application running in Altinn.

Denne vil inneholde detaljert beskrivelse av feature samt referer til underoppgaver som f.eks\nFunksjonelle beskrivelser og tekniske analyser User Experience og Interaction design hensyn Juridiske vurderinger Sikkerhets vurderinger Kostnad/finansierings betraktninger (Oversikt over hvilke apper som har dette behovet?) Det er produkteierne som i utgangspunktet eier denne, men får hjelp av teamarkitekter, utviklere, jurister og andre som trengs for å spesifisere disse Denne featuren epic vil ligge i produktbackloggen hvor den mest naturlig hører hjemme. Det vil være naturlig at man itererer over denne mange ganger i product planing, før den er klar til product refinement.\nEksempel 1 - funksjonel signering\nAnsvarlig: Produkteiere Analyse issues Analyse issue er github issues som typisk er lenket til product epic. Dette vil være premissgiveres vurderinger til videre realisering av epicen.\nDette kan altså f.eks være\nUser Experience og Interaction design hensyn Juridiske vurderinger Sikkerhets vurderinger Kostnad/finansierings betraktninger Aktører\nAnsvarlig: Produkteiere Utførende: Diverse premissgivere Eksempel\nUX Analyse tabell Development issue Dette er detaljerte oppgaver som er knyttet til epic og kan være analyse oppgaver eller rene implementasjonsoppgave. Issue tilknyttet en produkt feature epic trenger ikke å ligge i samme backlog som epic. Disse tas inn i sprinter som del av sprint planning\nAnsvarlig: Devops team Utførende: Devops team Roadmap feature Denne beskriver overordnet hvilken funksjonalitet feature dekker og egenskapene ved funksjonaliteten. Formålet er at eksterne interessenter skal kunne lese denne uten å lese noe annet for å få en god forståelse hvilken funksjonalitet en slik feature dekker og når den kommer.\nDenne opprettes av produkteierene. Vanligvis basert på product epics, etter at den er nødvendig analysert og kan tas inn i roadmap. Roadmap features finnes i Roadmap repository. Vi ønsker å legge oss på detaljnivået til Github Roadmap for roadmap features\nAnsvarlig: Produkteier Utførene: Produkteier Prosess Følgende prosess følges med artifakten\nRoadmap process Fullscreen\nProduct planing Dette er arbeidet som produkteierne utfører, sammen med andre ressurser, for å skape og jobbe med epics i produkt backloggen og tilhørende analyse issues. En oppsummering av et slikt element vil kunne ende opp som et road map feature.\nAnsvarlig: Produkteier Støtte: Forretningsutviklere, Arkitekter, UX, Jurister, Sikkerhet, Forretning, Leverandørstyrere, samt andre produkteiere. Product refinement Dette er en behandling med utgangspunkt i produkt epics med hensikt om å definere underliggende development issues. Altså gjøre klart for sprintplaning, eventuelt sende det tilbake til produkt planing.\nMålet med feature refinement er å detaljere issue til et nivå at team kan ta oppgavene inn i sprinter.\nViktige teknologi valg må være analysert Bør være mulig å identifisere oppgaver å dele opp i egne issues Være detaljert nok til at man kan si noe om omfang. Sprint planing DevOps teamet tar inn development issues i en (eller flere) sprinter basert på kapasitet.\n"

These are identified with a national identity number (from the National Population Register) or an organization number (from the Register of Legal Entities).\nThere are two main types of roles to which an authorization rule can be linked: External roles and Altinn roles.\nExternal roles Information about external roles is retrieved from various public and authoritative registers.\nThe authorization these roles provide is regulated by laws and regulations that legitimize that a role holder should automatically be granted access to certain services or data on behalf of the actor.\nIt is the responsible authority, together with Altinn’s administration, that determines which authorizations it is natural for an external role to have in Altinn.\nExternal roles for an actor can only be changed by the responsible entity that owns the authoritative register.\nAltinn uses roles from the following authoritative registers:\nRoles from the Register of Legal Entities These roles are used when the actor is an organization.\nYou can read more about which roles from the Register of Legal Entities are used in Altinn here.\nRoles from the Norwegian Tax Administration These roles are used when the actor is an organization or an individual.\nYou can read more about which roles from the Tax Administration are used here.\nRoles from the Employer and Employee Register This is not implemented today but is on the backlog as a new source of external roles.\nRoles regarding Guardianship from the Norwegian Civil Affairs Authority This is not implemented today but is on the backlog as a new source of external roles.\nRoles regarding Parental Responsibility This is not implemented today but is on the backlog as a new source of external roles.\nRoles from the Register of Lawyers at the Supervisory Council for Legal Practice This is not implemented today but is on the backlog as a new source of external roles.\nAltinn roles These roles are used when the actor is an organization or an individual.\nAltinn roles can (unlike external roles) be administered and changed via Altinn Profile by the administrator for the actor.\nAPI for role information There is an API for retrieving information about all roles registered in Altinn 2.\nDocumentation of the API can be found here under the heading “Retrieve metadata about role definitions in Altinn.”\nThe API is open and available to everyone at the link https://www.altinn.no/api/metadata/roledefinitions.\nRoles from AltinnAltinn roles that can be used to grant access to an application.\nRoles from Enhetsregisteret\u0026lt;todo\u0026gt;\nRoles from Skatteetaten\u0026lt;todo\u0026gt;\n"

	"content": "The below diagram shows how the number of unique users logged in to Altinn 2 varied through 2019.\nUnique users 2019 per day Altinn 2 platform Altinn 2 is a monolith where all digital services run on the same servers. This means that days like the tax day when there is this enormous spike in traffic will require that all servers are scaled up. It is also an on-prem solution where scaling needs to be planned weeks ahead.\nFor Altinn 3 the story is completely different. Every organization has its separate Kubernetes cluster. Each of these clusters can be scaled independently.\nCluster Autoscaler Azure Kubernetes Services does support autoscaling of nodes and pods. Read more about cluster autoscaling.\nThis is currently not been enabled.\nResource Reservations in Azure Kubernetes Services Node resources are utilized by AKS to make the node function as part of your cluster. This usage creates a discrepancy between the node\u0026rsquo;s total resources and the resources allocatable when used in AKS. This information is important to note when setting requests and limits for user deployed pods.\nFor Altinn 3 this means the following\nStandard_D2s_v3: 100 millicores reserved per node, 1900 millicores to use Standard_D4s_v3: 140 millicores reserved per node, 3860 millicores to use Standard_D8s_v3: 180 millicores reserved per node, 7820 millicores to use Read more about resource reservations\nResource limitations In Kubernetes, it is possible to set resource limitations for each pod deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. In addition, we can define the number of minimum resources required for the pod.\n. Below there is a general example where the minimum CPU is set to 100milliCPU and maximum to 250milliCPU.\nkind: Pod apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: mypod spec: containers: - name: mypod image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine resources: requests: cpu: 100m memory: 128Mi limits: cpu: 250m memory: 256Mi Read about best practice for managing resources in Azure Kubernetes Services\nScaling org clusters There are currently more than 50 orgs hosting digital services in the Altinn 2 platform.\nThey range from Tax Department, Police, the Civil Aviation Authority, and many more. Some have digital services used by millions of citizens every year, while others have digital services used only by 1 person during a year. Some have many digital services while others just 1.\nThis means that the compute requirements for the different cluster vary a lot between the different orgs.\nTo exemplify this we shown the transaction statistics from three different orgs for 2019 in Altinn 2.\nAt the current time, we don\u0026rsquo;t know what kind of CPU usage an average transaction requires.\nIn this example, we assume that 1000 transactions require 1 CPU. (1000 milliCPU)\nThis is probably not correct.\nOrg 1 SKD is the largest org in Altinn 2. Daily transactions vary between 2500 and 365.000.\nThat would mean that SKD would need up to 192 nodes of Standard_D2s_v3\nNumber of daily transactions Org 2 BRG is one of the larger orgs in Altinn. Daily transactions vary between 300 and 14.000.\nThat would mean that BRG would need up to 8 nodes of Standard_D2s_v3\nNumber of daily transactions Org 3 HDIR is a medium org in Altinn. Daily transactions vary between 300 and 950.\nThat would mean that HDIR would never need more than 3 nodes of Standard_D2s_v3\nNumber of daily transactions We have not yet decided how we will be doing scaling of org clusters. We have identified some approaches.\nScaling option 1 The first option is manually scale both pods and nodes.\nThis means that the Altinn Devops team would manually need to increase or decrease the number of nodes based on obeserved/expected usage.\nThe number of pods for a specific application would also be manually set.\nCons Unknown of LoadBalancer is able to distribute traffic correctly Scaling option 2 "

	"content": "Person lookup The person lookup service can be use to verify a national identity number and to retrieve person information about the identified person. The user will need to provide the national identity number and the last name of the person. The service will then verify the input by comparing it with stored data. Both input are required and the last name is used to prevent cleaning of random identity numbers. If the user inputs invalid data too many times the service will block the user for some time.\nThe returned person data can be used to populate additional fields in the model.\nThe use of this service requires that end user is authenticated with a level 2 or higher authentication mechanism. Hence your application must also require minimum authentication level 2. v7 Person lookup example The service can be used in any of the handlers in the logic namespace. Below we\u0026rsquo;ve created an example using the ProcessDataWrite method in DataProcessor.\nusing System; using System.Threading; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Core.Features; using Altinn.App.Core.Interface; using Altinn.App.Models; using Altinn.Platform.Register.Models; using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.DataProcessing; public class DataProcessor : IDataProcessor public async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataWrite( Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { if (data is MessageV1 message) { Person person = await _personLookup.GetPerson( message.Personnummer, message.Etternavn, CancellationToken.None); message.Fornavn = person.FirstName; return true; } return false; } For this to work we\u0026rsquo;ll need to do a few other changes in DataProcessor.\nAdd a private field _personLookup for the lookup service and change the constructor to take an instance of the service. Initialize the field in the body of the constructor.\nprivate readonly IPersonLookup _personLookup; public DataProcessingHandler(IPersonLookup personLookup) { _personLookup = personLookup; } Register you custom implementation in the Program.cs class\nvoid RegisterCustomAppServices(IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration config) { services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IPersonService, PersonService\u0026gt;(); services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IDataProcessor, DataProcessor\u0026gt;(); // Other custom services } v4, v5, v6 Person lookup example The service can be used in any of the handlers in the logic namespace. Below we\u0026rsquo;ve created an example using the ProcessDataWrite method in DataProcessingHandler.\npublic async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataWrite( Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { if (data is MessageV1 message) { Person person = await _personLookup.GetPerson( message.Personnummer, message.Etternavn, CancellationToken.None); message.Fornavn = person.FirstName; return true; } return false; } For this to work we\u0026rsquo;ll need to do a few other changes in DataProcessingHandler.\nAdd a private field for the lookup service and change the constructor to take an instance of the service. Initialize the field in the body of the constructor.\nprivate readonly IPersonLookup _personLookup; public DataProcessingHandler(IPersonLookup personLookup) { _personLookup = personLookup; } The changes to the DataProcessingHandler constructor also force us to update the constructor call from the App class constructor. Add IPersonLookup as an input parameter and use the parameter value as input to the constructor of DataProcessingHandler.\npublic App( ... IText textService, IPersonLookup personLookup, IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor) : base(...) { _logger = logger; _validationHandler = new ValidationHandler(httpContextAccessor); _dataProcessingHandler = new DataProcessingHandler(personLookup); _instantiationHandler = new InstantiationHandler(profileService, registerService); _pdfHandler = new PdfHandler(); } A note on exception handling With no other changes than those above, the app backend will return response code 429 - TooManyRequests if the user has been typing in invalid data too many times. This response code is currently not handled by the frontend react application which results in an \u0026ldquo;unknown error\u0026rdquo;. This can be avoided with exception handling that singles out any PlatformHttpException with a response with status code 429, but there are currently no built in mechanism to convey to the user why a request failed. A workaround for this limitation is to use a property on the data model.\ntry { ... return true; } catch (PlatformHttpException phex) { switch (phex.Response.StatusCode) { case HttpStatusCode.TooManyRequests: // Add corrective messures break; case HttpStatusCode.NotFound: // Add corrective messures break; } throw; } "

	"content": "This functionality must be set up manually directly in form layout for now.\nNOTE: This functionality requires app-frontend v3 or newer. See this link for more information.\nMark a field as optional It is possible to mark a field as optional. The default is that required fields are marked as required (with *), while optional fields have no marking.\nDefault optional field (no marking). Default required field (marked with *). Default behaviour can be overwritten by changing the settings of the field. This is done in the labelSettings property of a component in the form layout.\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;labelSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;optionalIndicator\u0026#34;: true } } } By setting optionalIndicator to true, the text (Optional) will be shown after the field label.\nOptional field with marking. NOTE: It is not possible to force the Optional marking on a field that is required. Changing the optionalIndicator property does not alter or overrule the other properties of the field.\nEnable character limit You can now include the maxLength property in input fields to specify the maximum number of characters allowed. This will provide a countdown display indicating the number of remaining characters. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example implementation:\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;maxLength\u0026#34;: 10 } } Note: When using maxLength within the form layout, it will only indicate the number of remaining characters. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t validate the number of characters entered and user can still submit the form while it is exceeded the maxLength. To validate the number of characters entered, you must also include the maxLength property in the JSON schema data model of the form. See validation for more information.\nConfiguring automatic save while typing Input components, TextArea components and Address (AddressComponent in v3) automatically save changes while the user is typing. By default, this happens 400 milliseconds after the user last stopped typing. At this point validation and triggers will execute as well. In cases where validations and triggers are resource intensive, it might be necessary to increase the delay before saving automatically - or disable it altogether.\nThis functionality can be controlled using the saveWhileTyping property of a component in the form layout. In the example below, data is saved 2 seconds after the user stopped typing.\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-field1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;saveWhileTyping\u0026#34;: 2000 } } If this property is set to false, typing is the field does not trigger auto-saving or validation at all, and these processes will only run when the user changes focus out of the field.\n"

Setting up a signing task in the process file requires a bit more work than a regular data, confirm or feedback task.\nThis page will walk you through what you need to configure and how that is connected to other parts of the configuration.\nDefining and configuring a signing task A signing task in its simples format looks something like this:\n\u0026lt;bpmn:task id=\u0026#34;Task_2\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;Signing\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:incoming\u0026gt;Flow_1enq1lu\u0026lt;/bpmn:incoming\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt;Flow_0ybpfuh\u0026lt;/bpmn:outgoing\u0026gt; \u0026lt;bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:taskType\u0026gt;signing\u0026lt;/altinn:taskType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action\u0026gt;sign\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:signatureConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:dataTypesToSign\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:dataType\u0026gt;Model\u0026lt;/altinn:dataType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:dataTypesToSign\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:signatureDataType\u0026gt;signature\u0026lt;/altinn:signatureDataType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:signatureConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:taskExtension\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:extensionElements\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/bpmn:task\u0026gt; Making sign an available action As for confirmation steps we need to define the actions available, to generate a signing object the user needs to be able to perform the sign action:\n\u0026lt;altinn:actions\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:action\u0026gt;sign\u0026lt;/altinn:action\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:actions\u0026gt; The sign action can be the only option or in combination with other actions like confirm and/or reject, based on the needs of each application.\nConfigure what dataelements to sign Once a user performs a sign action the config from \u0026lt;altinn:signatureConfig\u0026gt; will be used to create a signature object.\nCurrently the app developer defines what data elements are going to be a part of the signature object by defining a list of dataTypes. This can be form data, attachments or pdfs.\nThe dataTypes are defined in the App/config/applicationmetadata.json file.\nThe example signing task above defines that alle dataelements connected to the dataType Model should be a part of the signature.\nIf the application also has a datatype with attachments named attachments where the user provides additional files that the developer wants to be a part of the signature object the \u0026lt;altinn:signatureConfig\u0026gt; should look like this:\n\u0026lt;altinn:signatureConfig\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:dataTypesToSign\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:dataType\u0026gt;Model\u0026lt;/altinn:dataType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:dataType\u0026gt;attachmetns\u0026lt;/altinn:dataType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:dataTypesToSign\u0026gt; \u0026lt;altinn:signatureDataType\u0026gt;signature\u0026lt;/altinn:signatureDataType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/altinn:signatureConfig\u0026gt; Configure where to store the signature object A signature object also requires a dataType where it should be stored once generated.

This is done through a separate layout set, which in turn is associated with the signing process step (Task_2 in our example).\nIf you have a v3 application without a layout set, see Pages for how to set this up.\nCreate a new folder in App/ui/ with a name that describes this layout set, for example, signing. In this folder, create the file Settings.json and a folder named layouts.\nIn the layouts folder, create files that define how pages in this layout set should look. The only component that a signing layout must have is an ActionButton with \u0026quot;action\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;sign\u0026quot;, which defines that when the user presses this, they perform the sign action, advancing the process.\nAn example of a simple layout with a read-only text field and a signing button may look like this:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;name-readonly-input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;

The signeeInfo object holds the information about who performed the signing.\nVerifying the SHA256 hash The hash value, also referred to as a digest, is the output from the SHA256 hashing method. In the example above, the digest has been produced from a file belonging to a specific data element. In other words: the fingerprint of the file the user has signed.\nTo verify the signature, an independent SHA256 hash of the same file should be produced and then compared to the stored value. If the two values are identical, the file remains unchanged and the signature is valid.\nAdditional information regarding Altinn\u0026rsquo;s implementation of the SHA256 hashing algorithm and digest can be found on Github. In essence, the digest is a SHA256 hash of the file in question, formatted as a lowercase hexadecimal string without delimiters.\n"

	"content": "The main goal for how the software is build is that adding new commands, subcommands and options shall be simple. This is solved by implementing a generic command interpreter that does not require changes when new commands,subcommands and options are added.\nThe generic implementation is based on software Interfaces. This requires that new software classes implements the appropriate interfaces so they can be found when matching command line values against commands, subcommands and options.\nThe second important implementation detail is that the commands with definitions is defined in a json file, CommandDefs.json. The file is part of the project as an embedded resource but can be modified and saved at the location defined in the Application setting parameters CommandDefinitionFile.\nThe CLI Application searches for the file at startup, the CommandDefinitionFile is search first.\nApplication settings Setting which is required for the CLI Application is defined in the appsettings.json file.

The specific address to be used is selected by dedicated ClinetWrapper which forwards it to the HttpClientWrapper which computes a complete URL. StorageInputFolder Defines folder for storing fetched files StorageOutputFolder Defines folder for where files to send shall be fetched CommandDefinitionFile Defines in which folder the command definition file CommandDefs.json is located. Kommando Definisjon The command definition file, CommandDefs.json defines all commands with subcommands and options which can be \u0026ldquo;executed\u0026rdquo; i the CLI application. The file is initially a resource is the development project. New commands can be added following this format:\n{ \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Login\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SubCommands\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Maskinporten\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Options\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;clientId\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Guid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;valuerange\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;client guid id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;apiname\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;clientid\u0026#34; }, ] } ] } First element Name: defines the command name, next Name defines the subcommand name. No other parameters can be defined on this level. Options is an array with following elements:\nElement name Description Name name of the option, the same must be used on the command line, not case sensitive type option datatype. See list below for valid types, type is case sensitive valuerange valid range description description of the parameter to be used in Help apiname name of the option in the API that is accessed, name is case sensitive Valid Data typers Option Type System Type Opsjons klasse bool System.Boolean NumberOption byte System.Byte NumberOption sbyte System.Decimal NumberOption double System.Double NumberOption float System.Single NumberOption int System.Int32 NumberOption uint System.UInt32 NumberOption long System.Int64 NumberOption ulong System.UInt64 NumberOption object System.Object NumberOption short System.Int16 NumberOption ushort System.UInt16 NumberOption string System.String NumberOption datetime System.DateTime NumberOption guid System.Guid NumberOption file System.IO.FileStream FileOption thumbprint System.String ThumbPrintOption Class Overview Implemented classes in base project Program Program is the startup \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; in the CLI Application. It’s main purpose it to implement CLI functionality and register classes that handles commands and subcommands. Register means in this context to scan the application for classes that implements interfaces that shall be searchable in the generic code.\nICommand Must be implemented by all command classes ISubCommandHandler Must be implemented by all subcommand classes IHelp Implemented on all classes that have info to be display by the help command\nThe actual CLI implementation consist in reading the keyboard and forward it to the ApplicationManager\nLogging Logger is injected to the registered command and is configured as a part of the service registration. Logging is default configured to output on console and file for all log levels.\nLog.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .MinimumLevel.Debug() .WriteTo.File(\u0026#34;log.txt\u0026#34;, LogEventLevel.Information) .WriteTo.Console(restrictedToMinimumLevel: LogEventLevel.Information) .CreateLogger(); ApplicationManager The ApplicationManager instantiates command and eventually subcommand from the two first console input parameters. The parameters are used as search criteria’s for finding relevant command/subcommand classes. If a match is found command line input option parameters will be matched and validated against selectable options.\nNot found or illegal value will terminate the command and a proper log message will be displayed in the consol.\nCommand A command class must implement the ICommand interface to be registered in Program. That makes the command available for the generic code which is selecting a command based on the command line input.\nThe selection is based on the implementation of the ICommand interface and the Name property which must match the command name on the command line. The command itself is executed by calling any of the the command class Run methods.\nThere exist two Run commands, one with the SubCommand as parameter and one with a list of command line input parameters that is called if no subcommand is specified.\npublic interface ICommand { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Run the supported command handler /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;commandHandler\u0026#34;\u0026gt;the command handler to execute\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; void Run(ISubCommandHandler commandHandler = null); /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Parses the dictionary and run command. Used mainly by Help /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;input\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Dictionary with the cli input paramters\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; void Run(Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; input); /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Gets the name of the service /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; string Name { get; } } SubCommand public interface ISubCommandHandler : IValidate { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;returns\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/returns\u0026gt; bool Run(); /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Name of the command handler /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; string Name { get; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Name of the command for which the command is implemented /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; string CommandProvider { get; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Dictionary with cli input options /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; Dictionary\u0026lt;string,string\u0026gt; DictOptions { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public List\u0026lt;IOption\u0026gt; SelectableCliOptions { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Dictionary with cli input options /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; List\u0026lt;IOption\u0026gt; CliOptions { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Dictionary with cli input options /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; IFileWrapper CliFileWrapper { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Builds the options that can control the command. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; void BuildSelectableCommands(); } Option An Option binds the definitions specified at the command line to a definition defined in the CommandDefinition file. The handling of the option is as described in the ApplicationManager description partly done by generic code. Partly means here creation of correct option type based on the option\u0026rsquo;s type definition property and the activation of validation.\nThe actual validation is implemented in the option class itself. An Option base class is implemented with basic functionality like the TryParse method that is used as a part of the validation of the NumberOption type.\n/// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Interface that defines the propertioes and methods that /// shall be implemented by an Option class /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public interface IOption : IValidate { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// The Name og the oprtion that must match the Name /// of the otion in the CommandDefinition file /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public string Name { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// The name of the opsjon in ther API. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public string ApiName { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// The value of the option as a string /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; string Value { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Defines if the option is defined with a vlue in /// the command line /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; bool IsAssigned { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// The description of the option that will be used by help /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; string Description { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Valid range for the paramtere. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; string Range { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Gets the typed value of the option as defined /// in the option definition /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;returns\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/returns\u0026gt; object GetValue(); } A set of Option classes is implemented to cover the most used system types. Mapping from the type set in the definition file to a C# class is shown in the table in the subchapter Valid Data Types. The main reasons for implementing dedicated classes is the possibility to implement generic handling of them together with the advantage of implementing separate code in them like validation.\nNumberOption - represent all simple System Data Types FileOption - represent a file, the value of the option shall contain full path to the file. The validation verifies that the file exists. ThumbPrintOption - This option is used as to represent the *thumbprint\u0026quot; value in the ceritificat that is used in Login.\nOptionBuilder Much of the handling of Options is done by the Singleton class OptionBuilder. Main reason for making it as a Singleton is to avoid reading the CommandDefs file for each command. The file is read initially and save in the class member CfgCommands.\nThere are two public methods in the OptionBuilder, BuildAvailableOptions andAssignValueToCliOptions.\nBuildAvailableOptions BuildAvailableOptions finds command/subcommand in the list of available commands defined in the CommandDefs.json and according to defined type instantiates classes with options of correct type.\nAssignValueToCliOptions AssignValueToCliOptions is responsible for validation and assignment of input options. Not valid options/option values are logged, and command is terminated.\nValidation NumberOption\nValidation is done by the generic method TryParse which is call in the Validate method.\nFileOption\nThe FileOption class overrides the Base class defined Validate method. The actual validation consist in a check for the existence of the specified file.\nThumbPrintOption\nThe ThumbPrintOption class overrides the Base class defined Validate method. The actual validation consist is a check for the existence of a certificate in the \u0026ldquo;LocalStore\u0026rdquo; with same thumbprint as the specified thumbprint.\nClientWrapper The construction of the URL is done in dedicated ClientWrapper classes. A dedicated wrapper shall be made for each command. An Interface that defines all public methods in the wrapper shall be made. The interface shall be implemented in a test wrapper that shall be used in unit testing.\nTest Wrapper The test wrapper shall be coded and configures to make verification of command execution possible without connecting to the actual API. The class will mainly be used in unit testing but can also be used to test with real data. That is best done by catching \u0026ldquo;responses\u0026rdquo;, saving the respons and use it in the test that can load the response file(s).\nHttpClientWrapper The HttpClientWrapper make the HHP(s) requests. The wrapper builds the URL based on input parameter. In addition header with required parameters and tokens is build and attached to the requests that is required for authorization on the server side.\nExtensions Command Adding a new command requires following addtions:\nCommand definition on the CommandDefs.json, must include subcommand and options. Command name must be unique. Folder in the development project named with the command name. C# class with name on the command. The class must implement ICommand and IHelp interface Interface which define the methods in the ClientWrapper that will be used by the SubCommandHandler. C# ClientWrapper and a ClientFileWrapper class which implements the ClientWrapper interface. Folder SubCommandHandlers as a subfolder to the new Command folder. C# class for the subcommand which inherits SubCommandHandlerBase and implements ISubCommandHandler and IHelp interface. SubKommando Extend command definition with new subcommand definition in CommandDefs.json, include Option definitions Eventually extend ClientWrapper interface with new method(s) which will be used by the new SubCommandHandler Eventually extend C# ClientWrapper and ClientFileWrapper with new methods defined in the interface C# class for the new subcommand which inherits SubCommandHandlerBase and implements ISubCommandHandler and IHelp interface. Option Extend subcommand with new option definition in CommandDefs.json Eventuelt utvide ClientWrapper Interface med ny(e) method(s) which will be used by the SubCommandoHandle for å få med nye opsjoner Eventually extend ClientWrapper interface with new methode(s) which will be used by the new SubCommandHandler Eventually extend C# ClientWrapper and ClientFileWrapper with new methods defined in the interface Add handling of the new options, if required, to the SubCommandHandler None of the extensions shall require changes in the HttpClientWrapp\u0026rsquo;s. New methods shall be added if changes is required to avoid breaking existing code\n"

	"content": "The two primary data structures This will be an overview of the primary models used by Storage (and apps from Altinn Studio). The primary purpose of this is to form a basic understanding of the models before introducing the APIs.\nAn instance can contain many data elements. Each data element must refer to a single data file. Instance The instance model is the main metadata document in Altinn 3. It is used by Altinn to keep track of the state of an interaction between an end user and the owner of an app. An instance must be associated with an app and a reportee as the instance owner.\nInstances are also similar to file folders for other documents; forms and unstructured data collected during the lifetime of the instance. The number of documents and files being produced will depend on the app.\nIn a simple app, an end user will fill in a form and submit it to the application owner. This would typically produce a one way interaction where only one or two documents are collected in the instance. In more advanced apps the number of documents and files would extend to multiple forms, attachments, and feedback or validation messages from the application owner.\nAn instance cannot reference data directly, but will hold a list of data elements with more information about collected data.\nDataElement The DataElement model is a metadata document for a specific form or binary file. The most important aspects of this document is that it holds information about where the actual data is being stored, and how the data is being used by the application.\nMost apps will automatically create a data element to represent the form being filled out by the user. More advanced apps will also require the user to upload attachments or to fill in multiple forms.\nAn instance can have many data elements, but each data element cannot reference more than one data file.\nInstancesThe Platform API to work with instances\nDataThe Platform API for working with data elements.\nInstance eventsThe Platform API for working with instance events.\nOpenAPI (swagger) for Storage "

Single-digit millisecond response times, and automatic and instant scalability, guarantee speed at any scale. Business continuity is assured with SLA-backed availability and enterprise-grade security.\nAltinn 3 uses Cosmos DB to store metadata about data in Altinn.\napplications: applications dataElements: data elements instanceEvents: instance events instances: instance information leases: used by Azure Functions texts: Applications texts Azure CosmosDB is configured with one Write Region and one read region. This for redundancy.\nAzure CosmosDB provides automatic backup of the database. This is in additon to our custom backup.\nWe use autoscale to adjust the number of assigned RU.\nCosmos scaling Read more about Azure Cosmos DB\nPostgreSQL PostgreSQL is used at a relational database for Altinn Platform Events and for Altinn Repository.\nAzure Blob storage All data stored in Altinn Platform Storage for Apps are stored in a Azure Blob storage. This include formdata and all binary attachments.\nThe data is georeplicated between Norway East and Norway West\nGeo replication Azure Disks The Kubernetes Cluster uses disks for volumes\nWe use Azure Disk for storage in Kubernetes Cluster\nAzure Container Registries Azure Container Registry is a managed, private Docker registry service based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0. Create and maintain Azure container registries to store and manage your private Docker container images and related artifacts.\nIn Altinn 3 each org has their own Azure Container Registry where the images build of their applications are stored.\nACR overview In addition the platform itself has their own container registry\nRead more about Azure Container Registry\nAzure Key Vaults Azure Key Vault is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, or cryptographic keys. Key Vault service supports two types of containers: vaults and managed HSM pools. Vaults support storing software and HSM-backed keys, secrets, and certificates.\nEvery organization cluster has two keyvaults. One is target for secrets for applications. Secrets are added by the app developers as self services.\nThe other is targetet for secrets needed to be shared with Altinn Platform. Access token to storage accounts is one example\nAzure Queue Storage Azure Queue Storage provides cloud messaging between application components. In designing applications for scale, application components are often decoupled so they can scale independently. Queue Storage delivers asynchronous messaging between application components, whether they are running in the cloud, on the desktop, on an on-premises server, or on a mobile device. Queue Storage also supports managing asynchronous tasks and building process work flows.\nIn Altinn we use Azure Queue Storage for events processing and delegation.\nRead more about Azure Queue Storage\n"

	"description": "This guide provides a detailed general description of how an end user system can integrate with services developed on the Altinn 3 platform.",
	"content": "Overview of Altinn and End User Systems On the Altinn platform, various agencies and other public entities develop services to be used by citizens or businesses.\nThe services can range from simple, where a limited amount of data needs to be reported, to complex services with multiple types of data elements over several process steps.\nAn important feature of services developed in Altinn is that each service offers a set of APIs that can be used for machine-to-machine submission of data from end user systems.\nIn this context, an end user system is software that performs tasks on behalf of the end user (citizen/business), either fully automated or controlled by an end user.\nToday, approximately 50% of the data reported to Altinn is sent in this way from over 100 different software solutions.\nWhat is an Altinn Service? A service consists of an application that is available in Altinn\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure. This application has a set of configurations that describe the data the service will receive or send out, as well as the process the service has.\nExamples of services developed on the new Altinn 3 platform can be found here.\nWhat Types of Data Do Services Expose/Receive via API? The typical Altinn service has defined a schema model that describes the data relevant to the service.\nThis model is specified by the service owner who created the service. In addition to one or more schema models, a service may also have defined sets of attachment data that need to be included.\nOverall Submission Process The diagram below shows the overall flow of communication between an end user system and Altinn\u0026rsquo;s API.\nDetailed Technical Process Prerequisites For end user systems where end users will log in using ID-porten, the end user system must have a client registered as api_client in ID-porten. Documentation on how to register a client can be found here.\nLogin \u0026amp; Scopes For login, the end user system must send the end user to ID-porten for login using its configured client setup.\nThe scopes to request are altinn:instances.read and altinn:instances.write.\nThese scopes allow calling all apps in Altinn 3.\nAs part of the login process, the end user system will receive an access_token with information about the end user.\nSee the detailed login process with ID-porten and the screen presented to the end user here.\nExchange of Access Token to Altinn Token The next step in the process is to exchange the access_token from ID-porten for an Altinn Token.\nAn Altinn Token can be used against all service applications and relevant common components.\nThe exchange is done against the Authentication API.\nThe exchange is done by setting the Access Token from ID-porten as a Bearer token in the authorization header and making a GET call to the exchange endpoint where \u0026ldquo;id-porten\u0026rdquo; is used as the token provider.\nA detailed description of the exchange with ID-porten token can be found here.\nInstantiation and Submission of Data Once a valid token is obtained, one can instantiate (create a service instance) and submit data for the digital service.\nThere are mainly two flows to choose from here.\nInstantiation without Schema Data In instantiation without schema data, the first call to Altinn will only contain information about who is the submitter and which service is being instantiated.\nThis call is made to the Instance API on the app. (OpenAPI)\n{ \u0026#34;appId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;org/app\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instanceOwner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;personNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12247918309\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organisationNumber\u0026#34;: null } } The result is an instance with schema data that contains standard data and prefill data configured by the service owner.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instanceOwner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;partyId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;personNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;01039012345\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organisationNumber\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;: null }, \u0026#34;appId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd/become-application-owner\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;org\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selfLinks\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;apps\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://local.altinn.cloud/ttd/become-application-owner/instances/1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://local.altinn.cloud/storage/api/v1/instances/1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814\u0026#34;

} The system can choose to download data via the data API to add its own data or possibly just overwrite the schema created during instantiation. The ID for the auto-created schema must be used to overwrite.\nThe PUT interface for data is used to overwrite data. Data can be sent as XML or JSON.\nThis depends on how the schema definition is shared by the service owner.\nInstantiation with Multipart Form Data This way of instantiating involves sending information about the submitter, as well as data, in one and the same API call. The instance part is as in the example above.\nSchema data can be in XML format (most common so far) or JSON format.\nTypically, the service owner will communicate XSD/JSON Schema documentation to end user system providers via Altinn Digitalization or via their own channels.\nExamples of such channels are the website for the Tax Return Service and the VAT Service.\nIn addition to schema data, there may be one or more file attachments.\nThe example below shows multipart/form-data with instance information, schema data (model1), and attachment data (certificate).\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=\u0026#34;abcdefg\u0026#34; --abcdefg Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026#34;instance\u0026#34; { ... } --abcdefg Content-Type: application/xml Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026#34;model1\u0026#34; \u0026lt;xml\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/xml\u0026gt; --abcdefg Content-Type: application/pdf Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026#34;certificate\u0026#34;; filename=certificate.pdf %PDF-1.4 %Óëéá 1 0 obj ... --abcdefg-- Completion of Process Once the schema data and attachment data are fully completed, the end user system can complete the application process.\nA process can consist of one or more steps. Typically, a process flow consists of a step where data is uploaded and a new process step where data is confirmed.\nFor an end user system, this means that the following operations must be completed before the process is complete:\nConfirm Next on Data Step By sending PUT on NEXT on the process API, the service will validate the data and move the process to confirmation.\nIn case of data errors, an error message will be received.\nOne can then call the validation API to get details about the errors.\nConfirm Next on Confirmation Step When the data is validated OK, the service will be ready for confirmation. By making an additional PUT call to NEXT in this state, the service is completed.\nThe service owner is then notified that the process is complete and can process the data further.\n"

	"description": "To start using system users you must complete a few administrative steps and adapt your own solution.",
	"content": "Below is a high-level checklist of the steps a service owner and an end-user system vendor must complete to start using system users.\nService owner 1 Create service The service owner develops and documents the service that will use Altinn Authorization for access control 2 Choose authentication Maskinporten is one of the foundational components that system users build on. It guarantees authenticity and lets the service owner perform coarse-grained access management through scopes. The Maskinporten token is also the carrier of system-user information, which enables the service owner to enforce access control through Altinn Authorization.\nThe service therefore has to support Maskinporten, and at least one scope must be configured on the service.\nFollow the steps in the Samarbeidsportalen guide to enable Maskinporten for your service.\nThe Maskinporten token that contains system-user information does not reveal which end user performed an operation. When you need insight into the person performing an action, the service must also support ID-porten authentication.\n3 Register resource The Resource Registry stores the description of the authorisation resource and its access rules. Make sure the consumers of your service know which access packages (and any individual rights) they must request in order to access the service. See the resource creation guide for detailed instructions. 4 Integrate with Altinn Authorization For services that run outside Altinn you must call Altinn Authorization for access decisions. See the resource owner guides for implementation details. System vendor Maskinporten onboarding System users build on Maskinporten, which lets the service owner secure authentication and manage access to the service through scopes. The Maskinporten token also carries the system-user information used when Altinn Authorization evaluates access.\nYou need a Norwegian organisation number to get access to Maskinporten. See Maskinporten for details.\nBy signing the terms of use for Maskinporten and ID-porten you receive access to both the test and production environments.\nConnect to Maskinporten – follow the steps in Get started with Maskinporten. Create a Maskinporten client. You can do this in Samarbeidsportalen or via the API. Creating a client requires that the Maskinporten connection is in place. See the Maskinporten client guide. Gain access to the System User APIs By signing the terms of use for Altinn you gain access to both the test and production environments.\nFill in the registration form for end-user system vendors and tick off for system user to receive the required scopes:\naltinn:authentication/systemuser.request.read altinn:authentication/systemuser.request.write altinn:authentication/systemregister.write If the enduser system will use client delegations API\naltinn:clientdelegations.read altinn:clientdelegations.write Register the system in the System Registry To consume services through your end-user system, the system must be registered in the Altinn System Registry.\nRegistration is done via the API. The system must be linked to the Maskinporten client created in step 3.\nWhich access packages and/or individual services you need depends on the service you plan to consume – see the service documentation for details.\nThe current Altinn roles will be replaced by access packages. See access packages for more information.\nRequest access to the service owner\u0026#39;s APIs Each service owner decides which scopes are used for access control to their APIs. These scopes are different from the scopes that enable system user functionality and must be granted by the relevant service owner. Check the service documentation or contact the owner to learn which scopes to request. Adapt the system for your customers This step often takes some time because it involves your users. We recommend allocating sufficient time and involving users early.\nA system user is defined by the access packages the end-user system vendor selects. The possible access packages are those that were configured when the system was registered in the System Registry. To know which access packages a system user requires, you have to map the tasks your users perform and the services they need.\nSee the system user guides for detailed scenarios.\nConnect to and use the service owner\u0026#39;s APIs "

	"description": "Guide for system vendors on integrating with and setting up system users in their end-user system.",
	"content": "A system user is a virtual user that an organization can create in Altinn. It gives systems and software, such as an accounting program, access to retrieve and submit data on behalf of the organization. Actions performed via a system user are registered as being done by the system user, and can therefore not be linked to a specific person. If personal responsibility is required, one must log in using a standard Altinn login.\nBefore you start Before you create a system user for your end-user system, you must decide how the system will be used by the end-users – i.e., whether the reporting will be for their own organization or on behalf of other organizations. This choice determines how the integration with the service owner\u0026rsquo;s APIs is set up, and what permissions the system user will receive. The system can also be built to support both types of reporting. In such cases, you must create two separate system users: one for reporting on behalf of your own organization, and one for reporting on behalf of clients.\nCreating a system user The system user is created by the organization or service provider that wants to use an end-user system for integration with Altinn or other public services. Creation can be done via user-controlled creation or vendor-controlled creation.\nUser-controlled creation With user-controlled creation, it is the end-user themselves who initiates the process by logging into Altinn. There, the user selects which system they want to create a system user for.\nThe end-user is presented with the predefined permissions that the system requires. When these are accepted, the permissions are approved directly, and the system user is created without generating a separate request. This process requires that the end-user has the authority to delegate all the permissions the system requests.\nVendor-controlled creation With vendor-controlled creation, it is the end-user system vendor (SBSL) who initiates the process. This is done by the vendor, often from their own specialized system, sending a request to Altinn to create a system user.\nThe request specifies which permissions the system user needs. This request must then be approved by the end-user (the customer) in Altinn for the system user to be created.\nThis method is based on an \u0026ldquo;AND-relationship\u0026rdquo;. This means that the end-user must have the authority to delegate all the permissions the vendor requests. If the user lacks authority for even one of the permissions, the request cannot be approved in its entirety.\nSystem user for own system This option is suitable if the system will be used to retrieve or send data for your own organization. The figure shows vendor-controlled creation for an own system\nTypical use for end-user:\nThe end-user is an employee of the organization. The system is used only for reporting for their own organization number. No other organizations are involved. Example: An internal HR or accounting system that sends payroll reports (A-meldinger) or VAT returns for the organization.\nConsequence for end-user:\nReporting is done only for their own organization. Delegations from other organizations are not necessary. Access control is simple and linked directly to their own organization. System user for own system can be created using either user-controlled or vendor-controlled creation.\nSystem user for client system (previously agent-system user)\nThis option is suitable if your system will enable end-users to report for other organizations – for example, customers, clients, or partners.\nYou can get authorizations for the client in two ways:\nVia the Brønnøysund Register Centre (Enhetsregisteret): The service provider receives rights automatically when a relationship is registered in the Brønnøysund Register Centre. This applies to the roles Accountant (REGN), Auditor (REVI), and Business Manager (FFØR). These authorizations can then be client-delegated to a system user with corresponding rights.\nDelegation from organization to organization: An access manager at the client gives authorization directly to the service provider\u0026rsquo;s organization number. This happens by the client actively delegating one or more access packages. Once the service provider has received the authorization, their client administrator can further delegate this to a client system with corresponding authorizations.\nFigure shows vendor-controlled creation for a client system\nTypical use for end-user:\nThe end-user is an accountant, consultant, or service provider. They log into the system and can choose which client/organization they will report for. The system must support multiple organization numbers and handle delegations via Altinn or an equivalent solution. Example: An accounting firm that uses an accounting system to send VAT returns for its clients.\nConsequence for end-user:\nThe user can report on behalf of multiple organizations. The clients must have given the necessary rights/delegations. The system must ensure correct access and identification of who is being reported for. If the customer relationship is removed/deleted from the Brønnøysund Register Centre or the organization delegation is revoked by the client, all client delegations for that specific authorization will be automatically removed. Client delegation to a system user can be done via GUI or a separate API System users for client systems can only be created using vendor-controlled creation.\nSystem RegistrationThis guide describes how you, as an end-user system vendor, register a system in the system registry.\nCreate System UserThis guide shows how you, as an end-user system vendor, can create a system user for your own system and a system user for a client system.\nDelete System User Using System UserGuidance for system vendors on how to use a System User after it has been created.\nUser scenarios for system userOverview of relevant user scenarios for system users\nReference implementationThe SmartCloud demo client illustrates how vendor-controlled system user creation can be implemented end-to-end.\n"

	"description": "A guide for the API provider to set up their resource with Altinn and establishing the system user integration.",
	"content": "Prerequisites For The API Provider To use system user as an API-provider, the following prerequisites must be fulfilled:\nAgreement with Maskinporten as API-provider Agreement with Digdir for access to resource registry for creating resources Creation of necessary resources which must be authorized Assigned scope for PDP integration Integration with Altinn PDP Preparation by API Provider(service owner) (skatteetaten) Developing the Service/API The service owner (Skatteetaten) must first develop the API that will be used by external parties, in this case, the \u0026ldquo;Krav og betalinger\u0026rdquo; service. In this case it\u0026rsquo;s an api developed and maintained by the service owner on their platform. This API allows users to retrieve outstanding tax and fee claims from Skatteetaten. Configuring Access in Maskinporten Skatteetaten then creates a scope in Maskinporten (e.g., skatteetaten:kravogbetalinger). This scope is tied to the relevant access rights and is granted to organizations needing access to this service, such as SmartCloud AS (the system provider). Registering Resources in the Resource Register The final step for Skatteetaten is to register a resource in the Resource Register, linking it to the scope and defining the access rules for external users. The service can define custom scopes, with access managed directly by the service owner This could be an application developed in Altinn Studio or an API hosted on the service owner\u0026rsquo;s own platform. Refer api documentation for more information on available endpoints. Post System User Creation Validation of Maskinporten token The token itself is validated as a standardized Maskinporten token. Read more at Maskinporten.\nA system user token contains quite a few more details than a regular Maskinporten token.\nBelow is an example token.\nJWT Token { \u0026#34;authorization_details\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:systemuser\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;systemuser_org\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;authority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;iso6523-actorid-upis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0192:314168267\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;systemuser_id\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;ebe4a681-0a8c-429e-a36f-8f9ca942b59f\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;system_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;matrix_test\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;scope\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;krr:global/kontaktinformasjon.read\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;iss\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://test.maskinporten.no/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;client_amr\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;private_key_jwt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;token_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Bearer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;exp\u0026#34;: 1718175135, \u0026#34;iat\u0026#34;: 1718175015, \u0026#34;client_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;fc9a8287-e7cb-45e5-b90e-123048d32d85\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;jti\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;-SpfU--1Zn_Oqvkpjwu3oVn--VLcPzSAwjqyiP6zBEw\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;consumer\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;authority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;iso6523-actorid-upis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0192:314330897\u0026#34; } } Values that are important for an API provider are\nValue Meaning authorization_details:systemuser_id Unique ID for the system user. This is the value Altinn needs in order to authorize access. This is the one that has been delegated access rights. authorization_details:systemuser_org:id The organization that created the system user authorization_details:system_id Reference to the system that the system user points to. Consumer:id Organization number of the system provider (organization that has authenticated itself against Maskinporten) See also the documentation for system user at Maskinporten.\nAuthorization of System User API-provider must call PDP to authorize access to system user. This is done by sending a request to Altinn PDP.\nThe API provider must configure which actions and resources are accessed via the API in order to construct the complete request.\nBelow is an example of a call made by the system user a545ca29-7fb8-4810-a2f2-0be171cb2a26 attempting to perform a read operation on a resource of the type kravogbetaling for the organization 923609016.\n{ \u0026#34;Request\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ReturnPolicyIdList\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;AccessSubject\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Attribute\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;AttributeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:systemuser:uuid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;a545ca29-7fb8-4810-a2f2-0be171cb2a26\u0026#34; } ] } ], \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Attribute\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;AttributeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:action:action-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;read\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;DataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\u0026#34; } ] } ], \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Attribute\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;AttributeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;kravogbetaling\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;AttributeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:organization:identifier-no\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;923609016\u0026#34; } ] } ] } } Altinn PDP returns the response as an XACML JSON response, informing whether the request is authorized or not.\nThe API provider must have logic in their API to either reject or accept the request from the system based on this.\n{ \u0026#34;Response\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Decision\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Permit\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Status\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;StatusCode\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:status:ok\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;Obligations\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:obligation:authenticationLevel1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;attributeAssignment\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;attributeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:obligation-assignment:1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:minimum-authenticationlevel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;issuer\u0026#34;: null } ] } ] } ] } "

Read more on altinn.no\nAltinn Apps Altinn Apps is the infrastructure for running apps developed in Altinn Studio. Each organisation that is using Altinn Studio will have its own Altinn Apps Kubernetes cluster, isolated from other organisations.\nSee Altinn Apps application architecture or deployment architecture.\nAltinn CLI The command-line interface for the new APIs in Altinn.\nIs used by service owners for retrieving data submitted by users, for instantiating and for updating status.\nhttps://github.com/altinn/altinn-cli/\nAltinn Platform Altinn Platform contains reusable microservices with functionality that can be used by apps. Platform can also be used directly by service owner systems using Altinn CLI and Maskinporten.\nCurrently these microservices are part of Platform: Authorization, Authentication, PDF, Profile, Register, and Storage.\nAltinn Platform is running in its own Kubernetes cluster.\nSee Altinn Platform solution architecture and [deployment architecture]\nAltinn environment An Altinn environment is an isolated group of several Altinn solutions functioning together.\nAT - Acceptance testing of Altinn Studio, Altinn Apps, Altinn Platform and SBL. TT02 - App/service test environment used by the app and service owners. Production - The production environment. Altinn Studio Altinn Studio are our tools for app development.\nConsists of Altinn Studio Designer, Altinn Studio Repos and a local code editor / development tool (e.g. Visual Studio Code).\nLets the developers create, edit, test and deploy applications. The apps are deployed as containers to a seperate infrastructure called Altinn Apps.\nhttps://altinn.studio\nAltinn Studio Designer Altinn Studio Designer is a web-based tool for creating, editing and deploying apps.\nIn Designer, it should be easy to create apps by re-using and configuring pre-made components.\nAltinn Studio Repos Altinn Studio Repos is the solution where each app is stored and versioned as a Git repository.\nNo matter which tool is used for development (Designer, Code, or something else), the app is stored in Repos.\nApi Application Programming Interface.\nApp Short for Application. App is the name that is given to an app. It is used as repository name, as part of AppId and in different metadata. Inside an org, the app needs to be a unique name. See also Application.\nDeprecated terms: AppName Service\nAppId An AppId identifies a given application. It has the following pattern [org]/[app-name]. The app-name is the same as the name of the app repo.\nApplication An application created in Altinn Studio is called an app, short for application. Apps are deployed to an Altinn Apps environment. The app provides two things:\nan interactive user interface for users wishing to submit data to an organisation, e.g. to fill out a form manually, to read information or to sign an agreement; an api that client applications can interact with. The application also has a metadata representation in the application repository (platform storage), which defines the various element types that an instance of an application can have.\ndeprecated term: Service\nApps Short for Altinn Apps. See Altinn Apps\nApplication Developer A user developing applications in Altinn Studio.\nOrg Short for organisation. Organisation is the entity responsible for an app. Typically identified by an unique acronym, e.g. SKD, NAV, OSLK.\nDeprecated terms: Application Owner Service Owner\nData A representation of a data element which is stored in the Altinn Platform.\ndeprecated term: FormElement?\nEvent A record of activites on a specific instance.\nInstance An instance of an application for a specific instance owner, is represented as an object. Is created by an organisation or instance owner. It contains information of the formdata and attachments stored associated with the instance.\ndeprecated term: ReporteeElement\nInstance Owner The person or entity that is responsible for submitting an instance of an application to an organisation.\ndeprecated term: Reportee\nUser The user which is logged in in Altinn and performs actions on behalf of an instance owner. A user and an instance owner can be the same entity.\nKubernetes A system for managing docker containers. See also: Relevant definitions within Kubernetes\nReact The framework used for developing UI components.\nPAP Policy Administration Point.\nPDP Policy Decision Point.\nPEP Policy Enforcement Point.\nPIP Policy Information Point.\nPRP Policy Retrieval Point.\nSBL The Altinn 2 end user solution (SluttBrukerLøsning).\nSBL Bridge Applicaton that exposes SBL components as REST interface to Altinn Platform components. See all issues on GitHub related to SBL Bridge.\nStateful App A stateful app uses Altinn Platform to store data\nStateless App A stateless app is an application where no data is stored in the platform. This could be an app acting like a proxy to some external API. State could potensially be stored in the external API, so the term stateless is limited to how the App is not using any state in Altinn Platform.\nProcess The set of tasks a certain app is made of, i.e. data, signing, payment etc. In Altinn Studio we use a *.bpmn file for the process.\ndeprecated term: Workflow\nXACML XACML stands for \u0026ldquo;eXtensible Access Control Markup Language\u0026rdquo;. The standard defines a declarative fine-grained, attribute-based access control policy language,[2] an architecture, and a processing model describing how to evaluate access requests according to the rules defined in policies.\nAltinn Studio Apps uses the XACML standard for defining Policies for apps, the authorization architecture, and the request and response between PEP and PDP.\n"

You can obtain the token using /Home/GetTestSystemUserToken in localtest or visit the webpage /Home/Tokens.\nInstance Delegation Instance delegation is supported in the latest version of localtest, but the users/submitters you delegate instances from and to must have an associated partyUuid. See the example file below.\nApp-specific users If the default set of users doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit your needs when testing your app locally, you can configure your app to respond with a JSON document at the URL /[org]/[appId]/testData.json. The simplest way is to place the file at App/wwwroot/testData.json\nTypical customizations you might be interested in include using alternative organization numbers or personal identification numbers, ensuring lookups in APIs your app depends on function correctly, or testing authorization rules with roles different from those assigned to the default users.\nJson Structure The JsonSchema helps you write a testData.json file in an IDE such as VSCode. A full version of users from the TestData-folder is available in testData.json\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/test-users/test-users.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;persons\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;partyId\u0026#34;: 512345, \u0026#34;partyUuid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;48153af4-265f-4b35-8ed9-232fafbc716e\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ssn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;01017512345\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;firstName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ola\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;middleName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Nordmann\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customClaims\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some:extra:claim\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;claimValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;valueType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\u0026#34;

	"content": "Once you have finished configuring access rules for the consent, you need to validate that the consent works as expected in the service. This is done by verifying that the rights specified in the consent token (under consentRights) match the rights required by the service.\nIn the new consent solution for Altinn 3, Maskinporten issues the consent token. The token is issued as a regular Maskinporten token, but additionally contains an attribute called authorization_details. This field contains information about which rights the consent grants and is used by the service to verify that the necessary consent has been given.\nThe example below shows a consent token from the demo application Smartbank in the TT02 test environment. Here we can see that the token has received the consent samtykke-test-vegard for the income year 2022. This confirms that the consent setup works as expected:\n{ \u0026#34;authorization_details\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:consent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;93413201-b7e8-4ec3-a899-580fc02c6aeb\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;from\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:person:identifier-no:25922947409\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;to\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;authority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;iso6523-actorid-upis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0192:991825827\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;consented\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2025-07-18T07:57:30.409251+00:00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;validTo\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2026-07-18T07:57:15.639509+00:00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;consentRights\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;action\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;consent\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;resource\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;urn:altinn:resource\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;samtykke-test-vegard\u0026#34; } ], \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;inntektsaar\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2022\u0026#34; } } ] } ], \u0026#34;scope\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;altinn:consentrequests.read\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;iss\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://test.maskinporten.no/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;client_amr\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;private_key_jwt\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;token_type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Bearer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;exp\u0026#34;: 1752825571, \u0026#34;iat\u0026#34;: 1752825451, \u0026#34;client_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;107c6f58-e06b-44e9-be7a-11ea44c7ad8b\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;jti\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;T2KUt3ufgIPycdoGPMEFU87pNm9e9nPB1ODkJj5wH0k\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;consumer\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;authority\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;iso6523-actorid-upis\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ID\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;0192:991825827\u0026#34; } } Validation of converted consents As part of the migration process from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3, Altinn will automatically convert existing consents.\nThis means that service providers must be prepared to handle three different types of consent tokens:\nExisting Altinn 2 tokens - Old consent tokens that are still valid New Altinn 3 tokens - Tokens based on new resource definitions created by the service owner Migrated tokens - Tokens for services that were originally consented to in Altinn 2, but are now converted to Altinn 3 format Responsibilities and configuration work Altinn takes responsibility for the actual conversion of resources and migration of consents. However, the service owner must configure their API to accept tokens with migrated resources.\nResourceID for migrated resources follows the format: {org}_{serviceCode}_{serviceEditionCode}\n"

	"description": "How to add logic to validate form data?",
	"content": "Introduction Validations ensures that the user\u0026rsquo;s input is valid with regard to the data model, in addition to all custom rules that are set up for the application. Validations can be run either on the client- (the browser) or the server-side.\nValidations can also be set up to trigger on page navigation.\nClient-side validation This is validation that is run in the browser, before data is sent to server for saving. This makes it possible to give quick feedback to the user during the process of filling out the form.\nClient-side validation is based on the data model of the form, and uses this to determine what is valid input in a field. Specifically, the JSON schema version of the data model is used for validation. This is automatically generated when uploading an XSD. It is possible to make changes in the JSON schema file directly to adapt the validation when needed.\nNote that if you make changes in the JSON schema manually, and then update the XSD and re-upload it, a new JSON schema will also be generated and all manual adaptations will have to be remade. It is therefore recommended to make changes in the XSD and/or the data modeling tool for these changes to be reflected in the JSON schema.\nAn example of how a field can be defined in the JSON schema data model is:\n\u0026#34;someField\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxLength\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4\u0026#34; } Input in this field will be validated towards the limits that are set, and an error message will appear if these are not met - in this case, if input is a text longer than four characters.\nDefault error messages Default error messages has been set up for all validations done on the client-side. See the overview below.\nRule Error message bokmål Error message nynorsk Error message english minimum \u0026lsquo;Minste gyldig verdi er {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Minste gyldig verdi er {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Minimum valid value is {0}\u0026rsquo; maximum \u0026lsquo;Største gyldig verdi er {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Største gyldig verdi er {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Maximum valid value is {0}\u0026rsquo; minLength \u0026lsquo;Bruk {0} eller flere tegn\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Bruk {0} eller flere tegn\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Use {0} or more characters\u0026rsquo; maxLength \u0026lsquo;Bruk {0} eller færre tegn\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Bruk {0} eller færre tegn\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Use {0} or fewer characters\u0026rsquo; length \u0026lsquo;Antall tillatte tegn er {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Antall tillatte tegn er {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Number of characters allowed is {0}\u0026rsquo; pattern \u0026lsquo;Feil format eller verdi\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Feil format eller verdi\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Wrong format or value\u0026rsquo; required \u0026lsquo;Du må fylle ut {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Du må fylle ut {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;You have to fill out {0}\u0026rsquo; enum \u0026lsquo;Kun verdiene {0} er tillatt\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Kun verdiene {0} er tillatt\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Only the values {0} are permitted\u0026rsquo; More about error messages for required fields For a smoother user experience, error messages for missing data in required fields won\u0026rsquo;t be displayed automatically while filling out a form, unless validation is triggered for a single field, when saving a row in a repeating group or when navigating to another page.\nThe error message for required fields is as defined above, \u0026ldquo;You have to fill out {0}\u0026rdquo;. The {0} symbol is replaced with the field that the error message is shown for. This is done in the following way:\nIf shortName text is defined for the component, this is used. This is a new text that is currently used only for this specific error message. If the shortName text is not defined, the title text for the component is used - this is the components label text. The text will be converted to use a lowercase letter first, unless the text looks like an acronym. In some special cases (Address component) where there are multiple fields within the component, the default labels for the fields is used. Example: Component with only title { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text-firstName\u0026#34; }, ... //etc } With resource texts:\n... { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text-firstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;First name\u0026#34; } The error message would then be \u0026quot;You have to fill out First name\u0026quot;.\nExample: Component with shortName If the field\u0026rsquo;s prompt is long or not suitable for use in the validation message, you can add a shortName text that can be used instead. Note that this only applies to this specific validation message - the shortName text is not used otherwise in the solution as of now.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text-firstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;shortName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firstName-short\u0026#34;, }, ... //etc } With resource texts:\n... { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text-firstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Please type your first name in the field below:\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firstName-short\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your first name\u0026#34; } The error message would then be \u0026quot;You have to fill out your first name\u0026quot;.\nReplacing the required validation message completely If you want to replace the default error message for required fields completely, you can do this by adding the text key requiredValidation to the components textResourceBindings object. This will replace the default error message for required fields. The text can be a text key for a text defined in the resource files for multilingual support.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text-firstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;requiredValidation\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myCustomRequiredValidation\u0026#34; }, ... } Custom error messages It is possible to define custom error messages that will be displayed when a field doesn\u0026rsquo;t pass the validation check. This is done by including a parameter errorMessage where the field is defined in the JSON schema. The JSON schema file is in the folder App/models and has a naming patterns as follows; *.schema.json,\nAn example of how to extend the example previously presented with a custom error message:\n\u0026#34;someField\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxLength\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;errorMessage\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myCustomError\u0026#34; } The error text can be included directly. To enable language support, add a text key for a text defined in the resource files.\nNotice that if you have a reference to a definition the error message must be added to the property-field and not the reference/definition. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;person\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;$ref\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;#/definitions/personDefinition\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;errorMessage\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myCustomError\u0026#34;, } }, \u0026#34;definitions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;personDefinition\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;number\u0026#34; }, ... } } Note that when the XSD is changed, the custom error messages will de removed from the JSON schema. In the future, there will be support for setting custom error messages in the data modelling tool in Altinn Studio. But for now, this is a manual job. Server-side validation Server-side validation can be split into two categories:\nValidations against data model - These run automatically whenever the user attempts to submit form data. Custom validations - these are written by the application developer, and run when the user attempts to submit form data or move the process to a new step. How to add custom validation Custom validation can also be split into two categories; task-validation and data-validation.\nTask-validation will run each time validation is triggered either manually from the application or when you attempt to move forward in the process. Data-validation will run if you\u0026rsquo;re on a step that has defined data elements associated with it. Validation for process navigation will run after any user action, if an action is specified. This is because the result of the action may be what makes the task valid. If validation on process next was done before the action, this would lead to a soft-lock.\nValidations are written i C# and depending on the version of the application template and Nuget packages you are using, the way the implementation is done varies slightly. In the earlier versions it\u0026rsquo;s a pre-created file where you put your logic, while from version 7 and onwards you implement an interface in whatever class you like. The interface happens to be equal to the pre-defined class in the earlier versions. The examples below which referrers to the methods to add your validation logic to is the same.\nv7 In version 7 the way to do custom code instantiation has changed. We now use an dependency injection based approach instead of overriding methods. If you previously used to place your custom code in the ValidateData and ValidateTask methods in the ValidationHandler.cs class you will see that it\u0026rsquo;s mostly the same.\nCreate a class that implements the IInstanceValidator interface found in the Altinn.App.Core.Features.Validation namespace.\nYou can name and place the file in any folder you like within your project, but we suggest you use meaningful namespaces like in any other .Net project. Register you custom implementation in the Program.cs class services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IInstanceValidator, InstanceValidator\u0026gt;(); This ensures your custom code is known to the application and that it will be executed. v4, v5, v6 Validations should be added to the ValidationHandler.cs-file in the application template. The file can be accessed and edited in Altinn Studio through the logic menu, by selecting Rediger valideringer, or directly in the application repo where the file is under the logic/Validation-folder. From here on the examples should be valid for all versions:)\nCustom logic are added to the ValidateData and ValidateTask-methods. The former takes in a data object and the latter takes in the instance and taskId. To add a validation error, the AddModelError-method of the validationResult-object, which is a parameter in both methods, is used.\nAn example of a simple data validation that tests that the field FirstName does not contain the value 1337, when the root element of the model is Skjema is shown below:\npublic void ValidateData(object data, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (data.GetType() == typeof(Skjema)) { // Cast instance data to model type Skjema model = (Skjema)data; // Get value to test - FirstName string firstName = Skjema?.Person?.FirstName; // Check if FirstName exists, and contains the value \u0026#34;1337\u0026#34; if (firstName != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; firstName.Contains(\u0026#34;1337\u0026#34;)) { // Add validation error, with error message and list // of affected fields (in this case Person.FirstName) validationResults.AddModelError( \u0026#34;Person.FirstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Error: First name cannot contain the value \u0026#39;1337\u0026#39;.\u0026#34; ); } } } See comments in code above for an explanation of what the different parts do.\nIn the other parameter of the method AddModelError, where it says \u0026ldquo;Error: First name cannot contain the value ' 1337\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;, you can use a text key for a text defined in the resource files for multilingual support.\nAn example of a simple task validation that checks how long the user spent on Task_1 and returns an error if there has gone more than three days:\npublic async Task ValidateTask(Instance instance, string taskId, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (taskId.Equals(\u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;)) { DateTime deadline = ((DateTime)instance.Created).AddDays(3); if (DateTime.UtcNow \u0026lt; deadline) { validationResults.AddModelError(\u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, $\u0026#34;Completion of Task_1 has taken too long. Please start over.\u0026#34;); } } } Single field validation Single field validations are shown immediately when the user fills out a field.\nv4 (App Frontend) Setting the showValidations property on a component will cause validations to become visible immediately when they occur.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-input-field\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;showValidations\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;AllExceptRequired\u0026#34;] } Where showValidations contains a set of validation types to check; this can be one or more of:\nSchema Component Expression CustomBackend Required AllExceptRequired All Note: \u0026quot;showValidations\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;AllExceptRequired\u0026quot;] is the default value if the property is not set. To avoid showing any validations immediately, set showValidations to an empty array [].\nv3 (App Frontend) NOTE: Trigger for validation on single fields in Stateless apps is not currently supported. Note that in version 3 of app frontend, JSON schema and component specific validation is run automatically by default, adding the validation trigger causes custom backend validation to be run as well.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-input-field\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;validation\u0026#34;] } The configuration above will result in your own custom validation in ValidationHandler.cs being triggered each time the field is updated. If you need to know which field triggered the validation, this is available in the http-context as a header of the request named ValidationTriggerField.\nAn example of a custom validation where the header value is retrieved is shown below.\npublic async Task ValidateData(object data, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext .Request.Headers .TryGetValue(\u0026#34;ValidationTriggerField\u0026#34;, out StringValues triggerValues); string triggerField = triggerValues.FirstOrDefault(string.Empty); if (triggerField.Equals(\u0026#34;kommune\u0026#34;)) { // Cast instance data to model type flyttemelding model = (flyttemelding)data; // Get value to test - Kommune string kommune = model.kommune; if (!kommune.Equals(\u0026#34;Oslo\u0026#34;)) { validationResults.AddModelError(triggerField, \u0026#34;This is not a valid municipality.\u0026#34;); } } await Task.CompletedTask; } NOTE validation of single fields should be implemented in a way where it is both run on triggers and during general validation. The example that revolves multiple complex validations show how this can be implemented.\nSeveral things has been done to get this code to run\nIn ValidationHandler.cs using Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives; is included at the top of the file to be able to use StringValues. In App.cs using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http; is included at the top of the file to be able to use IHttpContextAccessor. In App.cs IHttpContextAccessor is dependency injected in the constructor and passed along to ValidationHandler. public App( IAppResources appResourcesService, ILogger\u0026lt;App\u0026gt; logger, IData dataService, IProcess processService, IPDF pdfService, IProfile profileService, IRegister registerService, IPrefill prefillService, IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor // \u0026lt;--- Add this line ) : base(appResourcesService, logger, dataService, processService, pdfService, prefillService) { _logger = logger; _validationHandler = new ValidationHandler(httpContextAccessor); // \u0026lt;--- Include the new property here _calculationHandler = new CalculationHandler(); _instantiationHandler = new InstantiationHandler(profileService, registerService); } If there are multiple complex validations that are time consuming, it is recommended to implement several private methods to validate these and use ValidationTriggerField to determine which private method is to be run. You can e.g. use a switch statement to accomplish this.\npublic async Task ValidateData(object data, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (data is flyttemelding model) { _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext .Request.Headers .TryGetValue(\u0026#34;ValidationTriggerField\u0026#34;, out StringValues triggerValues); string triggerField = triggerValues.FirstOrDefault(string.Empty); switch (triggerField) { case \u0026#34;kommune\u0026#34;: ValidateKommune(model, validationResults); break; case \u0026#34;boaddresse\u0026#34;: ValidateBoAdresse(model, validationResults); break; default: ValidateKommune(model, validationResults); ValidateBoAdresse(model, validationResults); break; } } } private void ValidateKommune(flyttemelding model, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (model.kommune != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !model.kommune.Equals(\u0026#34;Oslo\u0026#34;)) { validationResults.AddModelError( nameof(model.kommune), \u0026#34;This is not a valid municipality.\u0026#34;); } } private void ValidateBoAdresse(flyttemelding model, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (model.boaddresse != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; model.boaddresse.Length \u0026gt; 150) { validationResults.AddModelError( nameof(model.boaddresse), \u0026#34;Address can not be longer than 150 characters.\u0026#34;); } } Specify that validation errors are fixed When validation is triggered by a single field, all former validations on this field will be removed pending a response from the last validation. If a field triggers validation that updates/adds an error message to multiple fields at once, these will not be removed even when there no longer are any errors in these fields. This is because there is no way to know which fields may have been validated through a single field validation.\nFor example, if you have two fields; first name and last name. Both fields trigger single field validation, and if both fields have a value, you can validate that the full name can not be longer than 50 characters. An error message is then set on both fields. If you correct this by changing the first name, the error message from first name will disappear, but the error message on the last name field will still be displayed even though the validation does not set any error messages on the fields.\nprivate void ValidateFullName(Datamodell model, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (!string.isNullOrEmpty(model.fornavn) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !string.isNullOrEmpty(model.etternavn) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; model.fornavn.Length + model.etternavn.Length \u0026gt; 50) { validationResults.addModelError(nameof(model.fornavn), \u0026#34;Full name can not be longer than 50 characters.\u0026#34;); validationResults.addModelError(nameof(model.etternavn), \u0026#34;Full name can not be longer than 50 characters.\u0026#34;); } } To be able to remove old error messages in a case like this, there has been added support to be able to specify that a validation error has been fixed. Then, the field in question will be able to be notified that a specific error message that it is displaying has been fixed and can now be hidden.\nThis is done by adding a validation error in the code in the case where there are no errors in the validation, and set *FIXED* in front of the error message itself. This corresponds to the setup for soft validation. This prefix causes the error message that is set to be removed from the field in question, or ignored (if there is no error message on the field already).\nYou can now expand the example above to support this:\nprivate void ValidateFullName(Datamodell model, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (!string.isNullOrEmpty(model.fornavn) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !string.isNullOrEmpty(model.etternavn) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; model.fornavn.Length + model.etternavn.Length \u0026gt; 50) { validationResults.addModelError(nameof(model.fornavn), \u0026#34;Full name can not be longer than 50 characters.\u0026#34;); validationResults.addModelError(nameof(model.etternavn), \u0026#34;Full name can not be longer than 50 characters.\u0026#34;); } else { validationResults.addModelError(nameof(model.fornavn), \u0026#34;*FIXED*Full name can not be longer than 50 characters.\u0026#34;); validationResults.addModelError(nameof(model.etternavn), \u0026#34;*FIXED*Full name can not be longer than 50 characters.\u0026#34;); } } If you are having trouble with getting this to work, and you are instead seeing validation messages that include the *FIXED*-prefix, double check that you have \u0026quot;FixedValidationPrefix\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;*FIXED*\u0026quot; set under GeneralSettings in appsettings.json.\nSoft validations Soft validations are validation messages that does not stop the user from submitting or move onto the next step of the process, but that are used to give the user different forms of information. These types of validations can for example be used to ask the user to verify input that seems wrong or strange, but which strictly speaking is not invalid, or give useful information for further filling out the form.\nMessages based on soft validation will be displayed once, but the user can choose to move on without making any changes.\nSoft validations are added from the server-side the application logic, in the same way as regular validation errors. The difference is that the validation message must be prefixed with the type of validation you want to give, e.g. *WARNING*. This will be interpreted as a soft validation. The prefix *WARNING* will not be displayed for the user.\nThe different types of soft validations are WARNING, INFO and SUCCESS.\nCode example\npublic async Task ValidateData(object data, ModelStateDictionary modelState) { if (data is TestModel testModel) { string firstName = testModel?.Person?.FirstName; if (firstName != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; firstName.Contains(\u0026#34;1337\u0026#34;)) { validationResults.AddModelError( \u0026#34;Person.FirstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;*WARNING*Are you sure your first name contains 1337?\u0026#34;); } if (firstName != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; firstname.Contains(\u0026#34;Altinn\u0026#34;)) { validationResults.AddModelError( \u0026#34;Person.FirstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;*SUCCESS*Altinn is a great name!\u0026#34;); } } await Task.CompletedTask; } Examples on display of different validations below:\nExample on information message (*INFO* - prefix) Example on success message (*SUCCESS* - prefix) Example on warning message (*WARNING* - prefix) Group validation It is possible to check validations in a repeating group when the user saves a row in the group. If there are validations errors in the row, the user is prevented from closing that row until the errors are fixed.\nv4 (App Frontend) { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;demo-gruppe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [...], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 9, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;validateOnSaveRow\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;All\u0026#34;], } Where validateOnSaveRow contains a set of validation types to check; this can be one or more of:\nSchema Component Expression CustomBackend Required AllExceptRequired All v3 (App Frontend) { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;demo-gruppe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [...], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 9, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {...}, \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;validateRow\u0026#34;] } If you add validation trigger on the group component, a call will be made towards the validation back-end with a header specifying which component triggered the validation: ComponentId. Additionally, the row index of the row being saved is available in the header RowIndex. If the group is a nested group, a comma separated list of row indices is returned, otherwise it is a single number. Validations are written in C# in the ValidationHandler.cs-file in the application template. In the validation, you can retrieve component id and tailor possible validations to run in the back-end, example:\npublic async Task ValidateData(object data, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (data is flyttemelding model) { _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext .Request.Headers .TryGetValue(\u0026#34;ComponentId\u0026#34;, out StringValues compIdValues); _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext .Request.Headers .TryGetValue(\u0026#34;RowIndex\u0026#34;, out StringValues rowIndexValues); string componentId = compIdValues.FirstOrDefault(string.Empty); switch (componentId) { case \u0026#34;top-level-group\u0026#34;: // run validations specific to the group // Get row index for a non-nested group int rowIndex = int.Parse(rowIndexValues.FirstOrDefault(string.Empty)); break; case \u0026#34;nested-group\u0026#34;: // Get all row indices for a nested group int[] rowIndices = rowIndexValues .FirstOrDefault(string.Empty) .Split(\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries) .Select(s =\u0026gt; int.Parse(s)) .ToArray(); break; default: // run the validations in their entirety break; } } } For tips on how you solve complex validations, see the examples under single field validation.\n"

	"content": "For a high-level overview of upcoming changes, you can check out the roadmap.\n\u0026gt;3.37.2 Changelog for app-frontend can now be found on Github Releases.\n3.37.2 (2022-05-20) - Dependency patching Patching of external dependencies for week 20 of 2022.\n3.37.1 (2022-05-15) - Fix for prefills when using preselectedOptionIndex When using preselectedOptionIndex on a field which is used to determine later dynamic prefills (or when clicking really fast), the wrong prefills could end up being used. Issue #8255.\n3.37.0 (2022-05-15) - Support for tracks in stateless apps Stateless apps can now utilize tracks. Requires version 5.1.0 or later of nuget packages. Issue #8347.\n3.36.4 (2022-05-10) - Fix in validation of required field in hidden groups (again) After the last fix, released in version 3.35.2, the problem would persist if the fields were hidden individually instead of hiding the entire group. This additional vector has now been fixed. Issue #6398.\n3.36.3 (2022-05-10) - Only reference description if the field exists Fixes a bug where components had defined aria-describedby to a element that did not exist. Issue #23.\n3.36.2 (2022-05-06) - Fixed a potential crash after failing validation from server Fixes a recently introduced bug where some failing validations passed from the server could crash the app instance. Issue #8481.\nPatching of external dependencies for week 18 of 2022.\n3.36.1 (2022-05-06) - Fix in validation of required fields in repeating multi-page groups Fixes a bug where required fields inside multi-page repeating groups were being marked with errors even when no instances of the repeating group had been added. Issue #7478.\n3.36.0 (2022-05-03) - Added support for dynamics in nested repeating groups. Added support for dynamics in nested repeating groups. Issue #55.\n3.35.2 (2022-05-02) - Fix in validation of required field in hidden groups Fixes a bug where hiding a non-repeating group with required fields could display a message asking the user to fill the invisible required fields. Issue #6398.\n3.35.1 (2022-04-28) - Dependency patching Patching of external dependencies for week 17 of 2022.\n3.35.0 (2022-04-28) - Marking required fields Changed default behaviour of marking optional fields to now mark required fields with * as default. Optional fields have no marking as default behaviour, but this can be configured using the labelSettings property of the field, see here.\n3.34.4 (2022-04-28) - Removed out-of-place heading in receipt when there are no attachments When PDF generation has been disabled and there are no attachments, the heading indicating there should follow a list of attachments has also been hidden. Issue #8296.\n3.34.3 (2022-04-28) - Bugfixes for caching of lasted visited view Fixes a bug where stateless app would use a shared key for persisting the last visited view. Also fixes an issue where an empty page would be displayed if the persisted layout id was no longer present. Issues #7897 and #6975.\n3.34.2 (2022-04-25) - Fixed colors in radio and checkbox The colors for radio and checkbox borders were not adhering to accessibility requirements from WCAG 2.1. These colors have been adjusted slightly to follow standard theme colors. Issue #11.\n3.34.1 (2022-04-22) - Fixed invalid HTML attribute in ImageComponent The width attribute on img element can only be a number that represents px. We have support for other units, f.ex %. The width declaration was moved to inline styling instead to resolve this issue. Issue #14.\n3.34.0 (2022-04-11) - Options from the data model Added possibility to setup options from repeating groups in the data model. Read more on docs. Issue #7626.\n3.33.5 (2022-04-11) - External dependency patching Patched external dependency to fix security issue. Pull request #8371.\n3.33.4 (2022-03-31) - Webpack 5 + dependency patching App frontend is now bundled with webpack 5. Also patched some external dependencies. Issue #5073.\n3.33.3 (2022-03-25) - Support for defining row or columns for checkbox and radio Added support for defining row or columns layout for radio and checkbox. Issue #5730.\n3.33.2 (2022-03-24) - Adjusted height of input fields and date picker The height of these fields was incorrect. They are now set to 36px height. Issue #7377.\n3.33.1 (2022-03-23) - Bugfix for dynamic options Fixed bug where only fist options fetched when two components reference same optionId but with different mapping. Issue #8292.\n3.33.0 (2022-03-18) - New text in Confirm view + possible to customize New text for confirm.sender in confirm view. Now also possible to override this text.

	"description": "Overview of changes introduced in v1.0.62-alpha -- 2.0.1",
	"content": "2.0.0 (2020-11-18) - Auto delete on process end For some apps, the fact that there\u0026rsquo;s traces of it in the user archive (and the data is stored) is a problem (e.g. for security reasons). The Altinn.App.* packages has been updated to support auto delete when process ends. This is introduced with version 2.0.0-alpha of the packages.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.3.1 (2020-11-06) New layout structure in Designer In order to support multiple pages in an app we have done some restructuring of the app-template. When you are doing changes in Altinn Designer for your app the updated FormLayout.json will be put under the new structure. For apps that have nuget references to Altinn.App.Api, Altinn.App.Common, and Altinn.App.PlatformServices with versions below version 1.2.0 this will make the app unable to find the FormLayout.json on the network call against the app.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.1.11-alpha (2020-10-02) - Registration of events The Altinn.App.* packages has been updated to work with the new Events component in Altinn.

See the entry in breaking changes\n1.1.0-alpha (2020-10-01) - Deleting instances from endpoint in app #4871 was fixed with in release of 1.1.10-alpha of the app nugets. This change only affects users and app owners that try to delete an instance.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.1.8-alpha (2020-09-23) - Update path of Data Protection Keys for Apps #4483 changed the way we use data protection keys in order to improve the support for running locally. These keys are used in XSRF-protection. When you are running apps locally, we are using the default behaviour (directory under current user) for .Net Core. The path is passed with an environment variable when running in an apps cluster. This change requires the deployment.yaml file to be updated with the correct variable.\nThe change affects all application created in Altinn Studio before 30.09.2020 using Altinn.App.PlatformServices 1.1.8-alpha and above Updating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.1.2-alpha (2020-07-15) - Namespace renamed A namespace was renamed in Altinn.App.PlatformServices Version=\u0026ldquo;1.1.2-alpha causing the build of the application to fail if references to this namespace isn\u0026rsquo;t changed. This affects all applications created before June 2020 that reference nuget versions \u0026gt;= 1.1.2-alpha.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.1.0-alpha (2020-07-01) - Multiple changes Property type changed for UserProfile.ProfileSettingPreference Introduced with issue: #4466 and release v2020.28.\nThe change affects all applications in TT02 and PR with nuget version 1.0.98 and lower.\nNew endpoint for application text resources Introduced with issue: #4451 and nuget 1.1.0.-alpha.\nThe change affects all application created in Altinn Studio before 8.07.2020 using nuget versions 1.1.0-alpha\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files.

See the entry in breaking changes\n1.0.82-alpha (2020-05-15) - Updated client-side validation Introduced with issue: #3944, and applies to existing apps that upgrade to the new major version of app frontend (v2).\nThe client-side validation of the app frontend has been replaced with a JSON-schema validation in order to provide a more complete client-side validation. As of v2 of app frontend, client-side validation has support for type-checking basic types, including enums. When upgrading the frontend version to v2, the app must use nuget versions 1.0.82-alpha or newer.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.0.80-alpha Removed GET operations with body Introduced with issue: #3738.\nThe Register API had a few GET operations that took an input parameter through the body of an http request. Requests against these operations would work in AT environments, but would be broken by API Management in production like environments. The operations in question has now been removed and replaced with operations that require POST requests.\nErrors The methods that have been removed were used by an app when an instantiation were done by the Application owner. More specifically if the instanceOwnerPartyId were unknown. The instantiation request would then have the Person number or organization number instead, and the Register operation would be used to identify the correct party id.\nPOST https://{org}.apps.tt02.altinn.no/{app-id}/instances/ { \u0026#34;appId\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;org/app\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instanceOwner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;personNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12247918309\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organisationNumber\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;instanceOwnerPartyId\u0026#34;: null }, ... } How to fix Any issues related to this change can be fixed by upgrading to the latest version of Altinn.App.PlatformServices. This means the App must be updated and a the new version deployed to all environments. Existing instances are not affected.\n1.0.78-alpha Send-in / Validation fails with \u0026lsquo;Ukjent feil\u0026rsquo; Introduced with issue: #3927.\nThere was a vulnerability in the solution allowing to update a whole instance object using an endpoint in app backend or storage. This has been solved by refactoring app backend and removing the endpoints.\nAny issues related to validation failing with \u0026lsquo;Ukjent feil\u0026rsquo; for apps with nuget packages older than 1.0.78-alpha can be solved by upgrading to 1.0.78-alpha or newer.\n1.0.62-alpha (2020-03-13) Data and task validation Introduced with issue: #3820.\nThe base class that every application inherits has been altered to allow for both data and task validation.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n"

	"description": "Overview of changes introduced in version 3.",
	"content": "3.5.1 (2021-03-11) - Possible to get rule configuration for apps with layout sets There was a bug resulting in av 404 response whenever it is attempted to retrieve the rule configuration for an application while specifying the layout set id in the request. This has now been fixed.\n3.5.0 (2021-03-10) - Added functionality for pdf generation for application owner Up until now a pdf copy has not been generated for the tasks that are completed by the application owner. This has now been implemented and pdf should be generated after a task regardless if it is an end user of the app owner that completes the task.\n3.4.0 (2021-03-10) - Endpoint and functionality for get page order made available All apps now expose an endpoint for getting the current page order based on the current state of an instance. Default behavior is to return the page order as defined in Settings.json to override, add the function below in Logic/App.cs and include your own logic.\npublic override async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { return await _pdfHandler.FormatPdf(layoutSettings, data); } 3.3.0 (2021-03-04) - Retrieving certificate from Key Vault now uses name The ISecret service now requires certificate name as input for retrieving a certificate from key vault. Previously this has been the certificate id, but this identificator contains more information that an app developer might have available, so the service has been simplified.\n3.2.3 (2021-02-17) - Fixed duplicate key exception on options When using the same option key in an option result a duplicate key exception was thrown that crashed the app. This is now fixed, and keys that already exist in the option result will not be added.\n3.2.1 (2021-02-10) - Correctly set unread status when instantiated by end user The instance now appears as read in the messagebox if it is instantiated by an end user through api, regardless if they have opened the instance in GUI or downloaded the form data they just posted.\n3.2.0 (2021-02-02) - Options displayed with label in PDF Before this release the selected option was shown with it\u0026rsquo;s value rather than the label that the end user was presented with during form filling. This has now been fixed so the label is displayed in the pdf.\n3.1.6 (2021-01-29) 3.1.5 (2021-01-27) 3.1.4 (2021-01-26) 3.0.4 (2021-01-26) - Swagger support for Apps We have added Swashbuckle to the App. It is a library that brings Swagger support and this is especially handy when developing an HTTP based API. It creates a form of interactive documentation based on the OpenAPI Specification. To describe the APIs better, we use the xml documentation file.\nThis documentation will be generated automatically when the application is build. Existing APIs and new APIs created in the app will be documented.\nThe documentation will appear at https://[org].apps.altinn.no/[org]/[app]/swagger/index.html in the app.\nTo enable this, there\u0026rsquo;s some changes.\nUpdated package dependencies, generate xml documentation file and copy xml documentation for Altinn.App.Api Navigate to you application repository and find App.csproj in the App folder.\nUpdate nuget dependencies in App.csproj to version 3.0.4, add new property for Altinn.App.Api.\n\u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Api\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;3.0.4\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;CopyToOutputDirectory\u0026gt;lib\\$(TargetFramework)\\*.xml \u0026lt;/CopyToOutputDirectory\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/PackageReference\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Common\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;3.0.4\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.PlatformServices\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;3.0.4\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; This is new in App.csproj\n\u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Swashbuckle.AspNetCore\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;5.6.3\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyGroup\u0026gt; \u0026lt;GenerateDocumentationFile\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;/GenerateDocumentationFile\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NoWarn\u0026gt;$(NoWarn);1591\u0026lt;/NoWarn\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/PropertyGroup\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Target Name=\u0026#34;CopyXMLFromPackagesForBuild\u0026#34; AfterTargets=\u0026#34;Build\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ItemGroup\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReferenceFiles Condition=\u0026#34;%(PackageReference.CopyToOutputDirectory) != \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#34; Include=\u0026#34;$(NugetPackageRoot)$([MSBuild]::Escape(\u0026#39;%(PackageReference.Identity)\u0026#39;).ToLower())/%(PackageReference.Version)/%(PackageReference.CopyToOutputDirectory)\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ItemGroup\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Copy SourceFiles=\u0026#34;@(PackageReferenceFiles)\u0026#34; DestinationFolder=\u0026#34;$(OutDir)\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Target\u0026gt; Changes to the Startup.cs file.

This version of the app template packages have a new person lookup client that can be used to perform lookups with the new endpoint in Register.\n4.31.1 (10.03.2022) - Fixed bug related to prefill and enriched instance events with person identification number This release fixes a bug where prefilling the same value to more than one field throws a duplicate key exception. This has been solved by flipping the prefill dictionary. Person identification number has been included to the platformUser data of an instance event. 4.30.0 (07.03.2022) - Support for readiness og liveness probes An endpoint dedicated for health check has been implemented. This is used by Kubernetes to know when an instance of the application is ready for load.\nAll applications created before 16.06.2022 must be manually updated to enable the readiness and liveness probes.\nIn App/Startup.cs\nAdd the line using Altinn.App.Core.Health; amongst the using-statements at the top of the file\nIn the function ConfigureServices, add the line\nservices.AddHealthChecks().AddCheck\u0026lt;HealthCheck\u0026gt;(\u0026#34;default_health_check\u0026#34;); In the function Configure add the line\napp.UseHealthChecks(\u0026#34;/health\u0026#34;); In deployment/Chart.yaml the reference to the Altinn Helm Chart should be updated to version 2.1.0\nThe final result should resemble this:\napiVersion: v1 description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes name: deployment version: 1.1.0 dependencies: - name: deployment repository: https://charts.altinn.studio/ version: 2.1.0 In deployment/values.yaml under deployment, add\nreadiness: enabled: true liveness: enabled: true NOTE indentation is important in yaml files. readiness og liveness must be on the level below deployment, and at the same level av volumeMounts og volumes.\n4.27.0 (23.02.2022) - Secure options endpoint Add support for secure options endpoints Fixed url and parameter separator logic in GetInstanceEvents Change redirect url from string to base64 encoded string\n4.26.0 (2022-02-10) - Improvements to text resource in relation to PDF Use new appName text resource as PDF title. Use local texts for pdf generation instead of text resources from Platform Storage.\n4.25.0 (2022-01-24) - Dynamic application settings for front end Added a new section called FrontEndSettings for use in appsetting.{environment}.json files. This is made available for front end as applicationSettings and is a dynamic list of values. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to add new entries to FrontEndSettings without the usual need to make code changes in backend. The feature ensures that backend can provide environment specific values to the front end application.\n4.24.0 (2020-01-21) Support language and query parameters in dynamic options. New way of implementing dynamic options by creating a class that implements IAppOptionsProvider. See doc\n4.23.0 (2022-01-15) - Updated backend support for BPMN gateways Restructure of process engine and support for BPMN gateways\n4.22.0 (2022-01-07) - Included access token generation for eFormidling integration point The integration point used for sending instance data through eFormidling now required a valid access token. Apps now fulfill all requirements of the integration point.\n4.21.0 (2021-12-01) - Added support for saving username for instance owner If a self identified user instantiates an instance, their username is saved in the instance owner metadata.\nAdded Api in App to expose XACML Policy and BPMN Process\n4.20.0 (2021-11-18) - Added support for custom redirect URL when exiting an app The URL to an app can now contain a query parameter (returnUrl) which, if validated (valid URI and host name), can be used to redirect the user to that URL when the user clicks on the exit icon in an Altinn 3 app. Read more about it here\nRelated to 7183\n4.19.0 (2021-11-15) - Added support for instantiation based of a copy of an archived instance The app template now supports the instantiation of an app based on a copy of an archived instance. The new endpoint is documented here. Note that support for copying an app in the message box and configuration of the application through Altinn Studio is still under development.\nRelated to 6695\n4.18.0 (2021-11-10) - Added support for OIDC configuration You can now configure a specific OIDC provider in app.\nRelated to 7173\n4.17.2 (2021-10-27) - Added API for instantiation with key-value prefill It is now possible to instantiate with keyValue prefill through a new instantiation API.\nYou can also use prefill in custom code. This will require that the app implements the latest version of App.cs which includes the following method\npublic override async Task RunDataCreation(Instance instance, object data, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { await _instantiationHandler.DataCreation(instance, data, prefill); } And the latest InstansiationHandler.cs with the method signature\npublic async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { await Task.CompletedTask; } 4.16.0 (2021-10-07) - Added API for tagging of data elements It\u0026rsquo;s now possible to save tags on a data element. To support this there are 3 new API endpoints for listing existing tags, adding a tag, and to remove a tag from a data element.\nThis change is associated with issue 6861 on github.\nThere is more information about the new API under the app API documentation.\n4.15.2 (2021-10-04) - New endpoint for retrieving active instances Altinn Apps now expose a new endpoint for retriveing active instances for a given instance owner. The new endpoint can be reached at {org}.apps.altinn.no/{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/active.\nThe change is related to issue 6767.\n4.14.1 (2021-09-22) - 500 error when retrieving non existing instance fixed There was a bug causing a 500 response when an request is made towards Get/Instances for a non-existing instance. This has now been fixed and the response returned is 403. Swagger for the endpoint is updated to reflect possible response codes.\n4.14.0 (2021-09-13) - Partial support for namespace XML The code that deserializes XML has been updated to support namespace declaration in the root element.\nExample:\n\u0026lt;Skjema xmlns=\u0026#34;urn:no:altinn:skjema:v1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Navn\u0026gt;Altinn\u0026lt;/Navn\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Skjema\u0026gt; Deserialization occurs when an external system uses the app API to submit a new form, when they overwrite an existing form, and when an app retrieves a form from blob storage.\nThe change is not automatically used by all apps that update to this version. For the change to take properly effect the C# class that represents the model must be updated. The class needs to be decorated with an XmlRootAttribute with the Namespace property set to the correct namespace.\nExample:\n[XmlRoot(ElementName = \u0026#34;Skjema\u0026#34;, Namespace = \u0026#34;urn:no:altinn:skjema:v1\u0026#34;)] public class Skjema { [MaxLength(100)] [XmlElement(\u0026#34;Navn\u0026#34;)] public string Navn { get; set; } } This change must be done manually for all old and new models. The model editor in altinn.studio has not be updated to do this automatically.\n4.13.0 (2021-09-03) - Event for changed sub status on instance Changing the sub status of an instance triggers an event app.instance.substatus.changed which can be subscribed to in the event component.\nThis solves issue #6691\n4.12.0 (2021-08-27) - Identity data is included in the request telemetry for all requests In Application Insights we now register the properties listed below enabling linking of an entity to a specific request received by the application.\npartyId authentication level userId organisationNumber This solves issue #5983\n4.11.1 (2021-08-26) - No longer possible to cache response from stateless apps Caching of the stateless data responses is no longer possible.\nThis solves issue #6532\n4.11.0 (2021-08-03) - Support for disabling reportee selection in Altinn Portal Apps now support adding query parameter DontChooseReportee=true to disable the reportee selection when an unauthorized user accesses an app. The result being that the user will represent themselves and be routed directly to the application after login.\nThis release solves issue #6573.\n4.10.2 (2021-07-15) - Text resources are loaded locally The app will now load texts from the locally stored text resource files (config/texts/*) instead of retrieving them from Storage. Texts are still uploaded to Storage during deploy. The change is to remove unnecessary calls to Storage and to avoid an issue with caching that prevented new texts from being used immediately. #6466, #6415 Fixed a bug where a filename with space in it could lead to a crash. #6421 New apps created after the v2021.29 release will provide security headers like X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, and Referer-Policy. To activate this in existing apps follow these steps: Open the App/Startup.cs file. At the top of the file add the namespace reference: using Altinn.App.Api.Middleware; Find the Configure method and add the statement: app.UseDefaultSecurityHeaders(); Add it right before existing app.Use* statements. E.g. before app.UseRouting(); 4.9.2 (2021-07-08) - Fixed messages from multipart request validation Validation messages from multipart request validation was misleading. This release solved issue #6418.\n4.9.1 (2021-07-02) - Bugfix for errors in multipart validation Fixed a bug that caused validation messages to show C# type of DataType rather than DataTypeId. Issue #6418\n4.9.0 (2021-06-29) - Support for marking a single field validation error as fixed It is now possible to mark a previous validation error as fixed by using the prefix *FIXED* in front of the original error. Documentation on how to implement the functionality.\n4.8.0 (2021-06-22) - Application version number available in AppSettings During app deployment an environment variable with the app version number/name is added to the app runtime environment. This version information can now be retrieved in any controller or service through the AppSettings configuration object. Just add a dependency on AppSettings into the class and access the new property called AppVersion.\n4.7.1 (2021-06-15) - Adjustments to response headers Some of the controllers exposed by the applications have been modified to not allow caching and/or storage of their responces in the client.\n4.7.0 (2021-06-08) Altinn Apps now authorize access for statless apps.\nAltinn Apps now have two new application events where application developers can add data processing logic. calculation, population, and more.\nIn this update the RunCalculate application event is made obsolete/deprecated. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended that Apps are updated to use RunProcessDataWrite and RunProcessDataRead instead. Calls to the RunCalculate method will be removed in a future update.\nThe process to update is\nAdd the DataProcessing folder and DataProcessingHandler class from our app template to your app. Update App.cs. Add a class field for DataProcessingHandler and copy new methods ( RunProcessDataRead and RunProcessDataWrite) from App.cs Move logic from calculation handler to DataProcessinghandler Remove RunCalculation method from App.cs Remove CalculationHandler when code has been moved to DataProcessingHandler. Compile and test your app. See details about data processing here\n4.6.2 (2021-06-01) - Duplicate keys in options causing crash This release has a fix for a crash related to PDF rendering when an app have options with duplicate entries. #5887\n4.6.1. (2021-05-21) Changed alternative subject Altinn Apps now uses org instead of organization as subject when publishing events.\n4.6.0 (2021-05-11) - Apps now support data fields Altinn Apps now support data fields. Data fields allows for adding data values, from either form fields or a custom source, to the instance object. Form data can be added by configuring data fields in applicationmetadata.json while custom sources require coding. Documentation on how to add data values to an instance can be found here.\n4.5.2 (2021-05-04) - Endpoints for stateless data elements exposed through app. Bug stopping local testing fixed Altinn Apps now expose endpoints for creating, prefilling and running calculations on stateless data elements. A stateless data element entails there is no link to an instance or instance owner, and the data is simply presented to the end user, but not persisted in any database.\nIn addition, a bug breaking apps running with local test introduced in 4.4.1 has been fixed.\nInformation on the new endpoints can be found in the swagger exposed by each application https: //{org}.apps.altinn.no/{org}{app}/swagger\n4.4.1 (2021-04-30) - Ask user to upgrade security level An app would show the \u0026ldquo;unknown error\u0026rdquo; message if a user were trying to access an instance with a security level that was too low for the instance. This has been fixed. The user is now sent to authentication with the option to pick an authentication method that provides a higher security level. The fix targets the GET instance endpoint specifically.\n4.4.0(2021-04-27) - Performance fix Improved performance.\n4.3.0 (2021-04-28) - Apps now support presentation fields Altinn Apps now support presentation fields. By specifying presentation fields in applicationmetadata.json, specified data values from the form data will be stored on the instance in order to show them along with the app title in the Altinn messagebox. Further documentation on how to configure presentation fields is found here.\nThis change is related to this epic.\n4.2.0 (2021-04-19) - Possible to integrate an app with eFormidling Altinn Apps now support integration with eFormidling. Documentation on how to set up an application to use eFormidling will be published once an integration point for eFormidling is set up in Altinn Platform.\n4.1.0 (2021-04-07) - Add new property with updated data to response for PUT to DataController During PUT of data to DataController ({org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId:int}/{instanceGuid:guid}/data), any calculations that are defined by the apps are run, and data is potentially updated before being saved. Previously, the response returned only the metadata for the updated data element, and a GET to fetch the updated data was necessary. In this version, a dictionary of all the fields that have updated data from calculations is returned as a new parameter in the API response (in addition to the data element metadata), so that clients do not need to perform the additional GET request in order to get the updated data.\nThis change is related to this issue.\n4.0.3 (2021-03-23) - Fixed a bug reading filename from Content-Disposition The specification for Content-Disposition specify that filename should be in quotes. This was not supported by the app backend API, causing requests following the specification to fail. This has been fixed. Added support for filename* (FilenameStar). If Content-Disposition contain both filename and filename*, the value defined by filename* will be used. 4.0.1 (2021-03-15) - Upgraded application to .Net 5 and grouped references of Altinn App and Altinn Platform services in Startup.cs Altinn.App.* libraries target .Net 5 now, which requires that the application does the same. In addition we have created two methods for referencing all app and platform services in Startup.cs\nSee breaking changes for how to update you app to be compatible with this version.\n"

Ref. upcoming feature for selecting language 5.1.0 (23.05.2022) - Support for anonymous stateless apps Features This release makes it possible for users to access a statelss apps without being logged in. This is particularly useful for guides where users answer various questions in order to be guided to the correct solution but you as a service owner don\u0026rsquo;t need a stored instance as the result of the process the users went through.\nThe ability to use Altinn 2 options from an Altinn 3 apps. This is useful for migration scenarios and where a corresponding Altinn 3 options are not available.\nBugfixes A fix for tracks not working with stateless apps. A fix where a null pointer exception was thrown in /{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/active when the instance was initialized from api. A fix allowing any content type when content type is unspecified. "

You can make a copy of an existing app in Altinn Studio. This is done from the dashboard.

**Note:** To make a copy, you must have permission to create new repos in the organisation. Members of the teams **Owners** and **Developers** have these permissions. If you lack write access, you must contact the administrator for your organisation.

1. Click the **...** icon to the far right in the row of the app you want to copy.
2. Select **Lag kopi** from the menu.
3. Enter the name you want for the new app. The name is used to identify the app, and is also used as the repo name and in URLs and APIs. The name should be short and descriptive, such as "sick-leave" or "local-election-2025".

   _You cannot change the name after the app has been published._

4. Click **Lag kopi**. You will be automatically redirected to the new app, and can now start developing.

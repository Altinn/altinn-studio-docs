## Before you start

Consider the following before starting the technical implementation.

### Functional requirements

- You must have access to create, develop and deploy apps owned by an organisation.
- You must have an existing Altinn form (app A) where you have identified the data to be forwarded to app B.
- You must know who the instance owners are, meaning which roles and access they have.

### Technical requirements

- Your apps must use version 8 or newer of the Altinn NuGet packages.
- The organisation must have an existing Maskinporten client with the correct Altinn-specific
   scopes: `altinn:serviceowner/instances.read` and
   `altinn:serviceowner/instances.write`*
- You must have an integration between the app and the clients in Maskinporten. You must do this in the apps
   that will send requests to another app, where the app owner must authorise the requests.*

If steps 2 and 3 are missing, see
[Maskinporten-App Integration](/en/altinn-studio/v8/guides/integration/maskinporten/)

\* _If the end user of app A has the necessary roles to create app B on behalf of the intended
recipient, you can skip these technical requirements._

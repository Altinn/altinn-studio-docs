You can also use the help text field to explain rules, terms or explain why the information is necessary.

### Guidelines:
- Help texts are placed together with a label or title that needs further explanation. 
- If information contained in a helper text is needed in order to answer the form correctly, **do not** use a help text, as required information should be placed in an info text in the UI (below the header).

### Example of use:

<iframe style="border: 3px solid rgb(0 0 0 / 90%);border-radius: 9px;" width="100%" height="550" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/b2w3PuS5c0w8vVU3z8KOwp/Altinn-Studio-Komponenter?page-id=7669%3A75779&node-id=8014-35112&node-type=frame&viewport=960%2C660%2C0.33&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

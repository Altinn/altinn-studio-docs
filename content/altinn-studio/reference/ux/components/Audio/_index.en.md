## Usage

The Audio component is used to display an audio player in your application. It can be used standalone or as a media
component within other components like [Cards](../cards).

When used within a Cards component, the Audio component can be referenced in the `media` property of a card to display
an audio player at the top or bottom of the card.

### Anatomy

A standard audio player typically includes:

1. Play/pause button
2. Progress bar
3. Current time and duration display
4. Volume control
5. Download button (optional)

### Related

### Add component

{{<content-version-selector classes="border-box">}}
{{<content-version-container version-label="Altinn Studio Designer">}}

You can add a component in [Altinn Studio Designer](/altinn-studio/getting-started/) by dragging it from the list of
components to the page area.
Selecting the component brings up its configuration panel.

{{</content-version-container>}}
{{<content-version-container version-label="Code">}}

Basic component:

{{< code-title >}}
App/ui/layouts/{page}.json
{{< /code-title >}}

```json{hl_lines="6-"}
{
  "$schema": "https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/4/schemas/json/layout/layout.schema.v1.json",
  {
    "data": {
      "layout": [
        {
          "id": "myAudio",
          "type": "Audio",
          "source": "https://example.com/audio.mp3",
          "title": "Audio title",
          "description": "Audio description"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

{{</content-version-container>}}
{{</content-version-selector>}}


## Examples

### Using Audio in a Cards component

The Audio component is commonly used as a media component within Cards. Here's an example of how to reference an Audio
component in a Cards component:

{{< code-title >}}
App/ui/layouts/{page}.json
{{< /code-title >}}

```json
{
  "id": "myCards",
  "type": "Cards",
  "minWidth": "250px",
  "minMediaHeight": "150px",
  "mediaPosition": "top",
  "cards": [
    {
      "title": "Audio Example",
      "description": "This card displays an audio player",
      "media": "myAudio"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the `media` property of the card references the ID of an Audio component (`myAudio`) defined elsewhere
in the layout.

{{% notice warning %}}

Altinn Events enables event driven integration patterns, designed specifically to ***avoid*** the need for 
continuously requesting resources, also known as 'polling'. <br/> <br/>
However, in order to allow for smooth and incremental architectural migrations, 
the Events API also provides an HTTP API for scheduled requests of the same event data you hopefully
will receive via webhooks in the future.

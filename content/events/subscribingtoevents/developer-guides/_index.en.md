{{% notice info %}}
Developer guide should contain a step-by-step description of how to acheive a goal. </br> </br>
We do not want to duplicate documentation. Link to already existing documentation or consolidate in new places
if required. </br> </br>

- Which API, request body, headers and so on...

This might be used as inspiration: https://docs.altinn.studio/technology/architecture/capabilities/runtime/integration/events/scenarios/
Page should be deleted once we have full developerguides.

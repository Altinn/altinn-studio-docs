## Requesting required Maskinporten scope*

The scope __altinn:events.subscribe__ is required when subscribing to events. \* 

Currently, access to this scope is limited to the development team and beta testers of generic events. 
If you fall under one of these two groups and require access, please contact the development team directly. 

We are currently working on opening up requests to this scopes available to the public. 
[The progress of this work can be monitored here](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-events/issues/319).


\* Scope is only required when subscribing to events published to a non-Altinn App resource.

## Requesting required Maskinporten scope

The scope __altinn:events.publish__ is required when publishing events to Altinn. 

Currently, access to this scope is limited to the development team and beta testers for non-Altinn App events. 
If you fall under one of these two groups and require access, please contact the development team directly. 

We are working on making requests for access to this scopes available to the public. 
[The progress of this work can be monitored here](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-events/issues/319).

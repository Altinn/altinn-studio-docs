The Altinn Events API is an HTTP-based RESTful API that provides endpoints and actions for publishing of events and subscribing to events from Altinn 3 Apps and other registered sources.


## Base URL

- AT (Private Altinn Acceptance Test environment)
 
    ```http
    https://platform.{environment}.altinn.cloud/events/api/v1
    ```
- TT02 (Application owner test environment)
 
    ```http
    https://platform.tt02.altinn.no/events/api/v1
    ```
- Production:

   ```http
    https://platform.altinn.no/events/api/v1
    ```


## Authentication & Authorization
### Altinn token
The Events API is secured using OAuth2 and all requests must include a valid Altinn token either in the Authorization header or
in the _AltinnStudioRuntime_ cookie.

Here is an overview of guides related to the generation of Altinn token for production and test purposes:

### Maskinporten scopes

TODO: find docs to link to or create them.
{{% /notice %}}

Some endpoints in the API require additional authorization in the form of a 
Maskinporten scope. [User documentation on setting up a maskinporten integration with a specific scope 
is available here](). 


### Platform Access token
The use of some endpoints in the API is limited to callers within the Altinn eco-system.
These APIs require additional authorization in the form of a
Platform Access Token. Reference developer documentation for the client system on how to generate 
the token.


### Private APIs
The API contains a set of private APIs that are only accessible within the Events-component.
These are marked as _Private API_ in the OpenAPI specification and require an access token in the request header.

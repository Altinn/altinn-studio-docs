description: Reader access to Altinns APIs is required for those who want to access events
---

## Events from Altinn Studio apps 
Read and subscriber access to events from apps, requires access to the event source.
Access is therefore managed through the policy of the app. There are no restrictions on the use of the API.

## Events from other event sources - not apps
Using the API requires the scope: **altinn:events.subscribe**
This scope is available for any clients defined in Maskinporten or ID-porten

Access to the actual events is described through the access policy for the event source

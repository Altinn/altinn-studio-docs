### resourceFilter*
- filter for the event resource

When subscribing to an app event format for source filter is `https://digdir.apps.altinn.no/digdir/demoapp`

\* required for subscriptions on generic events, optional for app event subscriptions
\** only required for app subscriptions in the case where no resource filter is provided 

### Optional subscription request properties

#### subjectFilter

#### alternativeSubjectFilter
- filter for the cloud event's alternative subject

#### typeFilter

Omit this property if you want to subscribe to all events types for the given source and/or resource

## Response

A successful subscription registration should result in a 201 created response with the
[subscription](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Altinn/altinn-events/main/src/Events/Models/Subscription.cs)
serialized as a JSON string in the response body.

The 201 response code does indicate whether or not the subscription has been validated.
Altinn will only start pushing events to a subscription endpoint once the subscription endpoint has been validated.
You may retrieve your subscription by using the subscription ID to ensure that you subscription has been validated ok.


### Content-Type
- application/json

### Response codes
- 201 Created: The subscription has been successfully registered.



- 401 Unauthorized: Indicates a missing, invalid or expired authorization header or that consumer is not allowed
  to subscribe to events from this resource based on filter parameters
- 403 Forbidden: Indicating is missing required scope for subscribing to events

## Examples

### Request

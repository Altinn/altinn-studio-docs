In general, access to events for a given party will be authorized based on roles the requesting organization/user have for the subject of the event.


## Generic events
Granting a subscriber access to your published events is done through the policy of the 
resource in the resource registry. In order to query events or setup subscription the authorization policy has to grant the "subscribe" action.

## Altinn App events

Granting subscribers access to events generated by an Altinn App is done through the application's
authorization policy. 

Please reference [the Altinn Apps documentation](/en/altinn-studio/v8/reference/configuration/authorization/) for guidance.

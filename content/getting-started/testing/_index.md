Testing is available once a data model has been uploaded to the service. 

1. Select _Test -> Manuell_ in the top navigation menu. 
2. Select a test user from the list of available users.
3. Choose to start a new instance, or to reuse an existing instance (if any are available).
   By using an existing instance, data used in a previous instance can be re-used.

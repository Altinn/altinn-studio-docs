### Text resources
Texts are stored in resource files for the service. Texts can come from common libraries, from the data model, and be added manually. These texts are available for example when editing a form components properties, and selected texts will be shown to the end user.

#### Add/edit texts for the service
In the top navigation menu, select _UX_ -> _Tekster_ to go to the text editing page. 
An overview of the texts that are already available for the service is shown.

On this page, existing texts can be changed and new texts can be added. Add a new text by clicking _Ny tekst_, and enter the text and a unique identifier for the text. 

Save any changes by clicking _Lagre tekster_.

### Navigate to existing service
All services are displayed on the service dashboard. Navigate to a specific service by selecting the service from the dashboard.

### Navigating within a service

There are two navigation menus for a service, a top menu and a side menu (left side). The top menu allows navigation between functional areas of a service. The left menu is used for navigation within each functional area:

- About the service (_Om_)
  - About the service
  - Roles and rights
  - Production information
  - Version history
  - About the end user
  - Altinn.no
- Making the service (_Lage_)
  - Data model
  - GUI
  - API
- Languages for the service (_Spr√•k_)
  - Texts
  - More languages
- Testing the service (_Teste_)
  - Test
- Deploying the service (_Publisere_)
  - Deploy to production
  - Status

In addition to the two menus, there is also a blue top navigation menu. This menu is being phased out as new functionality is added. Use this menu when the guide specifies it.

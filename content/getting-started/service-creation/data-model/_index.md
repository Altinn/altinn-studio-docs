### Upload/view data model
The data model defines the data that can be submitted in the service. Currently the data model format must be XSD (Seres or OR).

The data model needs to be uploaded for each service. 

1. Open the service from the dashboard
2. Choose _Modellering -> Datamodell from the top navigation menu
3. Click on _Velg XSD_ and choose an XSD in the file explorer
4. Click _Last opp_

The data model XSD is then parsed, and all necessary files are generated. These files can be viewed by selecting the different tabs displayed on the data model page. There is also a visual representation (tree view) of the data model available on this page.

## API operations {#altinn-3-broker-application-services}

An overview of the application services of Altinn 3 Broker is given in the following figure:

![Altinn 3 Broker Application Services](altinn3-broker-application-services.en.png "Altinn 3 Broker Application Services")

Each of these application services correspond to a _path_ in the [Altinn 3 Broker OpenAPI specification][Altinn 3 Broker OpenAPI specifications].


## Event notifications (machine-to-machine)

Notifications about new messages and other events are delivered to webhook subscribers. 
The specific events are specified as part of the [Altinn 3 Broker OpenAPI specification][Altinn 3 Broker OpenAPI specifications]. 

Summary:

* filetransferinitialized: Information about a new file transfer
* filedeleted: The file has been deleted from Broker
* fileneverconfirmeddownloaded: File was never confirmed downloaded by a recipient
* uploadprocessing: File has been uploaded and is being processed
* published: File has finished processing and is ready for download
* uploadfailed: An upload failed either during upload or processing
* downloadconfirmed: A recipient confirmed their download
* allconfirmeddownloaded: All recipients have confirmed the download
*

<!--
Webhooks are a way for an app or a service to provide real-time information to other apps or services. They are used to trigger automatic reactions or notifications when specific events occur. Essentially, a webhook sends an HTTP POST request to a specified URL in response to an event — for example, when a new record is added to a database, or a user completes a purchase.

How Webhooks Work:
1. Event Occurrence: A webhook is configured to listen for certain events in a source application (e.g., a new post on a blog, a new payment received, a new user registration).
2. Notification: When the specified event occurs, the source application generates an HTTP POST request. This request contains information or data related to the event, formatted in a way that the receiving application expects (usually as JSON or XML).
3. Listener: The target application (or a server-side script) listens for incoming POST requests on a specified URL (the webhook URL).
4. Action: Once the target application receives the data, it can use it to perform an action, update its own database, send a notification, or trigger other workflows.

Advantages of Webhooks:
* Real-Time: Webhooks provide a mechanism for real-time data transfer and event handling, as opposed to traditional polling mechanisms where an application repeatedly checks for updates at regular intervals.
* Efficient: They are more efficient than polling because they only send data when there is an actual event, reducing unnecessary network traffic and server load.
* Customizable: Webhooks can be configured to listen for specific events, making them highly customizable and flexible for various use cases.

Considerations:
* Security: Since webhooks involve sending data from one service to another, they need to be secured to prevent unauthorized access or data interception. This often involves validating the incoming requests and using HTTPS for encryption.
* Error Handling: The receiving application needs to be capable of handling errors or exceptions that may occur during data processing. This includes dealing with malformed data, service downtime, or network issues.
* Infrastructure: The server that receives the webhook must be set up to handle potentially high volumes of incoming HTTP requests and process them efficiently.

## End user notifications (email, SMS)
Notifications to end users about new messages, files, and other events are sent via the Altinn Notification Service.

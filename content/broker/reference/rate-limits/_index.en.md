## Rate limits

We have introduced the following rate limits to balance the resource usage per party and avoid overloading the infrastructure. Using Events/Webhooks in your solution should eliminate the need for polling many of these operations.

Rate limit applies per subscription key (Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key). Contact us for more capacity.

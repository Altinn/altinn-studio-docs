## Migration to a future proof technology platform
The Altinn 2 Broker solution is being reimplemented along with other solutions on the Altinn platform
to transition to a cloud based technology platform in Altinn 3.

The development of the Altinn 3 Broker solution began in 2023. By mid-2026,
service owners and users should be transitioned to the new solution. 
The Altinn 2 platform will then be shut down.

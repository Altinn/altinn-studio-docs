## What is Altinn Broker?

The main use case for Altinn Broker is Managed File Transfer (MFT). It
facilitates secure transmission of files of any size from one sender
to one or more recepients. As such, it offers many
benefits compared to alternative ad-hoc peer-to-peer file transfer
solutions typically built on file transfer protocol (FTP), 
hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) or secure file transfer protocol (SFTP).

While transfer of individual files is the main use case and original purpose of
Altinn Broker, Altinn 3 Broker has been designed with some more advanced
use cases and possible future extensions in mind. Advanced
use cases and possible extensions are further described in separate
sections.

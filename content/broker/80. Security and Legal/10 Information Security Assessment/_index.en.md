## General considerations
Altinn Broker is content-agnostic. This means that Altinn Broker does not inspect,
modify, or otherwise process the content of the data (files) it handles. 
Its primary function is as an intermediary to facilitate the
secure transmission of data between entities, 
such as businesses and Norwegian government agencies.

List of potential security threats that Altinn Broker, or similar
systems facilitating data transmission and processing, might face:

1.  Interception and Eavesdropping: Threat actors could intercept data
    during transmission, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive
    information.

2.  Data Breaches: Vulnerabilities in the system could be exploited to
    access and extract confidential data, leading to data breaches.

3.  Identity Theft and Impersonation: If authentication mechanisms are
    weak, attackers could impersonate legitimate users, gaining
    unauthorized access to sensitive functions and data.

4.  Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
    Attacks: These attacks aim to overwhelm the system, making it
    unavailable to legitimate users.

5.  Insider Threats: Employees or contractors with malicious intent or
    negligent behaviors could cause significant security incidents,
    either by leaking data or by inadvertently creating vulnerabilities.

6.  Non-compliance with Legal and Regulatory Standards: Failure to
    adhere to laws and regulations like GDPR could lead to legal
    penalties and loss of trust.

7.  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Attackers could position
    themselves between the user and the server to intercept or alter
    data being transmitted.

8.  Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks: These attacks target users
    to gain sensitive information like passwords or to manipulate them
    into performing certain actions.

9.  Malware and Ransomware Attacks: Malicious software could be used to
    disrupt services, steal data, or encrypt data for ransom.

10. SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): If Altinn Broker uses
    web interfaces or APIs, these common web vulnerabilities could be
    exploited to steal data or compromise the system.

11. Configuration and Patch Management Flaws: Poorly configured systems
    or outdated software can create vulnerabilities that are easy to
    exploit.

12. Physical Security Breaches: Unauthorized physical access to data
    centers or servers could lead to data theft or damage.

13. Zero-Day Exploits: Attackers could exploit unknown vulnerabilities
    in the system before they are discovered and patched.

14. API Vulnerabilities: If APIs are not secured properly, they could be
    exploited to gain unauthorized access or to disrupt services.

15. Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of third-party services or
    components integrated with Altinn Broker could lead to broader
    system compromise.


## Risk Analysis for Altinn Broker – before mitigation

### Risk of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and Zero-Day Exploits

Likelihood: Medium. These threats are sophisticated and may evade
standard security measures.

Impact: High. Could lead to significant data breaches or system
compromise.

Mitigation: Implement advanced threat detection systems, regular
security audits, and a rapid patch management process.

### Physical Security Breaches

Likelihood: Low to Medium, depending on physical security measures in
place.

Impact: High. Physical access could compromise the entire system.

Mitigation: Enhance physical security at data centers, implement access
controls, and surveillance systems.

### Supply Chain Attacks

Likelihood: Medium. Increasingly common in complex digital ecosystems.

Impact: High. Could compromise the integrity of the entire platform.

Mitigation: Conduct thorough security assessments of third-party vendors
and implement a robust vendor risk management program.

### Malware and Ransomware Attacks

Likelihood: Medium. Common threats across digital platforms.

Impact: High. Could lead to data loss, system downtime, and reputational
damage.

Mitigation: Employ advanced malware detection tools, regular backups,
and a comprehensive incident response plan.

### Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks

Likelihood: High. Human factors are often the weakest link in security.

Impact: Medium to High. Can lead to unauthorized access and data
breaches.

Mitigation: Conduct regular security awareness training for all users
and implement strong authentication processes.

### Insider Threats

Likelihood: Medium. Depends on employee satisfaction and monitoring
systems.

Impact: High. Insiders have access to critical systems.

Mitigation: Implement strict access controls, conduct regular audits,
and monitor user activities.

### Data Leakage through Misconfigurations

Likelihood: Medium. Misconfigurations are common in complex systems.

Impact: Medium to High. Could lead to unintentional data exposure.

Mitigation: Regularly review and audit configurations, and implement
automated configuration management tools.

### DoS/DDoS Attacks

Likelihood: Medium. Common attack vector for disrupting services.

Impact: High. Can lead to service unavailability.

Mitigation: Implement DDoS protection and mitigation strategies, and
ensure robust network security.

### Compliance with Evolving Regulations

Likelihood: High. Regulations are constantly evolving.

Impact: Medium to High. Non-compliance can lead to legal and financial
penalties.

Mitigation: Stay updated with regulatory changes and regularly review
compliance status.

### API Security Risks

Likelihood: Medium. APIs are common attack vectors.

Impact: Medium to High. Could lead to data breaches or system
compromise.

Mitigation: Regularly test API security, implement strong
authentication, and monitor API traffic.

### Data Integrity Attacks

Likelihood: Medium. Integrity attacks can be sophisticated and hard to
detect.

Impact: High. Could compromise the trustworthiness of the system.

Mitigation: Implement data integrity checks and anomaly detection
systems.

### Mobile and Remote Access Security

Likelihood: High, especially with increasing remote work trends.

Impact: Medium to High. Could lead to unauthorized access.

Mitigation: Secure mobile and remote access with VPNs, MFA, and endpoint
security.

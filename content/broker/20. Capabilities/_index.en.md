## Value streams as basis for capability definitions

The following model shows value stream stages for Altinn Broker and the main types of users. i.e. senders (data providers),  recepients (data consumers), and service owners.

Defining capabilities within value stream stages gives context to the naming and descriptions. This is considered a best practice by many enterprise architects.

## High-level user capabilities sorted om value stream stages
To see the required capabilities of the Altinn Broker solution, 
we start by considering the user requirements. 


The following model expresses user requirements  as capabilities, 
i.e. what users need to be capable of with respect to file transfers. 

_Note: This way of expressing capabilities resembles high level user stories, or epics, 
as prescribed by common frameworks for  agile development. See e.g. [the Scaled Agile Framework for Enterprises (SAFe)](https://scaledagileframework.com/)._

## High-level system capabilities sorted on value stream stages
The required system capabilities of Altinn 3 Broker must  match the needs and required capabilities of the users. 
This does not mean that the system capabilities has to match capabilities on a on-to-one basis, though this may as well be so in many cases.

The following model shows the high-level system capabilities for each value stream stage.

## Features
For further breakdown of the high-level capabilities into features, see the [Altinn Broker epics on Github](https://github.com/orgs/Altinn/projects/54/views/11).

_Note: Documentation of the breakdown into features is planned to also be included here._


## Non-functional requirements

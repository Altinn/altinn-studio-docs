Due to the different distinct roles for which an enterprise may interact with Altinn Broker, namely:

- Sender
- Receiver
- Service Owner

An enterprise may have one, or a combination of all three roles according to the context.

**Service owners** own the configuration and data storage for the Broker Service Resource, and will maintain access rights for their specific resource in Altinn Resource Rights Registry.

Most enterprises will have *Sender* and/or *Recipient*, while *Service owners* frequently will have all three.

As such, Service owners have to take additional steps when getting started to set up and define their Broker Resource.

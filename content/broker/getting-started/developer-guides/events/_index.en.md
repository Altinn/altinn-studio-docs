{{% notice warning  %}}
Currently the Events for Broker are not ready for full-scale use, due to pending changes in Altinn Events and Authorization.
This documents the expected scenario, but may be subject to change.
{{% /notice %}}

In order to use events/webhooks for a Broker resource, you need to setup a subscription for the given resource.
This subscription is used to configure the endpoint where the events published by broker end up. [You can read more about how to setup an Events subscription in Altinn Events here](/events/subscribe-to-events/developer-guides/setup-subscription/).

All Events published by Altinn Broker follow the same pattern:

```json
{
 "id": "1faa107f-3c0a-4fa6-9fce-7cee8838e258",
 "resource": "urn:altinn:resource:altinn-broker-test-resource-1",
 "resourceinstance": "da4ceacc-ad44-4e54-99b6-b58e3c13c785",
 "source": "https://platform.tt02.altinn.no/broker/api/v1/filetransfer",
 "specversion": "1.0",
 "type": "no.altinn.broker.Published",
 "subject": "/party/50015641",
 "alternativesubject": "/organisation/123456789",
 "time": "2024-04-19T07:22:19.438039Z"
}
```

## Event Subscription {#event-subcription}

This subscription is used to configure the endpoint where the events published by broker end up. [You can read more about how to setup an Events subscription in Altinn Events here](/events/subscribe-to-events/developer-guides/setup-subscription/).

You are required to set up the following filters:

- sourceFilter
  - TT02: <https://platform.tt02.altinn.no/broker/api/v1/filetransfer>
  - PROD: <https://platform.altinn.no/broker/api/v1/filetransfer>
- resourceFilter
  - "urn:altinn:resource:" + The Resource Id for the Broker Resource
- alternativesubjectfilter
  - "/organisation/(organisation number for your organisation)

*Alternativesubjectfilter* is used to restrict the event to only the authorized sender or recipient for that particular event, this ensures security and reduces visibility.

*Resourceinstance* will always be the same as the FileTransferId of the FileTransfer.

In addition you may wish to use filters for Type, so that you receive the event types you are interested in/can perform actions on.
If you do not specify a Type Filter you will receive all the different types of events if you have access to them.

**For Senders:**

- `no.altinn.broker.filetransferinitialized`
- `no.altinn.broker.uploadprocessing`
- `no.altinn.broker.uploadfailed`
- `no.altinn.broker.allconfirmeddownloaded`
- `no.altinn.broker.filepurged`

**For both Senders And Recipients:**

- `no.altinn.broker.published`
- `no.altinn.broker.downloadconfirmed`
- `no.altinn.broker.fileneverconfirmeddownloaded`

For further description of events and their usage, see [send files](../send-files/) and [receive files](../receive-files/) developer guides, as these describe the events in relation to the respective roles/process.

## Solution overview – Data at Rest

TBD, Erik:

- Refer to a preceding section with a suitable diagram showing Broker
  Metadata Storage and Broker File Storage (or present a more
  fit-for-the-purpose model her).

- Define data models for Broker Metadata Storage and Broker File
  Storage; in order to document that we do not expose “sensitive” data.

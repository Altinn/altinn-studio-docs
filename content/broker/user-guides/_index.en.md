In Altinn Broker we have 3 distinct roles for which an enterprise may interact with Altinn Broker.
An enterprise may have one, or a combination of all three roles according to the context and need.

Service owners will own the configuration and data storage for the Broker Service Resource, and will maintain access rights for their specific resource in Altinn Resource Rights Registry.
Most enterprises will have one or two roles, while Service owners frequently will have all three.

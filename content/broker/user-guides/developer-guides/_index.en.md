Since Altinn Broker is open source, you can access our code in [our public github repo](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-broker) and build a local docker instance to test against.

We also welcome contributions to the solution.

See the [readme file at github](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-broker/blob/main/README.md) for an introduction to Altinn 3 Broker, and how to build and run it in your dev environment.

The Repo also contains a [PostMan collection](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-broker/blob/main/altinn3-broker-postman-collection.json) with examples.

Swagger for the File Transfer API is hosted [here](/api/broker/spec/).

## Overall API operation

To understand how the Broker API operates, including its dependencies and configuration steps, refer to the information below:

TODO: Replace with sequence diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant TE as TE/You
    participant Maskinporten as Maskinporten
    participant ResourceRegistry as Resource Registry
    participant Events as Events
    participant SBS as SBS/client
    participant Broker as Broker
    participant Authorization as Authorization

    TE->>+Maskinporten: 1. Register clients
    TE->>+ResourceRegistry: 2. Register resource with auth policy
    TE->>+Events: 3. Set up event subscription
    TE->>+SBS: Configure SBS/client
    loop Each Broker request
        SBS->>+Authorization: Get token (note: usually cached)
        SBS->>+Broker: Initialize FileTransfer etc.
        Broker->>+Authorization: Authorize request
        Authorization->>+ResourceRegistry: Retrieve policy
        Broker->>+Events: Publish event
        Events->>-SBS: Push event/webhook
    end
```

You need to have performed the steps in [Get started](../get-started/) to setup the Access requirements.

## Overall process

Overall process flow reflect the implemented reality of the [file transfer process](../../basic-concepts/#file-transfer-process-states)

All operations are asynchronous, unless otherwise noted.
As such, you should implement Event subscriptions to make your process optimized instead of relying on polling for status.

## Authentication

For all operations you will need to Authenticate using your Maskinporten Client then acquire an Altinn Token from [Altinn Authentication](https://docs.altinn.studio/authentication/architecture/accesstoken/).

{{% notice warning  %}}
SUBJECT TO CHANGE
Use the Altinn Token as a Bearer token for all Broker API requests along with the APIM subscription key as a header with the key `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`.

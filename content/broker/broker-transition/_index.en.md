## About
For broker service owners whose end users are reliant on using Altinn 2, but who wish to migrate their broker service to Altinn 3, Altinn is offering a Transition service.
This enables communication between senders and receivers of files regardless of which Altinn Broker service they are integrated to.

This service will allow service owners to link an existing Altinn 2 service to an Altinn 3 resource, and to forward Altinn 2 Broker Service requests to the Altinn 3 Broker Service app while not substantially changing the Altinn 2 Broker Service End User experience.
This will then allow end users of the Altinn 2 service to communicate with end users of the Altinn 3 resource. 

For Altinn 3 users, the user experience will not be different than if all users are using Altinn 3. 

Altinn 2 users will experience some minor differences related to file transfer and returned values compared to if all users are using Altinn 2.

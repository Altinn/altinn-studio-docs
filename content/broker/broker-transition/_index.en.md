## About
For broker service owners whose end users are reliant on using Altinn 2, but who wish to migrate their broker service to Altinn 3, Altinn is offering a Transition service.

This service will allow service owners to link an existing Altinn 2 service to an Altinn 3 resource, and to forward Altinn 2 Broker Service requests to the Altinn 3 Broker Service app while not substantially changing the Altinn 2 Broker Service End User experience.

## Introduction

Two migration strategies are supported for migration of Altinn Broker
services:

- Alt. A: Hard shift. All users and End User Systems make a coordinated
  shift to Altinn 3. This option is recommended in cases where such a
  coordinated shift is feasible. No transition solution is needed and
  alle features of Altinn 3 may be used as soon as the shift has been
  made.

- Alt. B: Soft shift. Users and End User Systems shift to Altinn 3 on an
  individual basis, when ready. A transition solution is needed to
  bridge between Altinn 2 and Altinn 3………..

## Alt. A: Hard shift from Altinn 2 to Altinn 3 for all users of a service

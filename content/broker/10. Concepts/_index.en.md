## Context overview

The following diagram gives a high level overview of Altinn 3 Broker actors, services and information flow.

[{{< figure src="./image2.png" title="Figure: Altinn Broker Context Diagram" alt="Alt-text">}}](https://altinn.github.io/ark/models/archi-all/?view=id-5824a04f89d04341aba661be649270b4)

Explanation to the diagram:

* The main service provided by Altinn Broker is managed file transfer from one sender (provider) to one or more recepients (consumers) with intermediary storage of files and metadata.
* File Upload and File Download services are configurable.
* All features are accessible to End User Systems via APIs.
* Human End Users communicate with Altinn Broker via GUIs provided by either their custom End User Systems or GUI-s provided ny Altinn Broker. Note: Service owners may choose to leverage Altinn Studio for building GUIs.
* End User Systems may be triggered by events via notifications to [Webhooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook). The same events may alternatively be detected by polling the APIs, 
  however supporting Webhooks in the End User Systems is recommended over API polling.
* Service Owners configure the services and receive usage reports, invoices and other information according to the agreed service levels.
* Data Providers upload files and receive status updates.
* Data Consumers receive notifications about available files and download files, and they give status information about download processes (confirming successful download being the regular case).

## Conceptual information model

A high level conceptual information model for Altinn 3 Broker is shown in the below figure. This model is used as basis for the more detailed imformation model of Altinn Broker _Metadata Storage_.

{{< figure src="./Altinn 3 Broker Metadata - basic, conceptual.png" title="Figure: Conceptual information model" alt="Alt-text">}}

Explanation:

* The overall File Transfer Process includes exactly one Upload Process by a Sender and one or more Download Processes corresponding to the number of Recipients.
* Each File Transfer Process considers one File only. The same applies for each Upload Process and Download Process. 
* The same File may be used in several File Transfer Processes and consequently in several Download Processes.
* Only one Upload Process per File is considered. Note that if the same file is uploaded more than once, Altinn Broker will  consider the files as different and assign different identifiers.
* Notifications about File Transfer Events are given to Senders and Recepients depending on subscription setup. E.g. recepients may be notified about new messages, and senders may be notified about delivery events. 
* Each File Transfer Event relates to one File Transfer Process, and consequently only one File, however any number of events may occur for the same File Transfer Process.

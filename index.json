For Altinn.Apps frontend, these files are hosted on a CDN, and loaded in at runtime. All of the frontend apps are set up with the same overall React + Redux architecture:\nComponent: The react component Props: Define how the component should render Store: Contains all global state data used by the components Action: Triggered when a component updates Reducer: Listens to actions and updates the store according to which action is triggered Redux-Saga: Middleware. Intercepts the action before it reaches the reducer, in order to process data before it goes to the store. Useful for handling async operations like calling APIs.

	"content": "Consider What are the current challenges? Start by defining the problem. What are you going to solve? It is easier to create a solution with a clearly defined scope for your problem. It might be a good idea to gather your project group, and to look for a nice wall to put post-it notes on. Who are the users and what are their needs? We recommend starting by defining your target audience and their requirements as early as possible during the project. Create an overview of your users and who they are. In most cases your service should be usable by multiple user groups. Are they citizens or do they represent a company? What background do they have? Are they digitally inclined or not accustomed to digital services? This phase normally starts with interviews, observations or a focus group. Points of contact for the user Create an overview of the points of contact for the user. What does the customer see during their use of your service? One way to do this is pictured below: Should Altinn be hidden from the end user or will you be using Altinns internal UI? Does this match how the user expects to complete their task? Is it possible to offer the customer the relevant part of Altinn in the context they are in, instead of sending them back and forth? What data do you need? The need for a digital solution usually starts with a need to gather data. Start by checking if someone else has the data you need, and if it is available for reuse. You can check for data in our common datacatalog. If not - how can you request it in a way that requires the least effort by your users? Sometimes it could be an idea to try something different than than obvious solutions where you ask through a form. After working through the initial phase and defining the user requirements, we recommend that you set up a prototype that can be tested by relevant users. If you are creating a form, you can use our prototype-Kit for Figma.\n"

Components are based on Material UI components.\nThe diagram below show the architecture:\nStore A store holds the whole state tree of your application. The only way to change the state inside it is to dispatch an action on it.\nRead more.\nReducers Reducers specify how the application\u0026rsquo;s state changes in response to actions sent to the store. Remember that actions only describe what happened, but don\u0026rsquo;t describe how the application\u0026rsquo;s state changes.\nRead more.\nMiddleware redux-saga is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.\nRead more.\nBest practices We try to follow some best-practices for React architecture:\nSmall, function-specific components\nUI components are \u0026ldquo;dumb\u0026rdquo;, this keeps the amount of logic to a minimum within the components. Reusability\nUI components are shared across apps. Shared components between app frontend and receipt frontend . Use Material UI components as much as possible instead of building our own components from scratch. DRY code\nUse shared resources across features to avoid duplication of code. Share resources/utils between app frontend and receipt frontend. Comments only where necessary\nFunction and component names should be self-explanatory. Avoid clutter and having to update comments when things change. Component names in capital\nKeep complex data-loading logic separate from rendering of components\nState is handled by redux as much as possible Data should be passed as props to UI components where possible Use a feature-based code structure\nCode related to a feature should be grouped together, rather than grouping code by function (actions/reducers etc). Follow linting rules\nUse a code analyzer to make sure linting rules are followed, for clean readable code "

Setup must be done manually for now.\rTo set up file uploading components in repeating groups, some additional setup is required.\nWhen uploading file attachments it may be difficult to distinguish which file attachments belongs to which rows in the repeating group, and thus which submitted information belongs to each attachment. Therefore, you must set up connections to the data model when file uploading are used in repeating groups, so that Altinn can fill out the unique identificator that belongs to each file attachment and send this together with the rest of the data in the instance.\nThe ability to place a reference to the file attachment in the data model can also be used outside of repeating groups if you want a reference to a file attachment together with the form data on the receivers end.\nThe following is an example of a data model expecting a reference to an uploaded file attachment.\n\u0026lt;xsd:schema xmlns:xsd=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\u0026#34; elementFormDefault=\u0026#34;qualified\u0026#34; attributeFormDefault=\u0026#34;unqualified\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:element name=\u0026#34;FamilieMedlemmer\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;Skjema\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:complexType name=\u0026#34;Skjema\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:element name=\u0026#34;FamilyMember\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;FamilyMember\u0026#34; maxOccurs=\u0026#34;99\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:anyAttribute /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:complexType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:complexType name=\u0026#34;FamilyMember\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:element name=\u0026#34;FirstName\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xsd:string\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:element name=\u0026#34;Picture\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xsd:string\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:complexType\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:schema\u0026gt; This is connected to the file upload component in the group:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;picture\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;FileUpload\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Picture\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;FamilyMember.Picture\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;maxFileSizeInMB\u0026#34;: 25, \u0026#34;maxNumberOfAttachments\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minNumberOfAttachments\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;displayMode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;simple\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true } In cases where it is allowed to upload multiple files to the same file attachment component, use a data model attachment of the type list:\n\u0026lt;xsd:complexType name=\u0026#34;FamilyMember\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:element name=\u0026#34;FirstName\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xsd:string\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xsd:element name=\u0026#34;Pictures\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xsd:string\u0026#34; maxOccurs=\u0026#34;5\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xsd:complexType\u0026gt; { [...] \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;list\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;FamilyMember.Pictures\u0026#34; } } The receiving end will then receive a list of multiple unique ID\u0026rsquo;s, one for each attachment. The same unique ID will also be displayed in the PDF receipt - but it is recommended to hide this, as attachments are shown seperately on the receipt page and the unique ID can become confusing to the users.\n"

Once a user/party is validated, the backend API to create an instance is called, and the user is sent to the first process step defined for the app.\nForm This feature is responsible for the data process task type, which is typically used for form filling. This includes rendering the form UI designed in Altinn Studio, running any rules/dynamics, calling APIs to perform calculations, validations, save form data, submit/move process to next step.\nTo render the form UI, the form layout defined in Altinn Studio is used together with metadata about the data model.

The save button is hidden. \u0026ldquo;likert\u0026rdquo; Likert display. filter Support to filter elements in group, so that only the elements matching the defined criteria are displayed. E.g. in a group displaying work experience, only display the elements where the workplace was Oslo. List of criteria is based on values of one or more fields in the group, on the format:\n\u0026#34;edit\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;filter\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;felt i datamodell\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;ønsket verdi\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } ] } If there are multiple criteria, all must match for the element to be displayed.\nIf there is only one result, this is displayed automatically in editing-mode. If there are multiple elements in the group that match the filter, these will be displayed. Other elements in the group will be hidden. filter can be combined with the mode-parameter.\nIf you combine `\"mode\": \"showAll\"` with `\"filter\"`, it will not be possible to add more elements to the group. This is because with \"showAll\" only the editing area is displayed, and as long as the filter does not match, the element will not be displayed.\raddButton Determines whether the \u0026ldquo;Add new\u0026rdquo; button is displayed below the table. It is useful to hide this if you only wish to display data.\nsaveButton Determines whether the \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button is displayed when a group element is in editing mode. The default behaviour if the parameter is not set is for the \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button to be displayed. If you have set \u0026quot;mode\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;showAll\u0026quot;, the \u0026ldquo;Save\u0026rdquo; button is always hidden, since in this mode you do not have the opportunity to close the editing area for the group-element. The data is still saved.\ndeleteButton Determines whether the \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; button is displayed when a group element is in editing mode. The default behaviour if the parameter is not set is for the \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; button to be displayed.\nmultiPage Editing/filling out pages can be performed over multiple \u0026ldquo;pages\u0026rdquo;/displays. Requires more setup to work, see below for more information.\nopenByDefault If there are no elements in the group already, the group should be opened in editing mode. Note that this cannot be used with \u0026quot;mode\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;showAll\u0026quot;.\nExample:\n{ ... \u0026#34;edit\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;openByDefault\u0026#34;: true } } Display group as part of Panel A new parameter, panel, has been added which can be set up on a group component. This says that the group should be displayed as part of the Panel component.\nHere, you will recognize the appearance and settings that can be set on the panel component. Example configuration:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-panel-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;panel-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;panel-2\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dette er bare en demo av input panel utenfor repeterende gruppe.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;body\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Her ser jeg bare at ting fungerer som forventet.\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;panel\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;variant\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;info\u0026#34; } }, Here the group has been set up to be displayed as a panel with the variant \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo;. The setup is otherwise exactely the same as a regular group.\nThis will give the following output:\nIt is possible to configure the following settings in the panel field of a group:\nParameter Required Description variant Yes Which variant of panel the group should be placed in. Available values are \u0026ldquo;info\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;success\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;warning\u0026rdquo; iconUrl No If you want your own icon as part of a panel, this can be set. Relative or full path, e.g. \u0026ldquo;awesomeIcon.png\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;http://cdn.example.com/awesomeIcon.png\u0026quot; iconAlt No Alternate text for the custom icon. Can only be set if iconUrl has been set. Can be plain text or a reference to a text resource. groupReference No Reference to a different group. Can be used if you wish to add elements to a repeating group from some other context. Read more. Example:\n\u0026#34;panel\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;variant\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;info\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;iconUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;kort.svg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;iconAlt\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Betalingskort ikon\u0026#34; } Add element from separate repeating group A use case one can imagine is that the user is asked to choose from an already filled out repeating group. One possible case is that the user is registering a set of suspicious transactions. Here, the user first enters a set of separate payment cards as a repeating group. Later on in the form, the user will choose elements from this group when adding a suspicious transaction. While filling out the suspicious transaction, the user remembers that they forgot to add a payment card, but do not wish to navigate all the way back to the original payment card group.\nThis is where the groupReference parameter comes in handy. This will open up for the possibility to add an element to a repeating group from the context from which you are using this list.\nA picture to illustrate the usecase:\nIn this fictitious case the groups are placed directly above each other, but imagine that these are filled out on different pages in the form. To achieve this setup, a group of elements are added to the repeating group that is set up with transactions (group-2) with a reference to the first group with payment cards (group-1). The following group component is one of the children of group-2:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-panel-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Legg til nytt betalingskort\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;body\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Kortet du registrer vil bli lagret og tilgjengelig i resten av tjenesten.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;add_label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Legg til nytt betalingskort\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;panel\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;showIcon\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;iconUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;kort.svg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variant\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;success\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;groupReference\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;first-group\u0026#34; } } }, The text resources that can be set are:\ntitle - panel title body - panel body. Placed above the group elements. add_label - text for the \u0026ldquo;add new\u0026rdquo;-button. If children is not set on the group, the children of the referenced group will be rendered. By adding to children you can freely define that only a subset of all children of the referenced group should be displayed.\nDemonstration:\nSee example app for complete setup in form layout.\nMultiple pages within group-display This functionality is as of today only available for repeating groups. Displayment of groups over multiple pages inside the editing area of the group is only supported for groups at the top level, and is not supported\rfor nested groups. When entering data in a group, there may be incidents where each element in the group contains multiple fields, which may result in a lot of scrolling and confusion for the user. To solve this, there has been implemented a possibility to split the fillout over multiple pages, which the user can navigate through while filling out the group element. The navigation takes place within a layout, and updates only the display within the editing area of the group.\nTo make use of this functionality, you will have to prefix the components in the children list with a number indicating which \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; of the fillout the component should be displayed on, followed by :. We start the count on 0, that is to say components to be displayed on the first \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; must be prefixed with 0:. Components to be displayed on the second page must be prefixed with 1:, and so on. In addition, you must set \u0026quot;multiPage\u0026quot;: true on the new edit-parameter (see above). See example below:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Some-group-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;0:fnr\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1:fornavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1:mellomnavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;1:etternavn\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 10, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;familie.barn\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;edit\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;multiPage\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;mode\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;hideTable\u0026#34;, } } Here a mode that hides the table when editing has also been added. The result will be as displayed below.\n![Fill-out of group over multiple \u0026ldquo;pages\u0026rdquo;](group-multipage.gif \u0026ldquo;Fill-out of group over multiple \u0026ldquo;pages\u0026rdquo;)\n"

The principles are document as suggested by TOGAF.\nThe architecture principles below is described like TOGAF recommends.\nFree and open-source software Principle\nThe components and solutions in Altinn 3 are Free and Open Source.\nRationale\nPossibility to share the platform as Open Source. The possibility to create an Open Source community around the platform.\nImplications\nCode developed is shared on GitHub. See License. We also have our backlog on GitHub. Can\u0026rsquo;t use closed source products in the platform Can\u0026rsquo;t use products with licensing limiting use and modifications Others can easily reuse, modify and improve our components and solutions Web Standards Principle\nUse Web Standards.\nRationale\nCan use standard tools and developers does not need to have special skills to develop components in the platform or applications to run on the platform.\nImplications\nFormats and frameworks used need to follow standards We use JWT in authentication cookies Build with modern and popular frameworks Principle\nWhen choosing between different technology with similar capabilites, select the most modern and popular framework.\nRationale\nThe project is open source and it is a big advantage to build the solution on open source technology that developers love to use. This gives better access to resources with the needed competency.\nImplications\nWe build the frontend using React and ASP.NET Core, the 2 most loved web frameworks. We use .NET Core, the framework that developers love the most We use Linux and Docker containers in Kubernetes, the 3 most loved platforms. We use Visual Studio Code, the most loved development environment. Favor standards over custom Principle\nWhenever we need to store information we favor standard formats for that information over creating a custom format.\nRationale\nStandard formats are documented and is some cases it exists 3. party tools to edit information.\nImplications\nWe use BPMN 2.0 to define the process for applications We use XACML 3.0 to define authorization policies for applications We use JSON as general format. Isolation Principle We should try isolate application and data own by one organization from others.\nRationale\nReduce risk for one organization affecting service for another organization.\nImplications\nSeperate Kubernetes Clusters for each organization Seperate data store for each organization Design and build for Public Cloud Principle\nThe solutions should be deployed to a public cloud solution. The architecture need to support that.\nRationale\nUsing public cloud infrastructure from one of the big vendors gives cost savings, the team can be more agile and the solutions can take scale.\nImplications\nAdditional security measures Need to build knowledge about cloud solutions Limit cloud lock-in Principle\nThe architecture should try to avoid technology that locks the platform to a specific public cloud vendor. But not for all costs. In many cases it would still make sense to choose a managed service only available in a given public cloud.\nRationale\nThe goal with this principle is that it should be possible to move the solution to a different cloud provider without needing to build everything from scratch.\nImplications\nDocker and Kubernetes is used for containers and orhecstration of containers. We use document databases and BLOBS for storing data. Everything talks through APIs. Build as microservices Principle\nThe platform is built as microservices. Related functionality is grouped in to seperate applications and deployed as containers. Apps created in Altinn Studio will be deployed as microservices/apps.\nRationale\nThe different components can be scaled differently, it can be deployed independently. Reduced deploy time. Different teams can be responsible for different microservices/apps.\nImplications\nFunctionality in Altinn Platform is seperated in Authentication, Authorization, Profile, Storage, Pdf and Register components Applications created in Altinn Studio is deployed as microapps to Altinn Apps Design for automation Principle\nThe component should be created in a way that they support automation in development, deployment and operations.\nRationale\nReduce the required effort to develop and operate the platform.\nImplications\nWe use Continuous integration We use Continuous deployment We build Infrastructure as code We use Automatic scaling We monitor and do automatic recovery of components Favor managed services Principle\nWe should use manages cloud services when possible.\nRationale\nReduce effort needed to host and scale the platform.\nImplications\nUse managed PostgreSQL in Azure for Gitea Use managed CosmosDB as document database Use Azure blob storage for storing data Use Azure Kubernets Services to manage the Kubernetes Clusters Use Azure Api Management as API-management platform Security in depth Principle\nAll components should authenticate and authorize requests.\nRationale\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t trust other components.\nImplications\nComponents in Altinn Platform authenticates and authorize end user even if the request comes throug a application that also require the same We use API management to control traffic between Altinn Apps and Altinn Platform. Cross-platform Principle\nThe components in the platform should be cross platform and can run on Microsoft Windows, Linux and MacOs.\nRationale\nDevelopers should be able to create applications on any platform, and our platform should never be locked to a single operating system or processor-architecture.\nImplications\nWe use .NET Core or Java to build components. Container technology Principle\nApplications should be deployed as containers.\nRationale\nThe rationale to use containers is that we get a consistent runtime environment that can run anywhere. Isolate runtime environment. Consistency.\nImplications\nDeploy and run applications/components in docker containers. "

Independent Deployment: Simple services are easier to deploy, and since they are autonomous, are less likely to cause system failures when they go wrong. Technology Diversity: With microservices you can mix multiple languages, development frameworks and data-storage technologies. Risk \u0026amp; Issues Distribution: Distributed systems are harder to program, since remote calls are slow and are always at risk of failure. Eventual Consistency: Maintaining strong consistency is extremely difficult for a distributed system, which means everyone has to manage eventual consistency. Operational Complexity: You need a mature operations team to manage lots of services, which are being redeployed regularly. Layered Pattern Overview Applications/Components are organized into horizontal layers, each layer performing a specific role within the application. Typical the layers will typical be Presentation, API, Business and dataacess where dataccess could be access to database or API calls to other components.\nBenefits Testability. Dependency injection. Possible to mock lower layers. "

Allowing\nchanges to the design and colour would hurt the consistancy between services. Common designs between service owners is something that we should strive for. To achieve a common framework, cooperation between Altinn employees and service owners is required.\nWe wish for a good common solution that can be used and improved by all, instead of a variety of different solutions through unique CSS-changes. This will also simplify following accessability requirements accross apps on our platform. You will be required and resposnible in following all WCAG-demands, should you choose to walk away from our design.\nDo you need a new component?\nWe want everyone who is working on developing apps to contribute to our library of components with both design and code.

	"content": "The user should not need an error message to understand what is required to fill out the application correctly. It should be obvious in the informative text at the start of the form and in the labels for each input field.\nYou should usually only ask about information that is strictly required to complete the task of the form. With this in mind, you should inform the user of which fields are mandatory and which are not. One suggested way to do this is to write (voluntary) in either the title or in an explanation of the input field.\nDivide the content into multiple steps and use paths One long page with too much information and multiple tasks can quickly overwhelm a user. Try to divide your service up into pages in a way where the user only has one task per page. This can for example be a question that the user has to answer or important information that the user must be aware of. This simplifies the process for the user by only giving them one thing to focus on and understand at a time.\nThe design we are currently offering has been created with this concept in mind. Altinn 2 style sheets can also be created within the Altinn 3 platform, but larger amounts of total components can lead to large amounts of scrolling and a more confusing experience for the user, and short pages with less content help remedy this confusion. Example: starting a sole proprietorship.\nThe user should not be required to give more information than necessary. If the user has answered a question that leads to another, you can decide to hide or show the question (or page) depending on their answer with dynamic branching.\nDisabled By showing fields as disabled you might expect that users know why they can\u0026rsquo;t use the element, but this is not always the case. Some users do not understand that a field is deactivated, which can lead to further confusion. Because of this we recommend limiting your use of disabling elements, and possibly including a text to explain why it is disabled, should you choose to use this feature.\n"

Autentisering skjer med Maskinporten og du laster ned data ved pull fra database, og laster opp data direkte mot API i den enkelte applikasjon. Vår referanseapplikasjon Altinn CLI ​viser disse mønstrene og kan brukes for å komme i gang. Utvikle tjenestene\nAltinn Studio brukes til å opprette applikasjoner (apps). En app kan være alt fra enkle skjemaer til større avanserte applikasjoner som digitaliserer komplekse prosesser. Det er viktig å tenke på at brukeren skal oppleve prosessene som sammenhengende og oversiktlige. Prosessene kan startes av det offentlige eller av brukeren selv, eller automatisk som en reaksjon på en hendelse. Teste tjenestene\nAltinn har et eget testmiljø hvor du kan teste om apper og opp-/nedlasting av data virker som det skal. I testmiljøet bruker du fiktive testpersoner og organisasjoner. Når du har kommet så langt i utviklingen er det også viktig å brukerteste den endelige løsningen på reelle folk i målgruppen. Dette for å sikre at det ikke er noen hinder for de som skal bruke tjenestene. Det er også mulig å teste app lokalt på egen maskin.

	"description": "How to set up navigation between pages.",
	"content": "Navigation to the next page happens via a navigation button. This button has to be added manually in every layout file where you want to be able to navigate forward. Navigating back is done via a back arrow in the top left corner. This button will always be shown if there is something to navigate backwards to, and is not part of the layout file. See image below.\nAdd button for navigation Button for navigation is added to all layout files where it is needed. If you want the button to appear at the bottom of the page, it has to be added at the bottom in the layout file. Configuration example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nav-page2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationButtons\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;next\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;next\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;back\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;back\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {} } It is also possible to show a back button together with the next button by adding the parameter showBackButton: true in the button configuration.\nParameter Description id Unique ID, the same as for all schema components. type Has to be \u0026quot;NavigationButtons\u0026quot; textResourceBindings By setting the parameters next (and back), you are able to override the default texts to be shown on the buttons. showBackButton Optional. Makes two buttons (back/next) appear instead of just one (next). Navigation Bar The Navigation Bar gives easy access to all pages in an application.\nThe Navigaion Bar lists all pages in the application, and is not suited for use with the tracks feature.\rOn big screens, all pages will be visible. If there is not enough space on one line, the list will break and the rest of the pages will go on the next line. On smaller screens, all pages will be hidden in a menu. The current page is shown in the menu, and when the menu is clicked, all pages will show.\nThe Navigation Bar is added to all layout files. Configuration example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;navbar-page-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationBar\u0026#34; } Change texts on navigationbar buttons The text in the navigation bar buttons will by default use the filename of the page without the extension. F.ex if you have page1.json and page2.json, the buttons will contain page1 and page2. To override these texts, you can add texts in the resources.XX.json, where the id is the filename without extension. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;page1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;First page\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;page2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Last page\u0026#34; }, Order Default order for the pages is alphabetically. Besides this you can name each page as you wish, and the filename is what will be used. To ensure the pages appear in a specific order, you could prefix them with numbers, f.ex:\n|- App/\r|- ui/\r|- layouts/\r|- 1.firstPage.json\r|- 2.secondPage.json\r|- 3.aFinalPage.json It is also possible to override the order on the pages in the Settings.json file found under App/ui/, by setting the pages.order property. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;side2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;side1\u0026#34;] } } Functionality for dynamically deciding which page should be next is not something that is currently supported.\rValidation on page navigation It is possible to trigger validation when the user tries to navigate to a different page. This can be done by adding the string validatePage to the triggers in the navigation button component. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;7cbc1c00-4c8c-42b6-bcef-12b3c4c45373\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationButtons\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationButtons\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;next\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Neste\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;back\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Tilbake\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;validatePage\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;showBackButton\u0026#34;: true } If there are errors on the page, the user will be prevented from moving forward until this is fixed. If validatePage is added as a trigger, the ID of the element that triggers the validation will be sent as a header LayoutId to the backend. This makes it possible to customize the backend validtaions based on which page the user triggers the validation from. It is also possible to trigger validation on all pages by adding validateAllPages in triggers.\n"

	"description": "It is always a good idea to do user testing in multiple stages of a project. Through user testing you measure if your solution corresponds to the needs of the users. Doing this early in the project is a good investment, since you save time and money by avoiding developing a solution that doesn&#39;t match what it was trying to solve.",
	"content": "User testing does not have to be advanced with setup, or the amount of test subjects in mind. A rule of thumb is that if you have tested a system on 5 people you\u0026rsquo;ve discovered 80% of the usability flaws (Jacob Nielsen).\nYou will have to adjust your form after the usability testing. It could be bigger things, like navigation or flow, but also smaller adjustments like language or alterations within the interaction-design. If larger changes are required it might be a good idea to do another user test to check if the new changes have had the desired effect.\nA sign that you have succesfully created a solution that fits the users requirements is if most of the users in your useability test are able to complete their task without your help, and within a reasonable timeframe.\nUseablility testing in Figma Have you set up a prototype in Figma by using our Prototype-Kit? Great! You can now use this for useability testing!\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve added multiple steps in your form, you have to remember to link between these steps. You can do this by choosing \u0026ldquo;Prototype\u0026rdquo; in the right-upper corner in Figma. Select a frame or a button and notice the little white dot that shows up to the right of the item you selected. This dot can be grabbed and pulled over to the frame you wish the button to lead to.\nThere is a flow for every starting alternative, along with a flow for the mobile sketches. Press the play button on the prototype you want to try out. After it has started you can switch between the different flows in the left margin.\nYou can share the files with the testers if you click the \u0026ldquo;share\u0026rdquo; button in the top right of the window. you can either choose that the file should be open to anyone who opens the link, or that only people that are invited (via email) should have access.\nGood advice for user testing Test early with real users The user friendliness can only be measured if it is tested on the solutions target userbase. testing early is cheaper than fixing eventual problems that are uncovered during production. Render the test harmless Explain to the test subject that the purpose of the test isn\u0026rsquo;t to test them, but to discover eventual mistakes or faults in the service so that it can be fixed or improved. Ask the test subject to think out loud. For some, thinking out loud will come naturally while others might need a reminder every once in a while. Don\u0026rsquo;t ask leading questions, show that you want to hear the test subjects thoughts and their feedback. Listen Remember to give the test subject room for thought, and keep in mind that you should focus on listening. Give the test more than enough time to avoid a stressed environment. Remind yourself of the purpose of the test Feedback from the test subject can easily be interpreted as a critique of your own work, remind yourself that you want the best result as possible for the quality of your service. Creating tasks for the test Spend plenty of time formulating the tasks for your user test, doing a pilot-test ahead of the real one will let you discover errors with the actual test.\nSet a clear goal for what the participant is trying to achieve choose tasks that are relevante and credible Don\u0026rsquo;t give away the answer or give to many hints You can find more tips on how to complete the test in the best way possible on the site gov.uk\nAfter the test You have likely found some things that you should improve after you have completed a couple of usability tests. After any changes to the form layout or flow of your form you should consider doing another round of usability testing.\nYou will soon be ready for developing! Remember to see our guidelines for design and content within the forms\n"

It also uses the subapps ux-editor and schema-editor to provide functionality for creating/editing forms and data models. It does not have access to the store of any of the subapps.\nHeader and Navigation Material UI (applicatiopn bar and drawer) components are customized with altinn studio styles for the header and navigation in Altinn Studio. A third-party library, React Routing, is used together with Material UI to handle navigation. When the user clicks on a header/side navigation link, the route changes and the subapp specific to the route is rendered.\nHeader Menu (Application bar) Application bar component is the Altinn Studio\u0026rsquo;s header menu(navigation links at the top). React router library is used to handle those navigations. Header menu has different user interface on desktop and tablet. The display text and the links for navigation are built as object in a configuration file appbarconfig.\nThe configuration object in the file is iterated and the application bar is rendered. The styles specific to the component are placed inside the component file. In addition to the navigation menu, a breadcrumb is also rendered in tablet view.\nSide Menu (Drawer Menu) Drawer menu component is the Altinn Studio\u0026rsquo;s side menu which can be found on the left. It displays a list of Icons by default and on hover expands the menu and lists text by the side of the icon. It will render a list of navigation links based on the selected header menu.\nSide menu has different user interfaces in desktop and tablet. In tablet, only text is displayed and it slides in from left when \u0026ldquo;Menu\u0026rdquo; button is clicked.\nTwo different components are created to acheive this:\nLeftDrawerMenu TabletDrawerMenu The styles specific to the side menu is added in a separate style file. Similar to the header menu, the side menu is also rendered by looping over the menu settings object which is available in a separate configuration file\nux-editor This application is responsible for the GUI allowing app developers to create/edit form views that will be shown in the data step in the app frontend.\nThe general concept is that there is one or more JSON files (layouts) where the components that are to be part of a form are specified. This includes the component types, texts, order, etc. These files are then parsed to display the form in the app frontend.\nThe ux-editor application provides a GUI to create/change these files. The ux-editor displays a simple representation of the components that app developers can then edit.\nschema-editor This application is currently under development.\rResponsible for the GUI allowing app developers to upload/create/edit data models for the application.\n"

Below you can see a simplified overview of the layers of components that are used to render the form, including some of the most important inputs.\nA detailed overview of the app frontend structure and architecture is available here.\nForm components All form components should be presentational components. This means that their only responsibility is to present something to the DOM, and as such they do not handle any direct interactions with the redux store. This is the responsibility of the parent component (in most cases GenericComponent), which will provide the form components with the data they need to render themselves, as well as any functions to call in the event of a change.\nAdding a new form component Form components are defined in src/components. Find a relevant folder in the structure, or create a new one if necessary, and implement the component there. All form components are react components, that are provided with props as input. A list of the props that are provided and can be used:\nprop name type description source id string unique component ID layout text string text to be displayed layout (textResourceBindings.title value) formData any form data to display (if relevant) parent component language any object containing standard language resources parent component shouldFocus boolean should component have focus parentComponent handleDataChange (value: any) =\u0026gt; void function to call in the event of a data change parent component handleFocusUpdate (value: any) =\u0026gt; void function to handle updating focus parent component getTextResource (key: string) =\u0026gt; string function to get text resource value parent component isValid boolean is component valid parent component In addition, any properties defined on the component in the layout-file will be passed through to the component.\nTo make a new form component available for use, it needs to be added to the module that exports all the form components for use elsewhere in the application. This is the src/components/index.tsx-file. In this file, you will find lists of all the available form components exported. To make your component available, you need to do the following:\nImport your new component into the file Update the ComponentTypes enum with your new component type Add your a new object for your component to one of the component lists (or create a new list if relevant). The list object must have the following structure: {\rname: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;component name\u0026gt;\u0026#34;,\rTag: \u0026lt;Component tag\u0026gt;,\rType: \u0026lt;ComponenType enum for your component\u0026gt;m\rcustomProperties: {\r\u0026lt;any custom properties that the component should be initialized with\u0026gt;\r}\r} Use the existing lists and components as an example for setting this up. Once this is done, the component is ready to use, and can be added to the layout file of an app and used.\n"

	"description": "Description of the Altinn 3 APIs for end users and application owners.",
	"content": "The APIs The new solution will have multiple APIs, but they can be divided in two groups. The app APIs and the Platform APIs.\nApp API The application API is an API that provides access to specific instances of a specific app. The API provides features for working with data elements while keeping the metadata document for the instance and its data elements updated. The instance level endpoints revolves around moving an instance through its defined process and controlling some instance level settings.\nMetadata for an app is the second job of the app API. There are endpoint that give access to the metadata of the app itself, its data types and process description.\nEvery app will expose almost identical endpoints and functionality. External parties should need only one client implementation across all app APIs. Technically there is nothing preventing an application owner from adding or making changes to the API, but in those cases it is probably an application with a different process flow. In these cases, the application might require some special handling, and additional documentation should be provided by the application owner.\nhttps://{org}.apps.altinn.no/{org}/{appname} The URL identifies the application owner specific hostname using the short name org, and the identificator of the app consisting of both the application owner short name and the name of the app org/appname.\nPlatform API The Platform APIs are primarily made to support the applications hosted on the platform, but a lot of endpoints can be used directly by both application owners and users. Primarily on the Authentication, Events and Storage APIs.\nThe Storage API provides access to all instances across all applications. It can be used to access metadata about applications, instances, data elements and instance activitylog (events), as well as the actual data content. This API should be the preferred method for application owners to download data associated with instances created based on their applications. Application users can use it if they need a form of message box or want to retrieve archived instances and their data.\nThe Authentication API provides methods for authentication.\nThe Events API provides access to the Events component endpoint for listing events. This can be used sporadically to query Altinn for events that have occured in the solution.\nhttps://platform.altinn.no API user groups There are primarily two groups of users of the Altinn APIs. The first group consists of applications and systems used by the owners of the Apps hosted by Altinn. This group is called Application Owners. The second group consists of organisations and people using the Apps to communicate with the application owners. This group is called Application Users.\nThe two groups have many similar needs, but there are some differences in what type of tasks they need to perform. All new APIs is technically available to both groups, but some endpoints have authorization to allow only on of the groups.\nApplication Owners A list of common tasks for an application owner:\nQuery instances for a given application according to status or instance owners. Create an application instance. Upload form data and attachments. Download form data. Change process state (workflow). Confirm instance as complete. Application Users A list of common tasks for an application user:\nQuery instances for themselves or a party they can represent (instance owner). Create an application instance. Upload form data and attachments. Download form data. Change process state (workflow). View status of an instance. App API\rThe default APIs exposed by apps in Altinn 3.\nAuthentication API\rDescription of how systems and service owners can use Maskinporten or ID-porten to access APIs in Altinn 3.\nEvents API\rThe Platform API to work with events\nModels\rThis is an overview over most models exposed by the different API. It does not explain every single property of all models, but will try to give a solid introduction to the important parts.\nScenarios\rDifferent API usage scenarios.\nStorage API\rDescription of the Altinn 3 APIs supported by the storage component in the Altinn 3 Platform.\nAltinn Studio Repository API\rThe OpenAPI (swagger) specification for the App source control API.\n"

	"description": "Guidelines should ensure common language and understandibility across services in Altinn.",
	"content": "Usually you should use guidelines from the norwegian language council (nb/nn) while writing. We have also defined some more specific rules for Altinn which we recommend following.\nWe encurage writing form content in both bokmål, nynorsk and english.\nGeneral recommendations Write in a spoken and simple language Write directly to the user (use \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo;) Explain the next step Write short, clearly and clickable Write skimmable texts Be specific about the content, but make sure to write it in a way so that everyone understands. Avoid: Long words Long sentences Cryptic or lyrical labels Multiple points in the same sentence Multiple points in the same paragraph CAPITALS (big letters) Length of text: Headlines/Labels: max. 8 words setninger: 15-20 words paragraps: 40-80 words Write with purpose Formal language is often put together in a way where the statement (verb) comes at the end of the sentence. This means that the user has to read and remember many words before the actual content is reached. This demands more attention of the user, which has to process more information to read the sentence. The verb should be as early as possible in the sentence, and as close to the subject as possible.\nExample:\nThe employer has some duties that must be completed →\nThe employer must complete some duties\nAvoid verbal nouns Verbal nouns make the text unnecessary difficult to read. A verbal noun is a noun created from a verb, for example \u0026ldquo;to investigate\u0026rdquo; becomes \u0026ldquo;to do an investigation\u0026rdquo;, where investigation is the verbal noun. Most verbal nouns end with \u0026ldquo;-ion\u0026rdquo;.\nA text with many verbal nouns often becomes abstract because it removes itself from the actions they really describe. The text becomes more concrete when we use the verbs instead.\nExamples:\nNew inquiry → Inquire Registration of error → Register error Write activly, not passivly: In legal language it is often written that something has to be done and that it isn\u0026rsquo;t desired to say who should do it. In Altinn\u0026rsquo;s solutions there are often multiple people who have to do something, but we can directly address the user.\nExample:\nPreperations and planning activities must be done ahead of development of a service. →\nMake preperations and plan well before you start developing your service.\nSeperation of numbers Correct and consequent seperation of numbers assist the user in reading and seperating different types of numbers. None of the numbers should be seperated by a comma, only by spaces. In fields where the user will write longer numbers, it is usefull to indicate the number of digits.\nOrganisation numbers are seperated in groups of 3: 123 456 789 Bank account numbers are seperated into 4, 2 and 5: 1234 56 78901 SSN should be divided into 6 and 5: 123456 78901 Mobile numbers should be divided into 3, 2 and 3: 987 65 432 Land lines and fax is divided into groups of 2: 98 76 54 32 Time and date Time is only written with hours and minutes, never seconds. Time is written like this: 13:45 Dates should mainly be written like this: 05.06.2017 Sometimes dates can be written in text: 5. juni 2017 "

Alternatively, you can create the application with you as the owner, if you are not testing it in a test environment.\nRequirements from the municipality The application must have a sensible name that makes it easy to find it again among the large number of repositories Sogndal keeps in Altinn Studio.\nThere are no preliminary plans for yearly revisions of the app, so the year does not need to be taken into account.\nThere is a wish that one or more of the words \u0026ldquo;newcomer\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sogndal\u0026rdquo; is included in the name.\nUseful documentation Create app in Altinn Studio Vis/skjul innhold\rUpload data model\rThe municipality of Sogndal has created a data model that represents data they wish to collect from future residents.\nAs an app developer you will in some cases have to create a data model for a service yourself. You will then be able to use the data modelling tool in Altinn Studio (launching Spring 2022), or use an existing data model as a starting point and edit it in for example Visual Studio or a text editing program of your own choosing.\nDownload the xsd-file, open it in a text editing program and take a closer look at the contents.\nUpload the data model in Altinn Studio\nPush the changes to master and take a closer look at the files in the folder App/models\nKnowledge check Which data is it the service owner wishes to collect here? Which effect has \u0026lt;minOccurs\u0026gt; in the data model? You may notice that the field has a different value for Innflytter.Fornavn and Innflytter.Mellomnavn Which other properties is set on the field Innflytter.Mellomnavn? A .C#, .metadata.json and .schema.json file has been generated in addition to the .xsd file you uploaded. What is the correlation between these files? Some restrictions from the data model is not transferred to the C#-file, which ones? Some new properties has also been added, which ones? Useful documentation Upload data model in Altinn Studio Description of indicators in XSD Vis/skjul innhold\rEdit texts\rTo make the service user friendly and available to use for those with visual impairments, it is important that all components have descriptive titles and descriptions.\nIt is possible to connect texts to components in both Altinn Studio and locally.\nNOTE: Display name for the application must be changed in both App/config/applicationMetadata.json and in the text resources.\nRequirements from the municipality All inputfields should have descriptive labels that clarifies what should be filled in. The application must be available in bokmål, nynorsk and english. In a first edition it is sufficient that only one of these languages is available. It is important that the display name of the application sounds good and is descriptive of the service. Useful documentation Edit application texts Formatting of texts ISO 639-1 standard Knowledge check In Altinn we support three languages: bokmål, nynorsk and english.\nHow do you get english language support in the application?

Vis/skjul innhold\rDownload application locally\rSome application features are not supported for development in Altinn Studio. These must be developed in a local development environment.\nThe development itself can be carried out in your preferred development tool, but if you need a recommendation Visual Studio Code is a good option.\nUseful documentation How to clone an application to local development environment How to synchronize changes in local development environment Vis/skjul innhold\rRun application in LocalTest\rBy using a mock that can be spun up locally by Altinn Platform, it is possible to do simple testing and verification of the application in the local development environment.\nIn this task you will be able to run the application locally with support from LocalTest. When the app is running and you have logged in with a test user, you should have a result resembling this:\nMoving on you will want to test your changes continuously in LocalTest.\nIn the event of changes related to formLayout and other json-files, a refresh (F5) in the browser is sufficient. In the event of changes in prefill, the application must be instantiated again. In the event of changes in cs-files, the application must be stopped and restarted. Alternatively, you may use the dotnet run watch when you start the application for hot reload. Useful documentation How to set up LocalTest Debugging of application Available test-users in LocalTest Summary In this module you have created an application in Altinn Studio, uploaded a data model and set up a form page that connects components to some of the fields in the data model. Furthermore, you have cloned the repository locally to further develop the application in your local development environment.\nThe service should be able to run on your local computer with LocalTest and you should be able to fill in the fields.\nRemember to push your local changes to make them available in Altinn Studio when you are happy with them.\nSolution If you have not completed all the steps, we have an example of a solution that you can use as inspiration.\n"

	"content": "In this module you will further develop the application you created in module 1 to fulfil more of the requirements from the municipality of Sogndal.\nThemes covered in this module:\nMore pages Image component Dynamic tracks Prefill Tasks Vis/skjul innhold\rAdd Info Page\rFor forms where a lot of information is given or collected, the user experience will improve if the application is divided in several pages.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a closer look at how you can create a new page in the application that is displayed before the user enters the first data collecting page from module 1.\nTo edit different form pages in Altinn Studio you will need to:\nLog into Altinn Studio Find your application on the dashboard and press Rediger app Navigate to the Lage tab opener To the right you will find the area for administration of form pages Creating and administrating several pages can easily be done in Altinn Studio, but if you prefer to do this manually the documentation may come in handy.\nThe only thing left now is to familiarize yourself with the municipality\u0026rsquo;s requirements for the info page and get started with the development. Good luck!\nRequirements from the municipality Considering that quite a large amount of data is being collected in this service, it is important for the municipality of Sogndal that it is clear who this form is meant for and what the data collected will be used to. Someone in the municipality has created a sketch of the informationpage.\nThe following is desirable to be similar in the application:\nPlacing of pictures Text size Formating of text Sketch of information page\nUseful docmentation Formatting of texts Add pictures to the application Set components side by side File setup with multiple pages Administrate order of muntliple pages Knowledge check Which file in the application repository has to be adjusted if you wish to manually change the page order of existing pages? If you wish to rename a page, but Altinn Studio is not available, which files will need to be updated? How can you get a text to break if the text string is not long enough to break naturally? Vis/skjul innhold\rAlternate workflow\rIn many cases, it is not relevant to answer all questions in a form, maybe because the answer is obvious or because it is not relevant based on an answer provided earlier in the form. In that case, dynamic tracks could be a good solution.\nBy using dynamic tracks you will be able to control which parts of the application that will be visible for the user.\nIn this task you will set up dynamic tracks in the application based on the requirements from the municipality of Sogndal.\nRequirements from the municipality A user who does not meet the requirements for the form should be stopped as early as possible in the workflow.\nOn the information page, the user should be able to state whether the form applies to them or not.\nHow this is done is optional, and the field Innflytter.KanBrukeSkjema in the datamodel is possible to use for this purpose.\nBased on the answer, the user will be sent to either Track 1 or Track 2.\nTrack 1 The user has stated that the form does not apply to them\nThe user should then be sent to a page with the following text:\nDette skjemaet er ikke for deg.\rSe en oversikt over andre tilbud i kommunen her. Line 2 in the text should be a link directing to: https://www.sogndal.kommune.no/\nIt should not be possible to navigate to other pages of the form from this one.\nTrack 2 The user has confirmed that the form does apply to them.\nThe user is sent to the data collecting pages.\nUseful documentation How to set up dynamic tracks Formatting of texts Knowledge check If a user goes back and changes their answer on the info page, will they then be displayed the data collecting pages? If not, what changes can you introduce to support this in your application? If dynamic tracks is implemented further into the workflow and a user changes a choice, what will happen with the form data that was filled out prior to this, if the page is now hidden from the user? Vis/skjul innhold\rPrefill of personal information\rOne of the benefits of Altinn is that you already have metadata containing information about both people and businesses available. By using prefill you can access data about the user and present this in an app, so that they will not have to fill out these fields. Typical prefill values are: name, address, email, etc.\nIf the data is available in one of Altinn\u0026rsquo;s prefill sources, this can be configured towards a field in the data model and be automatically populated once the form is created. If there are other uses for prefill, this can be solved using code in the application.\nIn this task, the focus has returned to the first data collecting page, and the goal is to prefill personal information about the user to save the user some time.\nRequirements from the municipality The following values should be prefilled for the user:\nFirst name: Innflytter.fornavn Middle name: Innflytter.Mellomnavn Last name: Innflytter.Etternavn Email: Innflytter.Kontaktinformasjon.Epost Phone number: Innflytter.Kontaktinformasjon.Telefonnummer Age: Innflytter.Alder It should not be possible to change prefilled name and age\nIt should be possible to change prefilled email and phone number\nUseful documentation Available prefill sources Prefill from national register and user profile Custom prefill Description of the InstanceOwner object Help with code: Calculating age from social security number private static int CalculateAge(string sosialSecNumber) { int MAX_D_NUMBER = 71; int MIN_D_NUMBER = 41; int MAX_TEST_NUMBER = 92; int MIN_TEST_NUMBER = 81; int START_D_NUMBER = 40; int START_TEST_NUMBER = 80; string stringDay = sosialSecNumber.Substring(0, 2); string stringMonth = sosialSecNumber.Substring(2, 2); string stringYear = sosialSecNumber.Substring(4, 2); string stringIndivid = sosialSecNumber.Substring(6, 3); int day = int.Parse(stringDay); int month = int.Parse(stringMonth); int year = int.Parse(stringYear); int individ = int.Parse(stringIndivid); // Get day if D-number if (MAX_D_NUMBER \u0026gt;= day \u0026amp;\u0026amp; MIN_D_NUMBER \u0026lt;= day) { day -= START_D_NUMBER; } // Get month if TestUser-number if (MAX_TEST_NUMBER \u0026gt;= month \u0026amp;\u0026amp; MIN_TEST_NUMBER \u0026lt;= month) { month -= START_TEST_NUMBER; } // find century if (year \u0026gt; 54 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (individ \u0026gt;= 500 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; individ \u0026lt; 750)) { // 1855-1899 year += 1800; } else if (year \u0026gt; 39 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (individ \u0026gt;= 900 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; individ \u0026lt; 1000)) { // 1940-1999 year += 1900; } else if (year \u0026lt; 40 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (individ \u0026gt;= 500 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; individ \u0026lt; 1000)) { // 2000-2039 year += 2000; } else { year += 1900; } // calculate age int age = DateTime.Now.Year - year; if (DateTime.Now.Month \u0026lt; month) { age -= 1; } else if (DateTime.Now.Month == month) { if (DateTime.Now.Day \u0026lt; day) { age -= 1; } } return age; } Knowledge check Is it possible to change a prefilled value once it is set? How can you prevent a user from changing a prefilled value? Not all norwegian citizens have a social security number, some get assigned a D-number. How will you have to adjust your code to take this into account if for example age is based on a F-number or D-number that the user themselves enter? Summary In this module you have expanded your application with more functionality in the sense of adding more pages, configuring dynamic tracks to control user flow and setting up prefill of fields both with available data sources in Altinn and custom code.\nThe service should run on your local computer with local test and you should be able to test both user flows and confirm that the right fields are prefilled.\nRemember to push your local changes, so that they are available in Altinn Studio when you\u0026rsquo;re happy with them\nSolution If you did not manage to complete all the steps, we have an example of a solution that you can use as inspiration.\n"

By overriding these values, smaller applications may save costs, and for bigger applications make sure they have optimal performance with all necessary resources available.\nFor this test application, we want you to scale down resource usage to a minimum.\nScaling: replicaCount: 1\nResource use: Set requests to cpu: 50m and memory: 128Mi\nAll changes related to scaling and resource use are made in the deployment/values.yaml file\nUseful documentation Set custom rules for scaling Set custom limits for resource use Vis/skjul innhold\rBuild application\rWhen you refer to building an application in Altinn Studio, this means creating a version of the current state of the application that can be deployed to one or more environments.\nCreate a new build for the application with version number 0.0.1 and add a descriptive comment of what the version includes.\nUseful documentation Build app in Altinn Studio Vis/skjul innhold\rDeploy application\rBy deploying an application to a test environment you will be able to test all integrations. In addition to this, TT02 is often used to verify an application is behaving as expected before deploying to production.\nTo be able to deploy an application to TT02, the organization that owns the application has to have an app cluster in the test environment. In addition to this, the developer deploying the application needs the role Deploy-TT02 for the organization in Altinn Studio.\nDeploy your application to TT02 and test the different tracks and for pages to confirm that the behaviour is as expected.\nUseful documentation Deploy app to test environment Access control for the organization in Altinn Studio Knowledge check Is it possible to have two versions of one application in TT02 at the same time? What happens if you deploy the same version of the application to the environment once more? Will the application be available immediately after deployment? Is it possible to remove an application from the environment after deployment? Vis/skjul innhold\rTest the application in TT02\rAt the deployment page you will find the direct link to your application. It is in the format {org}.apps.tt02.altinn.no/{org}/{app}\nUnless you\u0026rsquo;re already logged in with a user, this link will bring you to Altinn\u0026rsquo;s login page. Your organization should have access to a set of test users, use one of these to log in.\nFor internal resources in DigDir: Use one of the test users you can find in the test data set and log in.\nSummary In this module you have built and deployed your application to TT02, logged into Altinn with a test user and testet your application.\nSolution If you did not manage to complete all the steps, we have an example of a solution that you can use as inspiration.\n"

	"description": "How to add dynamic tracks in the app.",
	"content": "Dynamic tracks in an application can be useful if you want to show and/or hide some pages based on input from user on previous parts of the form.\nTrigger calculation on tracks from frontend The app will perform an initial call to calculate the order when loading. To trigger calculation of dynamic tracks when switching pages, this needs to be added as a trigger on the navigation component you want. This is done by adding calculatePageOrder ad a part of triggers. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;navigation-button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NavigationButtons\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;next\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Neste\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;back\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Tilbake\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;calculatePageOrder\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;showBackButton\u0026#34;: true } Here, the frontend will make the call to the api defined in the app and use the list returned to determine which page it will go to when the user presses next. This order will also be stored in the state frontend, so that navigating will work both backwards and forwards on the given order returned from the backend.\nIf you wish to trigger calculation on every single page switch, this can be done by either entering calculatePageOrder as part of triggers for all the navigation components in the application, or by adding a trigger in Settings.json under the pages section. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/layout/layoutSettings.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;order\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Side1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Side2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Side3\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;calculatePageOrder\u0026#34;] } } If triggers is set on the navigation component, this will overrule triggers set in Settings.json, and by doing this it is possible to control default behaviour on component level if desirable.\nSetting up dynamic tracks backend (nuget version \u0026gt; 5.0.0) To overrule default dynamic tracks, two changes must be made.\nCreate a class implementing the interface IPageOrder Register this class as a Transient in Program.cs in the method ConfigureServices. Typically like this: services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IPageOrder, CustomOrder\u0026gt;(); Create separate class for controlling dynamic tracks Create a new class in your application, e.g. under the folder App/logic/Pages (the folder is not created by default). This class must implement the interface IPageOrder. The interface contains a method with the name GetPageOrder. The expected output from this is a sorted list with the names of the relevant pages in the application.\nusing System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Models; using Altinn.App.Services.Interface; using Altinn.App.PlatformServices.Models; namespace Altinn.App.AppLogic.Pages { public class CustomOrder : IPageOrder { /// \u0026lt;inheritdoc /\u0026gt; public async Task\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;\u0026gt; GetPageOrder(AppIdentifier appIdentifier, InstanceIdentifier instanceIdentifier, string layoutSetId, string currentPage, string dataTypeId, object formData) { List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; pageOrder = new List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;(); // Implement your logic here. return await Task.FromResult(pageOrder); } } } The function provides a number of parameters that can be useful if you are using form data or other information about the user to trigger the dynamic tracks.\nappIdentifier Contains organization and app name for the application\ninstanceIdentifier Contains InstanceOwnerPartyId and InstanceGuid. If the application is stateless the object will be blank (InstanceIdentifier.NoInstance). If GetInstanceId is called on an InstanceIdentifier.NoInstance, an exception will be thrown.\nlayoutSetId If your app defines multiple layout sets, the id on the layout set in question will be submitted. If the application does not have a layout set, this string will be empty. Based on this parameter the default page order defined in the application can be retrieved.\nList\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; pageOrder = new List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;(); if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(layoutSetId)) { pageOrder = _appResourcesService.GetLayoutSettings().Pages.Order; } else { pageOrder = _appResourcesService.GetLayoutSettingsForSet(layoutSetId).Pages.Order; } This prequires that the service IAppResources is made available in the class. When the service is already available through dependency injected into the class, only two steps are required:\nCreate a private variable in the state of the class private readonly IAppResources _appResourcesService; Define a constructor that takes in IAppResources and initializes the private variable that was created in step 1. public CustomOrder(IAppResources appResourcesService) { _appResourcesService = appResourcesService; } CurrentPage The page you want to navigate from will be specified in this parameter.\nFormData contains the form data. This can easily be worked with as an object by casting it to the right type Skjema skjema = (Skjema)formdata;. Here, the C# model\u0026rsquo;s name is Skjema, but for your application the name could be different. You can check this by finding the class name of the C# file in the App/models folder.\nReflect dynamic tracks in receipt (PDF) As an app developer you must make sure to reflect the dynamic track choices made in the PDF that is created at the end of each task. In App.cs the function FormatPdf can be found:\npublic override async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { return await _pdfHandler.FormatPdf(layoutSettings, data); } As input to the method you have layoutSettings which contains the default page order under the property layoutSettings.Pages.Order. In addition, you have the form data that is associated with the step to be completed. This can be parsed to a C# model as described further up on this page.\nBy manipulating layoutSettings.Pages.Order in this method, it will be possible to duplicate the dynamic track choices made for the user. NOTE! The call to PDF handler, as shown below, must not be removed from the FormatPDF method, if you have implemented additional logic for the receipt in PDFHandler.cs.\nreturn await _pdfHandler.FormatPdf(layoutSettings, data); To avoid duplicating logic, we recommend creating a method that manipulates the page order based on form data and calling this both from FormatPdf and GetPageOrder. A code example of such an implementation follows. This can, for example, be placed in the same class that implements the interface IPageOrder to keep all logic for order in the same place.\nIn the class implementing logic for page order:\npublic async Task\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;\u0026gt; GetPageOrder(AppIdentifier appIdentifier, InstanceIdentifier instanceIdentifier, string layoutSetId, string currentPage, string dataTypeId, object formData) { List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; pageOrder = new List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;(); if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(layoutSetId)) { pageOrder = _appResourcesService.GetLayoutSettings().Pages.Order; } else { pageOrder = _appResourcesService.GetLayoutSettingsForSet(layoutSetId).Pages.Order; } UpdatePageOrder(pageOrder, (FavorittArtist)formData); return pageOrder; } public void UpdatePageOrder(List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; pageOrder, FavorittArtist formdata) { if (formdata.EnGodNrTo.Contains(\u0026#34;Tix\u0026#34;)) { pageOrder.Remove(\u0026#34;Prince\u0026#34;); } else { pageOrder.Remove(\u0026#34;Tix\u0026#34;); } } The method is then called from the method FormatPdf in App.cs\npublic override async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { UpdatePageOrder(layoutSettings.Pages.Order, (FavorittArtist)data); return await _pdfHandler.FormatPdf(layoutSettings, data); } "

Evaluate if further explanation and helper texts should be connected to the element. Two input fields can be placed beside each other if they are somehow connected, see the example below. Deactivated fields should be avoided. If a field cannot be edited, the information should instead be presented as text. Example of usage: Width of an input field The width of an input field should reflect what is expected as input from the user. We currently have three standard sizes that should reflect most scenarios and cover different screen-sizes. Read more about how to change the sizes here.\nSmall inputs The smaller inputs are more fitting for collecting information like phone number, postage number and year.\n\u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;innergrid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;:5, \u0026#34;sm\u0026#34;:3, \u0026#34;md\u0026#34;:2 } } Medium input Can be used for collecting information like municipality or country\n\u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;innergrid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;:8, \u0026#34;sm\u0026#34;:6, \u0026#34;md\u0026#34;:6 } } Long input Can be used for collecting information like name, e-mail address or a URL\n\u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;innergrid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;sm\u0026#34;:10 } } Large textfields Large text fields are used when the user has to fill in a longer explanation. Large text fields follow the same guidelines as input fields.\nExample of usage: Adress For addresses, there is a rigid setup where the post number and postage place is on the same line, below the address input line. Postage place is filled automatically based on post-number-input.\nExample of usage: "

	"description": "Guidelines for using React in Altinn Studio",
	"content": "React React is a library for developing component based applications. It is done by having declared html as xml in javascript code, and that is again transpiled into vanilla javascript for the browser to render into a page.\nGet started by looking at the Getting started docs or trying the tutorial.\nImportant concepts The 2 most important concepts when working with React components are state and props.\nState is a collection of properties, controlled by the component, that say what the current state of the component is - this can be used to determine how the component should be rendered.\nProps is a collection of properties that are passed to the component as input. They can also be used to determine how the component should render.\nAny time the state or props of a component is updated, the component re-renders.\nClass components Class components are React components defined as classes. We used class components when we started building Altinn Studio, and most of the components for the Altinn Studio applications are still class components.\n// Example component import * as React from React export interface IExampleComponentProps { id: string; title: string; } export interface IExampleComponentState { value: string; } export class ExampleComponent extends React.Component\u0026lt;IExampleComponentProps, IExampleComponentState\u0026gt; { public onChange = (event: any) =\u0026gt; { setState(event.target.value); } public render( \u0026lt;div id={this.props.id}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label htmlFor={`input-${this.props.id}`}\u0026gt;{this.props.title}\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input id={`input-${this.props.id}`} value={this.state.value} onChange={this.onChange} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } Read more about class components here.\nWhen writing a new component, or refactoring an existing class component, use hooks where possible.\nFunctional components - React hooks Hooks are new in React 16.8, and allow us to use state directly in functional components - components that are defined as functions. Using functional components with hooks results in cleaner, shorter code. Most of the components for the Altinn Apps applications are functional components using hooks.\n// Example component import * as React from React export interface IExampleComponentProps { id: string; title: string; } export function ExampleComponent(props: IExampleComponentProps) : JSX.Element { const [value, setValue] = React.useState\u0026lt;string\u0026gt;(\u0026#39;\u0026#39;); const onChange = (event: any) =\u0026gt; { setValue(event.target.value); } return( \u0026lt;div id={props.id}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;label htmlFor={`input-${props.id}`}\u0026gt;{props.title}\u0026lt;/label\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input id={`input-${props.id}`} value={value} onChange={onChange} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } Read more about React hooks here\nLinks Documentation for react components "

	"content": "Solution - Application code Module 1 Module 2 Module 3 Module 4 Module 5 Module 6 Module 1 - Knowledge check: Upload data model Which data is it the service owner wishes to collect here? The data model consists of one main element: innflytter (newcomer). This element consists of some subelements like Fornavn, Etternavn and Mellomnavn. Additionally there are some complex elements such as Adresse, Kontaktinformasjon and Arbeidsinformasjon.\nWhich effect has \u0026lt;minOccurs\u0026gt; in the data model? You may notice that the field has different value for Innflytter.Fornavn and Innflytter.Mellomnavn minOccurs_ says something about how many times times the object must at least be mentioned.\nminOccurs = 0 means that the field is not required, minOccurs=1 means that you expect the field to appear at least once in the model.\nWhich other properties is set on the field Innflytter.Mellomnavn? nillable=trueis defined on the mellomnavn-field. This means that null is a legal value for middle name.\nA .C#, .metadata.json and .schema.json file has been generated in addition to the .xsd file you uploaded. What is the correlation between these files? The mentioned files are all generated from the xsd-description of the data model. They describe all the data and the data field\u0026rsquo;s properties. All properties are not necessarily transferred to all the files, but the sum of them should cover what is described in the xsd-file.\nThe C#-model is used by app backend to deserialize the data and make it available for processing and validation. .metadata.json is used in Altinn Studio to easily connect components and dynamics to the data fields. The .schema.json file is used by altinn-app-frontend for form validation on the client side. Some restrictions from the data model is not transferred to the C#-file, which ones? Some new properties has also been added, which ones? minOccurs, maxOccurs are not transferred to the model. nillable is only transferred on some types e.g. decimal. XmlElement.Order is introduced as a decoration on each property. This ensures that the order of the elements will stay the same when the data is serialized to xml. Module 1 - Knowledge check: Set up components Can you locate the component connected to the email-field? There are several ways to locate a field in FormLayout.json. The fastest way is often to search the name of the field that the component is attached to. You can find this under dataModelBindings.\nWhat change is required in this file if the email-field is no longer required? To make a field optional you can change \u0026ldquo;required=true\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;required=false\u0026rdquo;\nBy changing one line in FormLayout.json it is possible to change the component attached to middle name to an input field for a long answer. What change is required? The solution is to change the type field from Input to TextArea as shown below\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;mellomnavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TextArea\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;innflytter.mellomnavn\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Innflytter.Mellomnavn\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: false }, Module 1 - Knowledge check: Edit texts How do you implement english language support in the application? _resources.nb.json will be autogenerated in all new repositories in the folder config/texts. To support english in an application, the file resources.en.json must be created. Note that the language property at the top of the file must be set to en.\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [] } If we one day were to support ukrainian, which language code would you then need to annotate the file with? According to the list of ISO 639-1 codes, the code for ukranian is uk.\nIf a text key referred to in FormLayout.json does not exist in the text resources, what will appear on the screen? If said text key does not exist inthe text resource file, the text key will be displayed instead.\nModule 2 - Knowledge check: Add info page Which file in the application repository has to be adjusted if you wish to manually change the page order of existing pages? In App/ui/Settings.json you can find the page order.\nTo adjust the page order, the list under pages.order must be changed to represent desired order.\nIf you wish to rename a page, but Altinn Studio is not available, which files will need to be updated? Settings.json: change the name of the page under pages.order App/ui/layouts: change the file name of the page that you\u0026rsquo;re changing the name of How can you get a text to break if the text string is not long enough to break naturally? All text resources support markdown and thus html-notation, so by using \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; you will be able to force text breaks.\nModule 2 - Knowledge check: Alternative workflow If a user goes back and changes their answer on the info page, will they then be displayed the data collecting pages? If not, what changes can you introduce to support this in your application? In App/logic/App.cs you can find the method GetPageOrder. This is called on from the frontend when you leave a component that has configured \u0026quot;triggers\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;calculatePageOrder\u0026quot;] in the layout file.\nTake a look at the solution for this module to see how this is done. Files of interest are App/ui/layouts/info.json and App/logic/App.cs.\nIf dynamic tracks is implemented further into the workflow and a user changes a choice, what will happen with the form data that was filled out prior to this, if the page is now hidden from the user? If you have implemented this type of logic in an application where you can continue to submitting for multiple tracks, the data on the page(s) that are now hidden for the user should be nulled.\nModule 2 - Knowledge check: Prefill of personal information Is it possible to change a prefilled value once it is set? Yes, if you don\u0026rsquo;t make any changes a standard component wih prefilled data will be editable.\nHow can you prevent a user from changing a prefilled value? The component can be set to readonly. Alternatively you can run validations of the data server side to verify that the data in the field matches the data from the prefill page. This can be done in the process- or validation logic of the application.\nNot all norwegian citizens have a social security number, some get assigned a D-number. How will you have to adjust your code to take this into account if for example age is based on a F-number or D-number that the user themselves enter? A D-number is eleven digit, like normal social security numbers, and consists of a modified six digit birthdate and a five digit personal number. The birth date is modified by adding 4 to the first digit: a person born january 1st 1980 will then get the birth date 410180, while one born january 31st 1980 will get 710180. One way to go from any f- or d-number to a string for birth date on the format dd-MM-yy is:\npublic static string GetDOB(string fOrDNumber){ List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; firstCharsInDNumber = new(){\u0026#34;4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;5\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;6\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;7\u0026#34; }; var fOrDNumberArray = fOrDNumber.ToCharArray(); char[] dobArray = new char[6]; Array.Copy(fOrDNumberArray, dobArray, 6); char firstChar = dobArray[0]; int firstInt = 0; if(firstCharsInDNumber.Contains(firstChar.ToString())) { firstInt = firstChar - 4; dobArray[0] = (char)firstInt; } string dobString = $\u0026#34;{dobArray[0]}{dobArray[1]}.{dobArray[2]}{dobArray[3]}.{dobArray[4]}{dobArray[5]}\u0026#34;; // verify that it is a valid date DateTime.ParseExact(dobString, \u0026#34;dd.MM.yy\u0026#34;, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture); return dobString; } Module 3 - Knowledge check: Deploy application Is it possible to have two versions of one application in TT02 at the same time? No, it is only possible to have one version of the application out in the environment at once. If you deploy a different version, the existing version of the application will be overwritten.\nWhat happens if you deploy the same version of the application to the environment once more? All operations connected to deploy will run again. Resource texts and other metadata are savedin Altinn Platform, and deploy pipeline to toll out the application to the cluster will also run.\nHowever, no new pods will be spun up in connection to this since there are now real changes on the service running in the environment.\nWill the application be available immediatly after deployment? Yes, the service will be immediately available after deployment. If the status is green in Altinn Studio you will be able to run the application.\nIs it possible to remove an application from the environment after deployment? As of March 2022 it is not possible for a service owner to remove an application from an environment themselves once it has been deployed. The service owner would have to contact support. By the end of the year a function where the service owner themselves can do this will be made available.\nModule 4 - Knowledge check: Collection of work information What is the difference between static and dynamic options? Static options are defined build time and will, as the name suggests, be static during their lifetime. Dynamic options are collected runtime and can therefore get a value based on the time of the day or other dynamic values.\nWhat will the area of use be for secured dynamic options? Options are by default openly available and the API will be reachable for those who are not logged in to the app. There are also no restrictions on roles or anything else. In some cases you might want to expose options that are sensitive. This is where safe dynamic options come in, where you get automatic verification that the person making the call has Instance.Read rights.\nModule 4 - Knowledge check: Differentiated data base for public and private sector If a list of options is set up with mapping towards the data model - what happens when the field in question changes value? If a field in the mapping is updated, the app-frontend will make another call to retrieve the options lsit. This opens up for the possibility to dynamically show options that are tailored to the user\u0026rsquo;s previously submitted data.\nWhat happens with the chosen value on a field connected to an option-list that is retrieved over again from the server side? If the user e.g. has chosen a muncipality from a dropdown list containing muncipalities set up with mapping on Fylke, then returns and changes the field Fylke, the answer in the muncipality list will be remowed.\nModule 4 - Knowledge check: Tailored offer for IT competence If you add a new function to RuleHandlerHelper - where will these functions run? Would dynamic work without this defined? Functions defined in RuleHandlerHelper.js run as support functions when you set up the dynamic in Altinn Studio. Dynamics can be set up without these defined and will still work if you have configured the functions in RuleHandlerObject.js and the definitions are in RuleConfiguration.json.\nIf you were to add a new function to RuleHandlerHelper.js - where will these functions run? Would dynamic work without this defined? Functions defined in RuleHandlerObject.js are actually dynamic uploaded by app-frontend and runs as part om the application flow for the user. Dynmaics will not work without this defined.\nWhat is the correlation between functions defined in RuleHandlerObject and the file RuleConfiguration.json? RuleConfiguration.json is a configuration that says something about which fields the actual rule in RuleHandlerObject should be used on and possibly which effect it should have. A function defined in RuleHandlerObject can be set up multiple times in RuleConfiguration.json. You can almost think of it as \u0026ldquo;instances\u0026rdquo; of the function.\nModule 5 - Knowledge check: Expand process with confirmation step Which Altinn-specific traits are on every process task? altinn:tasktype is defined for each task.\nWhich limitations would an external BPMN editor have when editing the process description of an Altinn app? Altinn-specific traits would probably not be imported or exported when working on the model.\nIs it possible for the process flow to go both ways? From filling in to confirmation and from confirmation to filling in? SequenceFlow in the bpmn-file only describes the flow going one way, from filling out to confirmation. Therefore the flow cannot go both ways.\nModule 5 - Knowledge check: Add authorization rules for confirmation step What will happen when the process flow proceeds to the confirmation step without the authorization rules being updated? The application will display \u0026ldquo;Unknown error\u0026rdquo; when the usr presses the Submit button.\nWhat happens if you don\u0026rsquo;t specify which roles are allowed to perform an action in an authorization rule? Then all users, with or without roles, will be allowed to perform the confirm operation for the application.\nModule 5 - Knowledge check: Validation of submitter Which change would you suggest for the client to be able to meet this requirement without adding custom validation at this step? By rather changing policy so that only the role PRIV, which is only delegated by a private person on behalf of themselves, has the permission to perform the action confirm, the authorization rules will do the check, which currently is set up as custom validation, automatically.\nModule 6 - Knowledge check: Repeating groups What field in the data model decides if an element is repeating? The field maxOccurs in the xsd-model says something about wether a field is repetitive. If maxOccurs \u0026gt; 1\nHow many repetitions are allowed for the field TidligereBosteder? 10 repetitions are allowed for TidligereBosteder.\nModule 6 - Knowledge check: Validation When are validations server-side running? Validations on the server side are run as standard only when the user chooses to move on from a step. This behaviour can be overrun, and it is possible to trigger validations both on single fields and e.g. when switching between different pages.\nWhy should validations added on the client side also be duplicated server-side? Client-side validations should be considered as an aid for better user experience and not as a guarantee that data is delivered in the correct format. People who don\u0026rsquo;t mean well can get past these validations, and client-side validations will not be run if, for exapmle, you use the APIs directly. Therefore, validations placed on the front-end should always be reflected in the back-end logic.\nModule 6 - Knowledge check: Data processing When is data processing running? Data processing is run every time the user either reads or writes data. That is, every time the user changes a given field, the logic will run. This therefore requires that the app developer optimizes the code that is executed and avoid heavy and complex operations on each calculation.\nWhat seperates ProcessDataWrite and ProcessDataRead? ProcessDataWrite is run once the user writes data, i.e. when the user has filled in a field or updates an existing value. ProcessDataRead is run once the user reads data from the data base, e.g. when navigating to a previous instance of the application and retrieving previously filled in data.\nWhat is the difference between DataProcessing and Calculations? DataProcessing and calculations are two different names to the same concept. In the nuget-packets pre 4.7.0, this went under the name calculations or kalkuleringer, while it is now reffered to as DataProcessing.\n"

	"content": "\rThis is new functionality. Setup must be done manually for now. Support for setup through Altinn Studio will be launched shortly.\nNOTE: to use this functionality you need app-frontend version 3. See this link for changes that is required in the app.\nComponents placed side by side (grid) It is possible to place components side by side in a form. This functionality is based on the grid system from Material-UI, and is similar to the grid system from bootstrap. The grid system is based on a construction of containers in 12 parts, where you can assign children (items) of a grid-container a given part of this width. Material-UI also offers the ability to dynamically change how much of the screen you want to occupy based on which screen size the user is on. The following sizes with breakpoints are defined:\nxs: 0px sm: 600px md: 1024px lg: 1440px xl: 1920px To place components side by side horizontally, small changes must be done in formlayout. A seperate property grid has been defined, where you can fill in desired width on the different sizes. Here is an example where two input fields has been set to cover half the screen (some props are removed for readability):\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 6, } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt-2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 6 } } } For the components above, the size has been set to 6 (half width) for the size xs. Since: xs is the smallest size available, this will apply from size xs and up, i.e. from xs to xl. The setup above will give the following result:\nSince there are 12 sections available on the page width, it is up to the app developer to assign how large of a share a component should have. If you want a component to take up 2/12, and another 6/12 and the last one 4/12, then this is possible. It is important to consider the user experience when performing these changes, and before you place components side by side you should think it through. Components with longer texts and descriptions quickly become small and unclear if these are placed side by side. If you are to use longer texts and descriptions it is recommended that these occupy the full width of the form.\nIf you in the example above wanted the components to take up the whole width of the screen, until the screen passed 960px in size, you could set up the following layout:\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;sm\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;md\u0026#34;: 6 } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt-2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;sm\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;md\u0026#34;: 6 } } } Then, the components would not be be placed side by side unless the user is using a screen of 960px or more.\ninnerGrid og labelGrid In addition to setting the width of the grid in the component, we also have added the opportunity to control innerGrid and labelGrid. This gives you the opportunity to control the width of label and input in the same way. This is typically used when you want to make an input field smaller (to give a visual indication that a small answer is expected), or if you want to display label and input on the same line (like in a table.)\nYou can think of the component in this manner:\n\u0026lt;Grid id=\u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Grid id=\u0026#34;labelGrid\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Komponentens tekster \u0026lt;/Grid\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Grid id=\u0026#34;innerGrid\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Komponentens input \u0026lt;/Grid\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Grid\u0026gt; Here, you will have the opportunity to control the width of both the outer grid and the inner grid. Example:\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 12, \u0026#34;innerGrid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;xs\u0026#34;: 6 } } } } Here, it has been set that the component grid shall occupy the whole width, while limiting the component\u0026rsquo;s input to only occupy half the width. Innergrid can be controlled for these components:\nInput TextArea FileUpload Dropdown Datepicker The example above will give the following output:\nA tableview with labels placed to the side will appear if you set labelGrid and innerGrid so that the sum equals 12 (or less). This may be wise if you have a long list of related questions. It is often wise to not use such a layout on the smallest screens, so feel free to use md.\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;grid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;labelGrid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;md\u0026#34;: 8 }, \u0026#34;innerGrid\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;md\u0026#34;: 4 } } } } This will look something like this:\nFormatting numbers Support has now been implemented to be able to specify formatting of numbers in input fields. This is done by adding a property formatting to the input component. Formatting options are documented in a JSON-schema, and will appear automatically in intellisense when editing the component in e.g. VSCode.\nThe example below will result in an input field for numbers, where the number will be formatted with , between each thousand, and $ in front of the number.\nThe formatting is for frontend display only, and the numbers added to an input field with formatting will be saved unformatted.\r{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;numberComponent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;number\u0026#34;, }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;someNumberField\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;formatting\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;number\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;thousandSeparator\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;,\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$\u0026#34; } } }, Aligning text in input fields When a schema contains a list of numbers that are automatically summarized, it is common to align text to the right, like when summarizing on paper and how Excel shows numbers. This can be done by setting \u0026quot;align\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;right\u0026quot; under formatting on the input componenten. Other valid values are \u0026quot;center\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;left\u0026quot;.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;numberComponent\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;formatting\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;number\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;thousandSeparator\u0026#34;: \u0026#34; \u0026#34;, \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;kr \u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;align\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;right\u0026#34; } }, "

	"content": "\rThis is new functionality. Setup must be done manually as of today. Support for setup through Altinn Studio will be available at a later point in time.\rNOTE: The PDF generation, as of today, does not support the summary component. For PDF generating to work, either all the summary components or the whole summary-page(s) must be excluded from PDF. This is done in the Settings.json-file attached to the layout-files.\nSetup Display of summary is set up in the same manner as the other form components in a form. You can choose to have the summary on it\u0026rsquo;s own page, or on the same page as other form components.\nThe summary component is very simple, and refers to the component that is to be summarized and the page this is on. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;summary-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;komponent-id\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pageRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;side komponenten er definert på\u0026gt;\u0026#34; }, The component displays a summary of data from the specified component. In addition, the user gets the opportunity to return to the relevant component/page to make changes.\nThe display differs depending on which form component the summary refers to.\nNote: PDF-generating does not support a summary page, so it has to be excluded by changing ui/Settings.json\n\u0026#34;pages\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;excludeFromPdf\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;name-of-summary-page\u0026#34; ] } Simple form component These are components that are only connected to one field in the data model. E.g. Input, Dropdown, Checkbox/Radio, etc.\nThe summary displays the prompt for the form component and attached data. If there is an active error message attached to the form component, this will also be displayed.\nAddress component This component includes multiple fields. The display is the same as that of a simple form component, so the fields are merged into a simple text.\nFile attachments The summary display for file attachments displays a list of the attachments that are uploaded for the component in question.\nRepeating groups Nested groups Summary is also supported for nested repeating groups. We only support one level of nested groups. In this case, the summary of each element of the group at the top level is displayed as its own category, and the group at the lowest level is displayed in the same manner as a normal repeating group.\nTo support summary display of nested groups, the following setup must be done in the layout-file:\nRefer to the main group in componentRef in the summary component Set \u0026quot;largeGroup\u0026quot;: true on the summary component Example With the following setup of a nested group in layout:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;main-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hovedgruppe\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model.mainGroup\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;nested-group-1\u0026#34; ], ... // remaining setup of component }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nested-group-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Undergruppe\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model.mainGroup.subGroup\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;input-field-1\u0026#34; ], ... // remaining setup of component }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-field-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Skriv inn noe her\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model.mainGroup.subGroup.field1\u0026#34; }, ... // remaining setup of component } Set up the summary in the following manner:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;summary-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Summary\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;main-group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;pageRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;FormLayout\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;largeGroup\u0026#34;: true, } Categories It is possible to group the summaries in different categories to make a summary page more clear.

Add correct validation and give the user information about what are valid and invalid dates. Should the user be able to select dates further back in time? Within a given period? Example of usage: Date field Date fields should be used for dates further back in time, or for dates that the user knows well. Three textfields is the simplest way to take in dates in these cases. If someone is planning something and a specific day (monday, friday, etc.) is important the datepicker should be used instead.\n⚠️ This component is not accessible in Altinn Studio yet.\nGuidelines: Always label the input boxes (day, month, year), and add a label/heading for the input group as well. If the foundational data exists, a specific date can be suggested in the field, or it can be preset with the current date. "

Before developing starts, we thus would like to be included in specifying how the component should be designed, both functionally and technically. To achieve a nice workflow for developing, dialogue is essential.\nIn this dialogue we will:\nDiscover what needs the component should meet, and discuss the solution Identify any shortcomings in the design or technical solution that needs to be overcome Decide if we should help you with design or user testing Development handbook All information you need to get started is included in our development handbook. The handbook includes information on how to write consistent code and build new components.\nAccessability testing Apps built on Altin 3 must be accessible for everyone, and to ensure that this is the case we follow the WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Please see the demands described at the Norwegian Authority for Universal Design of ICT or a11yproject.\nReview of component When a pull request is made we will do a review of your component. Hopefully we have already agreed how the component should be made before development started, thus reducing the need for large changes at this stage.\nTesting WCAG testing Code review Design review If we do find something that needs improvement, we will contact you about further development.\n"

This will host all files that is inside the /app/wwwroot folder. If this folder does not exist, it needs to be created. If you want to refer to the file app/wwwroot/bilde_nb.png it can be reached at the following relative url /org/app-name/bilde_nb.png\napplicationId is a variable from a few lines above containing org/app-name from applicationmetadata.json:\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env) { // ... app.UseRouting(); app.UseStaticFiles(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39; + applicationId); app.UseAuthentication(); // ... } In FormLayout.json the reference to the image should be a relative url that starts with /org/app-name similar to what was set up as the static hosting. You can also use the custom prefix wwwroot (without a starting /), that will be replaced with /org/app-name before the image is loaded.\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;616071dc-90b1-4ce5-8d18-492844828a41\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Image\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;altTextImg\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;imgAltText\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;image\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;src\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;wwwroot/bilde_nb.png\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;width\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;100%\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;align\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;center\u0026#34; } } ] } } "

An instance can be regarded as an envelope or folder where data is collected and exchanged between the application user and owner. The instance document is a way for Altinn and external parties to track the state of one specific data exchange.\nProperties Name Description id A gobally unique id for the instance. The value has two parts separated by a \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; character. The first part is the internal unique id of the instance owner and the second part is a generated UUID value. instanceOwner A complex type identifying the owner of the instance. See InstanceOwner appId The id for the app the instance is associated with. The value has two parts separated by a \u0026lsquo;/\u0026rsquo; character. The first part is the short name/identifier of the owner of the app and the second part is the app name. org The short name of the app owner. selfLinks A complex type containing a set of named URLs. See ResourceLinks dueBefore This can be use by app owner to indicate a deadline for when the instance must be completed and submitted by a user that can represent the instance owner. visibleAfter This can be used by app owner to have an instance become visible for app users at a given date and time. This way an instance can be created in advance and populated with data before being available to an application user. process A complex type tracking the process state of the instance. See ProcessState status A complex type with more state data. See InstanceStatus completeConfirmations A list of complete confirmations. See CompleteConfirmation data A list of data elements. This include all forms, attachments and other data types being collected. See DataElement presentationTexts A dictionary with text values extracted from forms that are saved on the instance. Values are extracted based on PresentationField values stored in the application metadata document. Also see PresentationField dataValues A dictionary with data values extracted from forms that are saved on the instance. Values are extracted based on configured data fields in the applicationmetadata document. Also see DataField created The date and time when the instance was first initialized. createdBy An idenfificator indicating who it was that created the instance. lastChanged The date and time when the instance was last changed. lastChangedBy An idenfificator indicating who it was that made the last change to the instance. InstanceOwner The InstanceOwner model is a simple definition whose only porpose is to hold a universally known identification value of the instance owner.\nProperties Name Description partyId A value used internally by Altinn to uniquely identify an entity across Organisations, Persons and Self identified users. personNumber If the instance owner is a person this field is populated with a person number from the National Population Register in Norway. organisationNumber If the instance owner is an organisation this field is populated with an organisation number from the National Unit Register in Norway. username If the instance owner is a self identified user this field is populated with a user name. InstanceStatus The InstanceStatus model is used to hold key status related metadata about an instance. All information is also tracked through instance events, but this is an easily accessible summary of the last events.\nProperties Name Description archived The date and time for when an archived instance was archived. softDeleted The date and time for when a deleted instance were moved to the recycle bin. hardDeleted The date and time for when an instance became unrecoverable through any API. A few days later the instance and all its data will be physically deleted from storage and truly unrecoverable. readStatus A field indicating whether an application user has opened the instance at any time. Used internally by the message box to indicate read status of elements. substatus A property with human readable status information that will be displayed by the message box. CompleteConfirmation The CompleteConfirmation model is a simple type for holding information about who and when a given stakeholder has told Altinn that the instance is no longer needed. They have obtained all the information they needed from the instance. The instance can be deleted permanently should an application user decide to to so. At the time of writing an instance can have only one stakeholder and that is the Application Owner.\nDataValues Data values are values either extracted from the instance data or other sources. The values are stored with the instance for easy access and can be used for example in routing logic on the receiving end.\nWhile data fields configured in the app metadata file will be extracted and automatically picked up by the application, there is also the option of adding values manually by using the UpdataDataValues method from the IInstance interface. You can mix and match data fields from configuration and by manually adding. It\u0026rsquo;s the UpdateDataValues method that is called under the hood in both cases. UpdateDataValues merges the incoming collection with what\u0026rsquo;s allready stored. However if yo specify the same id it will be overwritten by one or the other and you have no guaranties on which is stored.\nValues passed in to the UpdataDataValues can have any source and is not restricted to data stored in the application. It can be called from any place but it\u0026rsquo;s recomended to not call it more than strictly required. A good place is to override the RunProcessTaskEnd method from AppBase causing the method to be called when a task is completed.\nProperties Name Description stakeholderId The short name of an application owner. confirmedOn The date and time for when the application owner confirmed that they consider the instance as no longer needed in Altinn. ProcessState The process state model keeps track of the process of a specific instance.\nProperties Name Description started Date and time for when the process was initially started. startEvent The name of the start event triggering the beginning of the process. currentTask A complex model keeping track of current process step. See ProcessElementInfo ended Date and time for when the process was finished. endEvent The name of the end event that the process ended with. ProcessElementInfo The process element info holds information about the current task in the process.\nProperties Name Description flow A step counter that increase every time the process moves forward. started Date and time for when the instance entered the current step. elementId The unique id of current process task. name The name of the task. (Human readable.) altinnTaskType The type of task. validated A date and time for when the instance was validated as well as a value indicating if the task can be completed without additional changes and a new validation. ResourceLinks The resource link model is should have a collection of URLs that can be used to obtain a copy of the instance document through different API. The propose is to make it easy to switch between API. Primarily when the original was obtain from the storage instance query API and you need to use the app API to perform changes on the instance.\nProperties Name Description apps Contains a URL for the endpoint to use to obtain a copy of the current instance document through the app API. platform Contains a URL for the endpoint to use to obtain a copy of the current instance document through the Platform Storage API. Complete example This example was created by instantiating an app running locally on a development machine using LocalTest. The process is at first step, Task_1, and it has a single data element which is the main form of the app.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instanceOwner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;partyId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;personNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;01039012345\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organisationNumber\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;username\u0026#34;: null }, \u0026#34;appId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd/bli-applikasjonseier\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;org\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selfLinks\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;apps\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinn3local.no/ttd/bli-applikasjonseier/instances/1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinn3local.no/storage/api/v1/instances/1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dueBefore\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;visibleAfter\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;process\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;started\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-18T15:56:41.5662973Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;startEvent\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;StartEvent_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;currentTask\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;flow\u0026#34;: 2, \u0026#34;started\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-18T15:56:41.5664762Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;elementId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Utfylling\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;altinnTaskType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ended\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;validated\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;timestamp\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-20T13:00:05.1800273+00:00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;canCompleteTask\u0026#34;: true } }, \u0026#34;ended\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;endEvent\u0026#34;: null }, \u0026#34;status\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;completeConfirmations\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8a8a01ae-9533-4aa9-b914-8ab0fae6ea0d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instanceGuid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Kursdomene_BliTjenesteeier_M_2020-05-25_5703_34553_SERES\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;filename\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;contentType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;blobStoragePath\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd/bli-applikasjonseier/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814/data/8a8a01ae-9533-4aa9-b914-8ab0fae6ea0d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selfLinks\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;apps\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinn3local.no/ttd/bli-applikasjonseier/instances/1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814/data/8a8a01ae-9533-4aa9-b914-8ab0fae6ea0d\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;platform\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinn3local.no/storage/api/v1/instances/1337/bd9edd59-b18c-4726-aa9e-6b150eade814/data/8a8a01ae-9533-4aa9-b914-8ab0fae6ea0d\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;size\u0026#34;: 401, \u0026#34;locked\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;refs\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;created\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-18T15:56:43.1089008Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;createdBy\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;lastChanged\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-18T15:56:43.1089008Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChangedBy\u0026#34;: null } ], \u0026#34;created\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-18T15:56:42.1972942Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;createdBy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChanged\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2020-11-18T15:56:42.1972942Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChangedBy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337\u0026#34; } "

Det er også her man styrer CPU og minne allokering. Du finner Chart.yamlog values.yamli deployment mappen i applikasjonen din. Dette er viktige filer som kan være lett å overse og ikke ha et aktivt forhold til.\nTips 1 - Kjør siste versjon av Helm Chart Med siste versjon får du de mest oppdaterte innstillingene som standard. Se Endringslogg for deployment for hvordan oppgradere til siste versjon.\nTips 2 - Ha et aktivt forhold til hva applikasjonen krever av minne og CPU Altinn kommer med en standard på 50m CPU og 128Mi minne, men hva som faktisk kreves er det jo bare den som utvikler en applikasjon som vet. Hvis det caches mye data, vil det kreve mye minne. Hvis det er tunge operasjoner så vil det kreve mye CPU. De faktiske kravene bør gjenspeiles i Helm Chart hvis de avviker fra standarden.\nTips 3 - Reduser antall instanser i testmiljø Trenger man 2 kjørende instanser i test eller kan man klare seg med 1? Ønsker man å teste hvordan en app oppfører seg med flere instanser så trenger man nødvendigvis 2 eller flere, men ofte så holder det men 1 kjørende instans i test og man tåler litt nedetid ved deploy.\nMerk: Har man gjort de tiltakene man kan, men alikevel har nådd taket på hva clusteret håndterer så er neste steg å øke antallet noder evt. ha kraftigere noder. Ta kontakt med oss i Altinn så ser vi på dette sammen med dere.\n"

	"description": "Guidelines for using Redux in Altinn Studio",
	"content": "Redux is used to manage the states of the applications. The components update the states in the Redux store, instead of keeping state only within the component. This allows components to easily react to state changes from other components.\nRedux Toolkit As of 2021, we have started using Redux Toolkit rather than the traditional Redux setup. This allows us to get rid of a lot of boilerplate code. Read more about Redux Toolkit here.\nIn practice, this affects the setup of actions and reducers. We currently use Redux Toolkit in Altinn Studio, and plan to update the App frontend as well. Redux Toolkit also works well in parallel with the more traditional setup. In App frontend, any new reducers should be set up as slices where possible, using Redux Toolit. New actions can be set up using the createAction method, rather than the existing boilerplate setup.\ncreateAction React more about creating actions here. Actions can also be created automatically within slices. The createAction command is useful for actions that are are not necessarily handled by the reducer.\ncreateSlice Read more about slices here. Slices combine the creation of actions and reducers into one command, thereby reducing the amount of code, as well as making the setup much more readable.\nDispatching actions In the traditional setup, we use an action dispatcher. For App frontend, it is possible to combine f.ex. createAction with existing action dispatchers. Where possible, however, actions should be dispatched using the dispatch function, from the component itself. For class components, this function is provided as a prop from mapStateToProps. For functional components using hooks, we can use const dispatch = useDispatch() where the useDispatch function comes from the react-redux package.\nExamples For examples of Redux Toolkit setup in the code, look at the Studio code, where all actions/reducers/dispatching has been updated to use Redux Toolkit.\nBasic concepts Below is a short descriptions of some of the basic Redux concepts that we use. Note that these are described using the traditional Redux setup and not Redux Toolkit, but the concepts are the same in both cases.\nStore This is where the overall states are stored. Each state is stored here as an object.\nActions Actions are the events that are triggered when a change is made. An action contains the action type, and any metadata needed to complete the action. For example:\nexport interface IUpdateFormData extends Action { field: string; data: any; componentId: string; } export function updateFormData(field: string, data: any, componentId: string): IUpdateFormData { return { type: actionTypes.UPDATE_FORM_DATA, field, data, componentId, }; } In this example, a change in form data can trigger the updateFormData action, which contains an object with the action type, as well as the data/metadata.\nSagas Redux saga is the middleware used to process information before the store is updated (i.e. before the reducer does its work).\nAn example is asyncronous calls to backend APIs to get data, or submit data.\nEach saga defines methods that complete different tasks, connected to actions. These methods are called via listeners that listen to the actions that are being dispatched. There are different sagas for all the different functional areas.\n/** * Define the saga for the UPDATE_FORM_DATA event */ function* updateFormDataSaga(action: ActionType) { try { // fetch some data const relevantData = yield selectRelevantStateObjects(...); ... // process the data const processedData = doRelevantLogic(relevantData); ... // trigger a new action to update the store yield call(updateFormDataSagaFulfilled, processedData, ... ); } catch (err) { yield call(updateFormDataSagaRejected, err); } } /** * Define a listener for the UPDATE_FORM_DATA event */ export function* watchUpdateFormDataSaga(): SagaIterator { yield takeLatest(FormFillerActionTypes.UPDATE_FORM_DATA, updateFormDataSaga); } Reducers Redux reducers are used to update the different states in the store. There is one reduer per state. The reducers listen to the actions that are dispatched when changes are made, and update the state accordingly.\nExample:\nconst initialState: IFormDataState = { formData: {}, error: null, }; const FormDataReducer: Reducer\u0026lt;IFormDataState\u0026gt; = ( state: IFormDataState = initialState, action?: Action, ): IFormDataState =\u0026gt; { if (!action) { return state; } switch (action.type) { case actionTypes.UPDATE_FORM_DATA_FULFILLED: { const { field, data } = action as IUpdateFormDataFulfilled; return Immutable\u0026lt;IFormDataState\u0026gt;(state, { formData: { $setField: { field, data, }, }, }); } case actionTypes.UPDATE_FORM_DATA_REJECTED: { const { error } = action as IUpdateFormDataRejected; return Immutable\u0026lt;IFormDataState\u0026gt;(state, { error: { $set: error, }, }); } default: { return state; } } }; export default FormDataReducer; "

	"description": "Which resources are allocated in a cluster and how?",
	"content": "Primært vil det være CPU og minne som fordeles. Man kan sette minimum (requests) og et tak (limit) for en container. Hvis en pod har flere containere vil kubernetes summere opp disse.\nI Altinn 3 benytter vi som default requests, dvs. minimum for hva en applikasjon vil legge beslag på.\nCPU CPU spesifiseres i CPU enheter, hvor 1 CPU enhet = 1 fysisk CPU kjerne eller 1 virtuell kjerne. Man kan spesifisere fraksjoner og enten spesifisere 0.1 eller 100m (som leses hundre millicores). Vi anbefaler at man benytter m notasjonen og ikke desimal notasjonen slik at man skriver 1m og ikke 0.001 (som er det minste man kan spesifisere).\nSom standard har man 12 kjerner til fordeling i TT02, dvs. 12 000m, gitt dagens oppsett med 6 noder á 2 kjerner. Fra dette må vi trekke fra de systemtekniske containerne som kubernetes selv kjører, det tilsvarer ca. 30% av CPU, da er vi nede i 8000m til fordeling til Altinn 3 applikasjoner.\nFor en app er CPU satt som default til 50m. Dvs. man skal i teorien ha plass til 8000 / 50m = 160 apps på et slikt cluster. Men en app vil som standard kjøres opp i 2 instanser, da har vi brukt 2x50m=100m. I tillegg har hver app en såkalt sidecar container (Linkerd for kryptering/dekryptering) som får 25m. Denne følger instansen og det blir da 2x25=50m. Så en app vil da totalt kreve 150m for 2 instanser. Gitt 8 cpu’er tilgjengelig så får vi 53 apps med dagens oppsett. Dette er veiledende tall, men gir en grei pekepinn. Hvis en app krever mer CPU enn minimum vil den få det gitt at det finnes mer tilgjengelig.\nMinne Minne spesifiseres i byte, og man kan benytte ulike suffixer som Mi, M Ki etc. Altinn 3 spesifiserer dette i Mi som er Mebibyte som er tilnærmet det samme som Megabyte.\nSom standard har vi 48GiB (Gibi Byte) minne tilgjengelig i clusteret totalt, men dette er fordelt med 8GiB på hver av de 6 nodene. Fra dette må vi trekke fra ca. 0.5 - 1GiB som går til systemtekniske containere som kubernetes selv kjører, det tilsvarer ca. 10-20%. Dvs. at vi da har 6 noder x 7Mi = 42GiB (40054Mi) totalt i clusteret og 7GiB (7168Mi) per. Node til fordeling.\nFor en app er minne satt til 128Mi som default. Dvs. man skal i teorien ha plass til 7168Mi / 128Mi = 56 app instanser per node og 336 apps totalt i clusteret hvis vi kun ser på minne. Når vi ser på tallene over minneforbruk så er det et overforbruk av minne, så 256Mi er nok et bedre tall per app. Korrigert for dette så kan vi halvere tallene slik at det blir 24 app instanser per node og 168 app instanser totalt i clusteret.\nHvordan fungerer ressursallokering i clusteret? Når en ny app skal deployes til et Kubernetes cluster vil Kubernetes litt forenklet se på hvor mye minne og CPU det er spurt om som minimum og prøve å finne node som har ledig plass. Hvis den ikke finner en node med ledig plass så vil den se om det er noen av de kjørende applikasjonene som overforbruker ressurser i forhold til hva de har spurt om å kaste ut den eller de som har høyest overforbruk for å gi plass til den nye.\nMerk: Det at Kubernetes vil kaste ut en applikasjon som overforbruker gjør det svært viktig å ha et forhold til hvor mye ressurser man har tilgjengelig, hvor mye hver enkelt app krever og at summen av dette går opp - hvis ikke risikerer man ustabilitet i miljøet.\n"

	"description": "Description of the Runtime Environment for Altinn 3 applications for a service owner.",
	"content": "Altinn 3 applikasjoner for en tjenesteeier kjører i Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) fra Microsoft Azure. Dette er en såkalt Managed Service hvor vi lar Microsoft Azure ta seg av den underliggende driften av Kubernetes clusteret. Altinn står for konfigurering og provisjonering av clusteret, mens tjenesteeier har selv ansvar for utrulling av applikasjonene til clusteret.\nFor detaljert dokumentasjon av hvilke muligheter som finnes må man se på:\nAzure Kubernetes Services Kubernetes, og da spesielt hvordan ressurser administreres - et ansvar som er delt mellom Altinn og tjenesteeier. Alle tjenesteeiere vil ha egne Kubernetes cluster for test og produksjon. Dette sikrer at applikasjoner for en tjenesteeier ikke påvirker applikasjoner for andre tjenesteeiere.\nRessursadministrasjon Selv om man ofte tenker at en skyløsning har ubegrenset kapasitet, så vil også ubegrenset kapasitet gjerne føre til ubegrenset kostnadsbruk. Det er derfor viktig å ha kontroll på hva man forbruker av ressurser, hvor mange applikasjoner man kjører og hvor mye CPU/minne den enkelte applikasjon legger beslag på. Før eller siden vil man gå tom for ressurser (CPU og minne) på clusteret, og det er da viktig å forstå hvilke faktorer som påvirker.\nKomponentene i et cluster Et AKS Cluster kjører på et antall noder (virtuelle maskiner) av en gitt type. Per i dag er dette B2 som har 2 vCPU og 8 GiB minne. Som standard settes det opp minimum 3 noder både i TT02 og produksjon med automatisk skalering opp til 6 noder avhengig av trafikk. Clusteret vil da ha 12 vCPU og 48 GiB minne som da blir den øvre kapasiteten clusteret har til å betjene de applikasjonene som til enhver tid er deployet.\nMerk: Et cluster kan skaleres automatisk opp til 1000 noder, men dette vil også medføre tilsvarende kostnadsøkning. Hva som er det rette \u0026ldquo;taket\u0026rdquo; for den enkelte tjensteeier vil avhenge av antall applikasjoner, hvor mye ressurser disse krever som minimum og trafikken som disse genererer. Ta kontakt med oss i Altinn om dere har behov for mer ressurser enn det som er satt opp som standard.\nFullscreen\nApplikasjoner / Apps Når vi snakker om en Altinn 3 App så snakker vi om den logiske applikasjonen som det bare finnes 1 av. For å sikre at en app hele tiden er oppe så kjører vi som regel med 2 eller flere instanser av applikasjonen. Minne og CPU reservasjoner gjelder per instans.\nDocker Containers En Docker Container, eller bare container, inneholder i vårt tilfelle den kjørende koden for en Altinn 3 App. Men det finnes også andre containere i clusteret som inneholder systemtekniske ting som må kjøre. F. eks. så vil enhver Altinn 3 app container få følge av en Linkerd container som tar seg av kryptering/dekryptering av trafikk inn og ut av Altinn 3 applikasjonen.\nPods En pod er den minste kjørbare enheten i et kubernetes cluster og er det vi allokerer ressurser til. En pod kan bestå av en eller flere containere. En Altinn 3 applikasjon vil typisk bestå av en app container og en såkalt sidecar container som kjører Linkerd. Linkerd er den komponenten som tar seg av kryptering/dekryptering av kommunikasjon mellom pods i et cluster. Grunnen til at vi nevner denne er at denne også vil kreve minne og CPU ressurser.\nDeployments En deployment styrer levetiden til en applikasjon, hvor mange instanser den skal ha samt allokering av minne og CPU. I Altinn 3 spesifiseres dette ved hjelp av såkalte Helm charts,. Dette kan sees på som en innpakking av en applikasjon med fornuftige standard verdier, men standard konfigurasjonen kan overstyres.\nMerk: Noe av ressursene i et Kubernetes cluster vil gå med til systemtekniske prosesser både fra Kubernetes selv og fra Altinn infrastrukturen, så ikke alle ressurser i et cluster vil være tilgjengelig til fordeling til apps.\nPractical tips for resource allocation\rResource Allocation\rWhich resources are allocated in a cluster and how?\n"

Texts can be from common libraries, the data model or manually added by developers.\nThe text resources are available whne you edit UI components in the schema via Altinn Studio, and they are shown to the end user when the form is loaded in a browser.\nTexts are stored in JSON-format and one file per language. The filename format for texts should be resource.[language].json f.ex: resource.nb.json.\nFormatting of texts All texts can be formatted with markdown. Below you can see the most commonly used syntax.\nA more thorough explanation of the markdown syntax can be found here: Markdown Cheatsheet.\nBold and italic texts Its very easy to make words or sentences bold or italic with markdown.\nThis is in _italic_ using underscores.

Headings # This is a big heading (H1) ## This is a smaller heading (H2) ### An even smaller heading (H3) #### A tiny heading (H4) Add and change texts in an application You have two options when you want to modify texts in an application, either via Altinn Studio, changing it directly in the repository.\nUsing Altinn Studio In the top navigation bar in Altinn Studio, selec Languages to be able to edit texts. An overview of the texts that already exists in the application are listed.\nOn this page you can edit the existing texts and add new ones. New texts can be added by clikcing the New text button, and fill in the fields. The key needs to be unique.\nSave the changes in the texts by clicking Save texts.\nChanging texts directly in the repository This is the recommended way to update texts if there are many changes you want to make. The texts can be changed directly in the repository, or by cloning the repository and using your preferred text editor.\nThe texts are stored in App/config/texts\nVariables in texts Variables in texts can be included by following the syntax below. It is important that the order of the variables in the variables array is the same order as the parameters in the text.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;good.text.id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hello, {0}!

Data can be fetched from fields regardless if they are visible or not. If the user changes data in a field referenced in a variable, the text will be updated when the user stops typing in the field. Application Settings\nBy defining applicationSettings as the data source you can fetch values from a specific section in appsettings.{environment}.json files with the key FrontEndSettings. This is a dynamic list you can extend without making changes to the code. This makes it possible to have different values in different environments. Be aware of the difference on first letter casing in the keys FrontEndSettings and applicationSettings. \u0026#34;FrontEndSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;HomeBaseUrl\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://www.testdirektoratet.no\u0026#34; }, Instance This datasource is based on the instance and will contain some values from the active instance. We cannot access the entire instance object. The list of available properties is currently: instanceOwnerPartyId inneholder avgiver sin party id. instanceId inneholder id\u0026rsquo;en til den aktive instansen. appId inneholder id\u0026rsquo;en til appen instansen er knyttet til. Complete example: { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;common.submitinfo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;You are submitting for: {0} with organisation number: {1}. The organisations party id is {2}. [Link to our page]({3}).\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variables\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;skattepliktig.organisasjonsnavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.default\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;skattepliktig.organisasjonsnummer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.default\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;instanceOwnerPartyId\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;instanceContext\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;homeBaseUrl\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;applicationSettings\u0026#34; } ] } Variables in text - repeating groups To make variables in text work with repeating groups, you need to make a slight modification to the example above.\nThis is achieved by adding [{0}] after the repeating groups when you specify a field in the data model in the key.parameter Example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;common.submitinfo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;You are submitting for: {0} with organisation number: {1}.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variables\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;skattepliktig[{0}].organisasjonsnavn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.default\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;skattepliktig[{0}].organisasjonsnummer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.default\u0026#34; } ] } It is possible to combine variables from fields in repeating groups with variables from fields that are not in repeating groups. It is not recommended to combine variables from fields in different repeating groups, unless you are sure that the order of the items in the groups will be identical.\nAdding help texts Help texts are short texts that gives a concrete description of what the end user is expected to fill in the field which the help text is connected to.\nThe keys that define the help texts are defined in FormLayout.json. In the repository this file is located in App/ui/.\nBelow is an example of a FormLayout.json without help texts.\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;616071dc-90b1-4ce5-8d18-492844828a41\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Header\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentType\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appName\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {} }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;08d707a9-2475-4d23-bf76-f209fb434ec2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TextArea\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentType\u0026#34;: 7, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tilleggsopplysninger.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tilleggsopplysninger.desc\u0026#34;, }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;omsetningsoppgaverTilleggsopplysninger.value\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bd6589b6-e2ab-49ba-b39a-dd3f8b63e5de\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentType\u0026#34;: 9, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Send inn\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;textResourceId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Standard.Button.Button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Standard\u0026#34; } ] } } If you want to add help texts to any of these components you have to\nAdd the help text in the resource file as described here. Open the FormLayout.json-file. Add the binding to the new help text with the key \u0026quot;help\u0026quot; and value equal the newly added text resource. This is how the file looks after adding help texts:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;616071dc-90b1-4ce5-8d18-492844828a41\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Header\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentType\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appName\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {} }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;08d707a9-2475-4d23-bf76-f209fb434ec2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TextArea\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentType\u0026#34;: 7, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tilleggsopplysninger.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tilleggsopplysninger.desc\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;help\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tilleggsopplysninger.help\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;omsetningsoppgaverTilleggsopplysninger.value\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;bd6589b6-e2ab-49ba-b39a-dd3f8b63e5de\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;componentType\u0026#34;: 9, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Send inn\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;textResourceId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Standard.Button.Button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Standard\u0026#34; } ] } } Change application title When you create an application you have a textresource witht he label appName. This it the title of the application that will be displayed in several places in our solution, f.ex when an end user is filling out a form and when elements are displayed in the messagebox in altinn.no.\nThe title of the application is located in two places in the application repository:\nIn the textresource with the key appName. In applicationmetadata.json in the title property. This file is located at App/config/. App owners are encouraged to add titles in bokmål, nynorsk and english. If a title is missing in the textresources the repository name will be used as a fallback, and may be shown to the end user.\nIf you change appName from an IDE (f.ex Visual Studio Code), it is important to also update the title in applicationmetadata.json. If the title is changed from Altinn Studio on the \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; page or \u0026ldquo;languages\u0026rdquo; page, the applicationmetadata.json file is updated automatically.\nApplication title configuration example In App/config/applicationmetadata.json:\n\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Automatisk deploy applikasjonen\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Automatisk deploy applikasjonen\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Auto deploy application\u0026#34; }, In App/config/texts/resource.nb.json:\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Automatisk deploy applikasjonen\u0026#34; }, . . . ] } In App/config/texts/resource.nn.json:\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Automatisk deploy applikasjonen\u0026#34; }, . . . ] } I App/config/texts/resource.en.json:\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Auto deploy application\u0026#34; }, . . . ] } Change app owner text The application name and app owner is displayed at the top in the application.\nThe application owner is fetched by default from the texts defined in altinn-orgs.json. If you want to change this name, you can add the key appOwner in the text resources. This wil override the value coming from CDN.\nEksempel:\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;appOwner\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Test Ministry\u0026#34; }, . . . ] } Change texts on the archive receipt page The texts on the receipt page can be overridden by the application by specifying the texts in the applications config/texts/resource.xx.json file.\nOverriding any text in the receipt will have an effect on any receipt for the given application.\rThis means that forms that are already submitted will also get the updated texts on the receipt page. The generated PDF will not be affected by this.\rYou can also use markdown and variables in the receipt. Currently you can only fetch variables from Instance (See Data Sources for details)\nThese are the text id\u0026rsquo;s that can be used to override the default platform texts:\nreceipt_platform.attachments receipt_platform.date_sent receipt_platform.helper_text receipt_platform.is_sent receipt_platform.receipt receipt_platform.receiver receipt_platform.reference_number receipt_platform.sender receipt_platform.sent_content For example if you want to change the help text, you can add this to the config/texts/resource.en.json file in your application:\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;en\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;receipt_platform.helper_text\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My custom help text\u0026#34; } ] } The image below shows which key controls which text in the UI\nNote: These text changes will not be visible in your local test environment, they will only be visible in the test environment TT02. To see the changes you must navigate from the Archive and press the \u0026ldquo;See submitted form\u0026rdquo;. As of now the modified text will not be used while submitting your form.\nTranslation of texts\rHow to translate texts in the application.\n"

The instance document is a way for Altinn and external parties to track the state of one specific data exchange. How long an instance lives and how many interactions there are between the application owner and user will vary from one app to another. Advanced apps will have their own documentation.\nbasePath\n{org}/{appname}/instances Get instance Endpoint for downloading the instance metadata document for a specific instance. The app API does not have an endpoint for listing instances. The Storage API in the Platform has a query endpoint that can be used for this purpose.\nUse this endpoint for instances that are active, and the owner party id and instance guid for the instance are known. External systems that work with an instance over multiple sessions might want to keep these values (or full URL) stored on their end to limit the need to query this information multiple times.\nGET {basePath}/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid} Get active instances Endpoint for listing active instances for an instance owner.\nThis endpoint can be used to determine if a new instance of an app should be created or if continuation on an existing instance would be more feasible. Note that the object returned is a simplified instance object and that LastChangedBy contains the name of the latest active entity rather than an id number.\n[ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337/bffd2c17-9d93-49f4-b504-3d0ece2402c7\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChanged\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-09-23T10:19:43\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChangedBy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Sophie Salt\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;instanceId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1337/agfd2c17-4d93-49f4-b504-3d0ece2402d8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChanged\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-07-11T22:14:02\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastChangedBy\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Sophie Salt\u0026#34; } ] GET {basePath}/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/active Create instance Altinn assigns a unique identifier to all users that wish to report data. We call this id instanceOwner.partyId. If you do not know this, you should provide the official identity number, e.g national identification number for persons or organisation number for organisations, and in some case user name. This should be provided as part of the payload to the creation request. Altinn will look up this identifier and replace it with the instanceOwner.partyId. The official identity number will be stored in the instance metadata.\nData elements can be provided as part of the creation request, but can also be uploaded at a later time.\nThe client specifies the instance owner and may set a number of the metadata fields of the instance by attaching the following form:\n{ \u0026#34;appId\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;org/app\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instanceOwner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;personNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12247918309\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organisationNumber\u0026#34;: null }, \u0026#34;dueBefore\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2019-06-01T12:00:00Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;visibleAfter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2019-05-20T00:00:00Z\u0026#34; } Notice that all dates must be expressed in Utc (Zulu) time zone and represented according to ISO 8601!\nData elements (files) can be attached to the initial request as a multipart/form-data or as attachments. The name of the parts must correspond to element types defined in the application metadata.\nPOST {basePath} A multipart/formdata should contain the instance json document and the data element files of the instance. The first part should be instance which contains the json template to create an instance from.\nThe subsequent parts must have a name that correspond to the element types defined in application metadata. They may have a filename. Hence the model1 and certificate names correspond to data types defined in the application metadata. If additional data elements are required they must be defined in the application metadata.\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=\u0026#34;abcdefg\u0026#34; --abcdefg Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026#34;instance\u0026#34; { ... } --abcdefg Content-Type: application/xml Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026#34;model1\u0026#34; \u0026lt;xml\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/xml\u0026gt; --abcdefg Content-Type: application/pdf Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026#34;certificate\u0026#34;; filename=certificate.pdf %PDF-1.4 %Óëéá 1 0 obj ... --abcdefg-- This call will return the instance metadata document that was created.\nSimplified instansiation For scenarios where the multipart is not required there is a new API that is simpler. It supports both key-value prefilling and copying data from an archived instance.\nThe endpoint is available at\nPOST {basePath}/create Required body differs for the two features, and examples are available below.\nInstantiation with key-value prefill { \u0026#34;instanceOwner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;personNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12247918309\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organisationNumber\u0026#34;: null }, \u0026#34;prefill\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;navnGarantist\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;Ole Hansen\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dueBefore\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2019-06-01T12:00:00Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;visibleAfter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2019-05-20T00:00:00Z\u0026#34; } Instantiation from archived instance { \u0026#34;instanceOwner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;partyId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;50002108\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;personNumber\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;organisationNumber\u0026#34;: null }, \u0026#34;sourceInstanceId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;50002108/049622b8-ea06-40f6-9f1b-26ceb7566232\u0026#34; } Update sub status The instance sub status is used to give an end user further details about the state of their instance. Currently, only application owner is allowed to update substatus for an instance. Include the new substatus in the body of the requests as a json.\nPUT {basePath}/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid}/substatus Request body\n{ \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Beskrivelse i klarteskst\u0026#34; } The values can be referencing text resource names from the language files or be regular text.\nComplete instance Endpoint used by application owner to mark an instance as completed. Technically this only means that the instance is no longer needed by the application owner.\nAltinn will permanently delete an instance and all the data, if both application owner and a user with the necessary rights indicate on the instance that they no longer have a need for it.\nPOST {basePath}/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid}/complete The request does not use the request body for anything even though it is a POST request.\nDelete instance Endpoint for marking an instance as deleted. This can be used by both application owner and user to delete an instance. The endpoint has an optional parameter called hard that can be used to indicate the type of delete that is wanted. Setting the parameter to false or simply omitting it, will move the instance to a recycle bin. Hard delete means that the instance will be unrecoverable.\nInstances that where active might be permanently deleted by Altinn within a few days. Archived instances will be permanently deleted if both application owner and a user with the necessary rights indicate on the instance that they no longer have a need for it.\nDELETE {basePath}/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid}?hard=true The endpoint does not use the request body for anything.\nThere are no Application API endpoint for recovering instances in the recycle bin.\n"

	"content": "What is a widget? A widget is a complex component, consisting of one or more simple form components - the form components available to use in Altinn Studio as of today. A widget is a tool in Altinn Studio that makes it easier to create and reuse layouts.\nHow to use widgets Widgets are available in the menu to the left in the form editor in Altinn Studio. It can be dragged into the form page in the same way as other form components. When a widget is dragged into the form in Altinn Studio, the form components that are defined as part of the widget are added to the layout, together with default setup such as connection to data model, texts, etc. When a widget is dragged into the form, you will be able to see the form components it consists of. These can be edited normally in the form editor. If there are texts defined for the widget, these are added to the resource files automatically.\nExample: Message widget Available widgets Default widgets Eventually we will offer a collection of various widgets, these will appear automatically in the menu to the left in the form editor in Altinn Studio. The list is updated as new widgets are added. As of today the following widgets are available:\nName Description Screenshot Message Contains the components that make up a standard message:\ntitle\nmessage text\nfile attachment\nnavigation button\nThe texts are set up with reference to fields in the standard message data model. See here for more info on messages. Custom widgets In addition to default widgets that automatically appear in Altinn Studio, it is also possible to define custom widgets. A widget consists of three parts:\nComponents: This is a list of all the components that should be included, including the definition of these components. This is set up in the same way as in the layout files, you can for example copy components directly from a layout file. Display name: This is the text that is displayed in Altinn Studio, in the menu where the widget is placed. Text resources: This is optional, and is a list of text resources of the languages you want to incorporate. This is useful if the components e.g. should have some default texts to use. See setup for message widget for a concrete example. There is also a widget template that can be downloaded to get started.\n"

The rules that are defined in this file is described below.\nThe aforementioned rules can be changed in policy.xml which lies in App/config/authorization in the application repository. Details about configuring the policy file can be found [here](/technology/architecture/components/application/solution/altinn-studio/designer/pap/xacmlpolicy/ You can also find a good amount of example rules here.\nPlease note that changes to the policy file is at your own risk,\rand that it is recommended to always delegate read permissions to entities with writing permissions.\rPermissions for roles The rules that give the CEO (DAGL) or accountant assistant (REGNA) permissions to instantiate, write read and delete instances of the application are defined in the policy file.\nA complete list of role types can be found here.\nPermissions for the application owner The application owner (organization) has rights to instantiate, write and read instances of the application. They also have permissions to mark instances as completed.\nRequired authentication level Reqired authentication level is set to 2 by default. This is done as an obligation in the XACML Policy file.\nIf the required authentication level is set to 4 you have to define that the service owner can interact with it through level 3 authentification for Maskinporten. This is because Maskinporten is defined as level 3. See the rule library for examples.

They should not have a direct connection to the store, and should not know anything about the store.\nSagas All logic used in a saga should be an exported function in the utils-folder. This is decided since we need to split up the logic from the fetching of data, so we have a more testable codebase. The saga only fetches data from the state, and sends the appropriate data to utils-functions.\nFolder Structure This is the best practice for folder structure in applications.

	"description": "The app API to work with the data elements associated with an instance.",
	"content": "Overview A data element consist of two parts: its metadata document and the actual data blob. This API work primarily with the blob while keeping the metadata document updated.\nbasePath\n{org}/{appname}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceGuid}/data Get data Endpoint for downloading the data blob.\nGET basePath/{dataGuid} Accept: application/{xml/json} The response will depend on the type of blob. There are currently 2 primary types: form data based on a model and attachments. An Accept header in a request will be considered only when the requested data element is connected to a data model. The header is then used to pick a serializer for the data.\nResponse with form data A response with form data will either be a json or xml serialized version of the data model depending on the Accept header in the request. The value application/xml will result in an XML document and the value application/json will result inn a JSON document.\nResponse with attachment A response with a file attachment will be a file stream. Content-Type will be the same as the original value given when the file was uploaded. The same is true for the file name.\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=cute_cat.png; filename*=UTF-8\u0026#39;\u0026#39;cute_cat.png Content-Length: 16994 Content-Type: image/png Upload data Endpoint for uploading a new data element on a specific instance.\nPOST basePath?dataType={data type name} The dataType parameter is required and should reference one of the data types defined on the application. Data types with an appLogic property are linked to a form and will have data validation and calculation rules associated with them. Data types without an appLogic property will be handeled as an attachment and streamed directly to storage.\nRequest Content-Type is handled a little differently between the two cases:\nIf a request is uploading form data, the Content-Type is used by Altinn to deserialize the request into a strongly typed object. A request must either be application/json or application/xml. No other Content-Types are supported. Content-Type is not validated against allowed Content-Types on the data type. If a request is uploading an attachment, the validation of Content-Type will depend on the rules of the data type. If the data type has no Content-Type requirements, there will be no validation and the request can contain any Content-Type. If the data type has Content-Type requirements, there is a new set of checks. The request Content-Type must either be application/octet-stream or match the MIME type of the file being uploaded. Altinn will perform a mapping from file extension to MIME type before comparing with Content-Type. As an example we can see that .xml will map to text/xml and not application/xml. If the data type allow Content-Type application/octet-stream no further validation is performed. If not, the identified MIME type must match one of the allowed Content-Types on the data type.

	"description": "Guidelines for exception handling in backend logic.",
	"content": "Exception Handling Exception handling is the act of catching an exception with the intention of handling the situation so that normal execution flow can continue. It should not be used as any part of an expected execution flow. It should also be avoided if the situation continue to be unrecoverable.\n.Net core provides a default middleware UseExceptionHandler that will catch exceptions and log them. You can read more about this here. This is the preferred mechanism when it comes to dealing with errors the application logic is unable to handle elegantly on its own. The middleware should be configured to generate a response that is appropriate for the running environment.\nExceptions that can be handled by the application logic should be handled as soon and as specific as possible. The following example is found in the platform Storage application. More specifically the DataController.GetDataElementAsync method.\nActionResult errorMessage; try { DataElement dataElement = await _dataRepository.Read(instanceGuid, dataGuid); return (dataElement, null); } catch (DocumentClientException dce) { if (dce.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.NotFound) { errorMessage = NotFound($\u0026#34;Unable to find any data element with id: {dataGuid}.\u0026#34;); } else { throw; } } In this example the try..catch is interested only in the DocumentClientException, and on top of that only when the StatusCode is NotFound. All other exceptions and exception reasons are ignored and will end up in the .Net Core middleware.\nAPI Response Exceptions that are handled by application logic can result in almost any response. The outcome will depend on the type of exception and how it is handled:\n200 - Ok - The original request is considered successfully processed. 400 - BadRequest - The exception was caused by a faulty request. In this case it is preferred that the application logic does active validation instead of needing to deal with an exception. 401 - Unauthorized - Similar to BadRequest, but logic is associated with authentication. 403 - Forbidden - Similar to BadRequest, but logic is associated with authorization. 404 - NotFound - The requested resource does not exist. By limiting the usage of status codes, we can ease the handling of different status codes at client side. Application logic should (ideally) never produce a 500 response. Exceptions that are not handled by application logic, but the default middleware will always result in a response with status code 500.\nMiddleware configuration Handling of unrecoverable errors should be done by the built in middleware mentioned previously. The configuration should be different between production environments and other environments. In development and staging environments the middleware should allow detailed exception information to be exposed by the API.\nConfiguration of the middleware is done in the Startup.Configure method. This is an example from the platform Storage application:\nif (env.IsDevelopment() || env.IsStaging()) { app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage(); } else { app.UseExceptionHandler(\u0026#34;/storage/api/v1/error\u0026#34;); } This configuration requires an ErrorController that can handle the server side redirect performed by the middleware. The following code sample is a stipped version of the ErrorController in the platform Storage application:\n[ApiController] [ApiExplorerSettings(IgnoreApi = true)] [AllowAnonymous] [Route(\u0026#34;storage/api/v1\u0026#34;)] public class ErrorController : ControllerBase { [Route(\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;)] public IActionResult Error() =\u0026gt; Problem(); } "

	"content": "\rThis page is a work-in-progress. Because we do not have details on how potential errors should be shown to the users, this is only a general overview currently. More details will be added once we have a functional understanding of how users should experience errors. React components Error boundaries Error boundaries are React\u0026rsquo;s official way of handling errors that occur in a component. This functionality is available from React 16. Using this allows a component to fail without unmounting the whole application, and allows us to control how the user is exposed to unexpected errors.\nSee the official React documentation or this official blog post for more information about error boundaries and how to implement them.\nWe need a generic error boundary component that can be configured and reused for all of the sub-applications. Each sub-application should be wrapped in this error boundary component. This will allow the main applications (service-development and dashboard) to keep functioning even though any sub-applications throw an error.\nIn addition we should have a generic \u0026ldquo;something went wrong\u0026rdquo; error boundary for the main applications.\nWithin the sub-applications, it may be beneficial to implement error boundaries around key components. This will typically be relevant for components that act as containers for other components. An example could be the preview-component in the UI-editor, which shows the working surface of the forms designer.\nEvent handlers Error boundaries do not catch errors that occur within event handlers, as mentioned in the official React documentation. Thus, any direct API calls from within an event handler in a React component should be wrapped in a try/catch block.\nOptional props Any use of props that have been defined as optional should be done together with a null/undefined-check, to make sure that the prop is actually available.\nRedux Actions All actions should have sibling actions for success and error. See naming conventions for actions. The success action is triggered when everything is ok, while the error action is triggered if something goes wrong.\nSagas If a saga needs to make an API call (or uses logic/utils that make API calls), this should be wrapped in a try/catch block. If an error occurs, this should be logged and the corresponding error action should be triggered. If no error occurs then the corresponding success action should be triggered. See here for more information on actions and sagas.\nReducers If an error handling action is triggered, the reducer should update the corresponding error object in the state to reflect that an error has occured.\nLogging errors We need to decide if all errors should be logged on the server or not. If all front-end errors should be logged on the server, we need to create an API we can call from the front-end to to the logging. All errors that are caught should be logged to the console using console.error.\n"

Avaliable query paramters include:\nprocess.currentTask (string)\nSearch for instances at a specific step in its process. process.isComplete (bool)\nSearch for instances where the process is completed. process.endEvent (string)\nDeprecated. The parameter doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any code associated with it. process.ended (datetime)\nFilter instances based on ended date. instanceOwner.partyId (int)\nFilter instances based on the instance owner party id. lastChanged (datetime)\nFilter instances based on the last time they where worked on. created (datetime)\nFilter instances based on when they where initially created. visibleAfter (datetime)\nFilter instances based on when they became visible. dueBefore (datetime)\nFilter instances based on their due date. excludeConfirmedBy (string)\nExclude instances already confirmed by a specific stakeholder. Usually the short name of an application owner. isArchived (bool) Filter instances based on whether they are archived. isSoftDeleted (bool) Filter instances based on whether they are soft deleted. isHardDeleted (bool) Filter instances based on whether they are hard deleted. Note that hard deleted instances are only included if an application owner retrieves instances, and the results may include deleted drafts. Some examples:\nGet all instances of application org/app, that is at process task with id Task_2 (which is Submit, see process definition), and has last changed date greater than 2019-05-01.\nGET {storagePath}/instances?appId=org/app\u0026amp;process.currentTask=Task_2\u0026amp;lastChanged=gt:2019-05-01 Get all instances of all applications of a given application owner org that has ended date greater than 2020-03-10.\nGET {storagePath}/instances?org=org\u0026amp;process.ended=gt:2020-03-10 Get all instances of all applications of a given application owner org that has not already been confirmed completed by org.\nGET {storagePath}/instances?org=org\u0026amp;excludeConfirmedBy=org Get all instances of an application that are at a specific process task e.g. Task_1.\nGET {storagePath}/instances?appId={org}/{app}\u0026amp;process.currentTask={taskId} On query parameters specifying date time you can use the following operators:\ngt: - greater than gte: - greater than or equal to lt: - less than lte: - less than or equal to eq: - equal (can also be blank) They can be combined to define a range:\ndueBefore=gt:2019-02\u0026amp;dueBefore=lt:2019-03-01 The query returns a result object (page) which includes a collection of instances that matched the query. 100 instances is returned by default. Use size to get more or less instances per page. To get to the next page you have to use the continuationToken present in the next link.\nThe instances endpoint returns a query result object with information about how many total hits totalHits that the query matched and how many objects returned count.\nThe endpoint supports application/json.\nAccept: application/json { \u0026#34;totalHits\u0026#34;: 234, \u0026#34;count\u0026#34;: 50, \u0026#34;self\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{storagePath}/instances?appId=org/app\u0026amp;size=50\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;next\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{storagePath}/instances?appId=org/app\u0026amp;size=50\u0026amp;continuationToken=%257b%2522token%2522%253a%2522%252bRID%...\u0026#34; \u0026#34;instances\u0026#34;: [ {...}, {...}, ... ] } } "

	"content": "\rThis page is a work-in-progress. Because we do not have details on how potential errors should be shown to the users, this is only a general overview currently. More details will be added once we have a functional understanding of how users should experience errors. Logging .Net core provides a standard logging framework that can be used to log exceptions or events to a desired logging provider (console, eventlog, azure app service, application insights). You can read more about logging in asp.net core from here.\nWhat to log? Context is very important to any warning message or error that is logged. Without context, it can be difficult to relate applicaiton failures to logs. So it is important to include the following details in the log\nWhere in the code did the application fail? Who was using the system when it failed? What was the system doing when it failed? Specify a log level that can be used to filter logs when needed Where do we log? The idea is to send the logs to the console and collect them using Application Insights (Note: Application Insights involves data limitation and costs vary based on needs). It is also possible to log to different log providers by configuring it in the config file. F.ex It is possible log only error and warning message to appinsights and information logs to console.\nThird Party Logging Frameworks There are a bunch of third party logging frameworks available for .net core. Serilog is one of them and Altinn Studio will use it to log. There are many advantages of using serilog\nIt\u0026rsquo;s open source Allows logging to many sinks like slack, azure, etc. It has support for logging to files (Microsfot basic logging doesn\u0026rsquo;t have support for logging in file at this point) It allows to define a custom message template for logging. Provides prebuilt enrichers through nuget. These add more value and information to the log events. This can be used to filter events in Application Insights. Step one - Init logger in Program.cs public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =\u0026gt; WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args) .ConfigureLogging((hostingContext, logging) =\u0026gt; { logging.ClearProviders(); Serilog.ILogger logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .WriteTo.Console() .CreateLogger(); logging.AddProvider(new SerilogLoggerProvider(logger)); }); Step two - inject logger where it is needed private ILogger logger; public ApplicationsController( IApplicationRepository repository, ILogger logger) { this.logger = logger; this.repository = repository; } Step three - log error _logger.LogError(exception, \u0026#34;Unable to process request...\u0026#34;); "

After issues with creating SSL/TLS certificates for nginx we we have written a guide for future developers to follow when creating SSL/TLS certificate secrets in kubernetes and mounting them to the nginx pods.\nDownload .pfx file At the moment of writing this guide, we store our *.altinn.studio certificate in azure keyvault and you will need access to download it from that vault. When you have downloaded the .pfx file, you can start extracting the CA certificate bundles, private key and the certificate.\nExtracting the values from the pfx file With openssl installed and in path, open a terminal and type the command\nExtracting the private key $ openssl pkcs12 -in \u0026lt;filename.pfx\u0026gt; -nocerts -nodes -out star.altinn.studio.key Extracting the certificate $ openssl pkcs12 -in \u0026lt;filename.pfx\u0026gt; -clcerts -nokeys -out star.altinn.studio.cert Extracting the CA certificates $ openssl pkcs12 -in \u0026lt;filename.pfx\u0026gt; -cacerts -nokeys -chain -out star.altinn.studio.ca.cert Assembling a SSL/TLS bundle After extracting all the certificate and keys, you will have 3 new files in the same directory that you have the .pfx file. These files will be:\nstar.altinn.studio.key star.altinn.studio.crt star.altinn.studio.ca.crt Now you can start assembling an SSL/TLS certificate bundle.\nIn the file star.altinn.studio.ca.crt you will have 2 certificate, one intermediate and a root certificate. The root certificate doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be in the SSL/TLS bundle, so copy the second certificate block (including the -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----END CERTIFICATE-----) in this file and paste it at the bottom in star.altinn.studio.crt-file.\nUsing the SSL/TLS values in the kubernetes pod Kubernetes encodes secrets with base64, so you will need to encode the contents of star.altinn.studio.cert and star.altinn.studio.key files. And create a secret in the kubernetes cluster. The secret can be defined like this:\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: ssl-cert type: Opaque data: star.altinn.studio.cert: \u0026lt;BASE 64 ENCODED SSL/TLS-BUNDLE\u0026gt; star.altinn.studio.key: \u0026lt;BASE 64 ENCODED PRIVATE KEY\u0026gt; The names under data will be the filenames mounted on the kubernetes pods (these will have to match with the filenames defined in the nginx.conf config file, which is a configmap).\nnginx.conf:\n...\rserver {\rlisten 443 ssl http2;\rssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;\rssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;\rssl_ciphers ECDH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+3DES:!ADH:!AECDH:!MD5;\rssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/altinn_studio/star.altinn.studio.cert;\rssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/altinn_studio/star.altinn.studio.key;\rssl_stapling on;\rssl_stapling_verify on;\rssl_trusted_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/altinn_studio/star.altinn.studio.cert;\rssl_session_cache shared:SSL/TLS:40m;\rssl_session_timeout 4h;\rssl_session_tickets on;\r...\r} The path of where the certificates are mounted is described in the helm deployment.

There is a pull request and master pipeline for each component.\nThe pull request pipeline builds a dockerimage and is triggered whenever a pull request is created or updated that modifies code related to the component.\nThe master pipeline builds a docker image and pushes it to Azure Container Registry. The pipeline is triggered whenever new code is merged into the master branch that modifies code related to the component.\nThe pull request pipeline for the .net app template does not build a docker image, but simply ensures that it is possible to build the app template used by Altinn Studio.\nPipelines follow this naming standard: [component]-(master/pull-request).\ncode-analysis Each component in the solution has their own analysis pipeline. The pipeline runs unit and integration tests and triggers a sonar cloud analysis of the code.\nPipelines follow this naming standard: [component]-analysis-[langugage].\nload-test The load-test pipelines are administered by the load-testing team. The pipelines run k6 tests aimed at YT01.\ntest There are automated tests that are aimed at our running solutions and that can be run in any environment.\nThe pipelines in this project have varying triggers. Some are on a schedule and regularily run in one or all of our environments. Others are triggered when a new release is deployed to an environment.\napps-and-platform-postman trigger: nightly schedule environment: at22 details: tests platform and app APIs studio-cypress trigger: final task in release pipeline for Designer environment: all details: runs cypress test in Altinn Studio to validate most common functionality. apps-k6 trigger: N/A environment: N/A details: k6 tests to verify Altinn Apps behavior platform-k6 trigger: final task in release pipeline for relevant platform components. environment: all except YT01. details: k6 tests to verify Altinn Platform functionality. Release Pipelines See all release pipelines here.\nOur release pipelines are set up with multiple stages. This allows for different policies related to deploy and varying triggers.\nCommon for all release pipelines is that they rely on an artifact containing the helm chart which is packed in Azure Studio Ops project.\nDeploy to TT02 or production requires approval from a team member. Weekly releases are scheduled for these environments.\nHOWTO Setting a variable as secret Marking a variable is secret is straight forward. Navigate to the pipeline variables.\nAll that is needed in order for a variable to be secured in the pipeline is click on the lock icon at the right hand side.\nDisable sharing of secrets on github forks Disabling of secret sharing on repo forks are done by navigating from the pipeline to Triggers and selecting the github integration under \u0026ldquo;Pull Request Validation\u0026rdquo;. Here you can disable secret sharing by disabling the build on forks.\n"

To be able to do requests against these APIs the cookies have to be included in the HTTP request, and configured in postman. The cookies can be found in the following way:\nIn your browser login to dev.altinn.studio/altin.studio/altinn3.no depending on what environment you are targeting Notice that the cookies AltinnStudioDesigner, AltinnStudioRuntime and i_like_gitea (among others) has been saved for the domain name you have logged in to. For Chrome cookies can be found under settings -\u0026gt; advanced -\u0026gt; cookies -\u0026gt; see all. The two cookies AltinnStudioDesigner and AltinnStudioRuntime works as auth against the Designer and APP API respectively, so if you are targeting a Designer API you should include the AltinnStudioDesigner cookie, along with the i_like_gitea cookie, and if you are targeting a runtime API the AltinnStudioRuntime cookie should be included. Cookies are easily added to the postman requests under the slightly hidden cookies setting, see:\nSet up postman tests Download and install postman native app. Import the files from src/test/Postman/Collection to the collections area in Postman. Import the environment .json file from src/test/Postman to the environments area in Postman. How to write postman tests Find the area/collection where the new test has to be added. Add a new request of type GET/POST/PUT/DELETE under the right folder. Provide the endpoint, input for the request. Make sure the variable values are accessed from environments file. Write the tests as a javascript code in the \u0026rsquo;tests\u0026rsquo; section of a request. More about test scrips Tests should have one test to verify valid response code and another test to validate the content of the response. Information about the postman collections Collections folder include postman collections for Platform API, Storage API, APP API. All collection uses altinn3.postman_environment as an environment file. One has to fill in the values (testdata) in the environment file based on the environment under test. The collections has steps that would authenticate an user and set appropriate cookies. Run Postman tests against a test environment.

This is a proposed api which most likely is going to change.\rREST REST is an architectural style for designing loosely coupled applications over HTTP which was coined by Rob Fielding in 2000. We will define services according to REST.\nREST APIs should start with /api so that we with ease can differentiate between an rest api call and a ux-application call.\nREST APIs should start with a short word to indicate the logical domain or group of apis.\nREST APIs should be versioned, with semantic versioning: v1 major (incompatible API changes), v1.1 minor (add backwards-compatible functionality), and v1.1.1 patch (bugfix). We should strive to make REST APIs backwards compatible, hence clients should not break if we add a new parameter.\nREST APIs paths should be in lower case letters. Query parameter names should be lowerCamelCase.\nREST APIs should be resource oriented. A resources is a thing that the client and server knows about. The API provides methods to find, create, update, delete or manipulate a resource object. A resource in a system should have only one logical URI, which should provide a way to fetch related or additional data about the resource.\nREST APIs specifications should be public awailable as OpenApi 3.0 (swagger).\n/api/{domain}/{version}/{resource} Example:\nCreate a new instance resource. Post to instances with query params that identifies the application and the instance owner. This call should return identifier of the new instance resource or the json of the instance resource itself.\n/api/storage/v1/instances?applicationId=KNS-sailor\u0026amp;instanceOwnerId=1024 GET one instance or PUT to to this url to update the instance.\n/api/storage/v1/instances/23f1faab-bdb3-4cba-aed2-d515e1be6db8 Get (query) all instances that is instance owner has\n/api/storage/v1/instances\u0026amp;instanceOwnerId={instanceOwnerId}[\u0026amp;since=2017-01-01] "

Already in this phase, we identify changes that need special security considerations. Typical this is done as part of grooming. We mark our security-related features and bugs to a specific label. Details of security-related issues are in many cases kept out of GitHub.\nCode phase During the development of a feature, we have several processes and tools to help us creating secure code.\nDevelopment checklists We have a development checklist that ensures that developers and reviewers consider the different security aspects.\nSee checklist.\nIDE and tools We use both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. Those provide us with tools for static code analysis.\nStyleCop analyzes C# source code to enforce a set of style and consistency rules. See project Code Analysis verifies the code after a ruleset defined by Altinn Unit and integration tests As part of the coding process unit and integration-tests are created. Besides, to cover functionality, many of them cover security aspects like authentication and authorization.\nBuild phase Once a developer has finished coding a feature he/she creates a pull request in our repository.\nPeer Reviews All pull requests require peer review from at least one team member from the Altinn DevOps team.\nSee active pull requests.\nRun Unit and integration tests As part of the build pipelines, all unit and integration tests are run. This makes sure that security functionality has not been broken.\nStatic code analysis Sonar Cloud Every pull request is analyzed by Sonar Cloud\nSonar Cloud analyzes the code by a defined rule set and checks the code against OWASP Top 10, SANS Top 25 and the Co\nWe have defined some quality gates that the code need to adhere to to be able to merging pull request in to master.\nOur current active issues are available here.\nLGTM LGTM is a code analysis platform for identifying vulnerabilities and preventing them from reaching production.\nThis is run for every pull request.\nTest Each feature added to our platform is tested.\nIntegration tested with positive and negative tests for access control where possible Manual functional tests Manual security testing for selected features Dynamic code analysis. We use different tools to perform dynamic code analysis.\nSome of the tools are\nHCL AppScan We also regulary use third party secyurity companies to go through our code.\nRelease phase Releases are created automatically. For Test environments, every build is deployed automatically. For the Application Test environment and production, we deploy once a week. Those releases are created automatically. Deploy are needs to be approved by one team member.\nDeploy phase All deployment is done with an automated tool like Azure Pipelines reducing the risk for misconfiguration.\nApplications are deployed to Azure Kubernetes Services that has standard policies defined with a focus on the reduction of risk. Read more about Secure DevOps with AKS.\nOperate phase When the different applications are in production the DevOps team make sure that everything works as expected\nWe have different tools to identify security threats for our running applications.\nApplication Insights presents log and traffic information making it possible to detect different types of attacks X y Monitor phase During the monitor phase, the team follows up on how the different solutions are working and identifying improvements and changes.\nDependency updates We use Dependabot and WhiteSource Bolt to monitor updates for dependencies.\nIt creates pull request in a mirror repository\n"

Not directly compatible with Material-UI) Shared Components Shared components should utilize \u0026ldquo;Styled Components\u0026rdquo; which can write Props directly in the CSS styling. The alternative way is handling styling via props is leveraging \u0026ldquo;inline styling\u0026rdquo; combined with Material-UI\u0026rsquo;s JSS.

	"content": "What should be tested? In tjenester 3.0, there is a need for both testing Altinn Studio, the app designer, as well as testing apps that are developed by an app developer in Altinn Studio Runtime. Testing these two areas of Altinn Studio requires different approaches.\nTesting of Altinn Studio is to be tested automatically at the unit and integration levels of testing. Unit testing of the system involves, for example, the testing of individual javascript functions, and individual pieces of logic relating to react/UI components. At the integrasion level of test, API\u0026rsquo;s and smaller modules are typically tested: Effective unit and integration testing demands good testing frameworks that tjenester 3.0 developrs can easily pick up and use, and that can be easily integrated in the current codebase and the current build toolchain.\nTesting of workflows, and the usage of ALtinn Studio, as well as testing of apps developed in Altinn Studio, is the primary responsibility of the test developer in the team. On a regression, or end-to-end, level of test, one tests that the users whole journey through the altinn studio system, or the developed app, works as expected in relation to stated acceptance criteria.\nA good end-to-end test tool has the same requirements as tooling and frameworks that is to be put to use for unit and integration testing. Additionally, the tool needs to be give the opportunity for less technically minded app developers to quickly develop UI tests for apps they develop and deploy to Altinn Studio. The end-to-end tool should also allow the test developer to easily run a full regression test suite, as well as reduce the amount of time to run such a set of regression tests accurately.\nTooling After a discussion internally in the tjenester 3.0 team, these tools and frameworks have been decided to be put to use for testing\nUnit testing: Jest / Enzyme / xUnit Integration testing: Jest / Sinon Regression testing: Cypress The chosen tool set has been chosen for their ease of integration into the exisiting codebase, and also because they are all open source tools. Cypress also gives the possibility of recording tests with cypress dashboard, the test framework and UI test project will be the responsibility of the test developer in the team. Developers write unit and integration tests by using Jest and xUnit. See the other pages under test in this handbook for more information on how to effectively write unit tests or regression tests.\nDocumentation for the mentioned tools can be found below:\nxUnit Jest Enzyme Sinon Cypress Test in the first MVP delivery Testing in the first MVP delivery was primarily done thru unit testing with test written in xunit, and jest, as well as thru manual functional tests of user stories under development. The unit testing frameworks xunit and jest were integrated in the MVP01 delivery, and the tests are executed using pipeline definitions in azure devops. The unit test pipelines are automatically triggered both by pull requests to the altinn github repo, as well as when code is merged into master. The pipelines for unit tests can be found here for the xunit pipeline, and here for the jest test pipeline. At the end of MVP01, testcafe tests also began running in their own pipeline. The regression tests in the testcafe pipeline are run as a nightly build, and does not deploy on pull requests, to avoid slowing down and hindering the work of developers. The pipeline for testcafe can be found here\nTest in the second MVP delivery In the second MVP delivery, deploying apps created in the Altinn Studio designer to Altinn Studio runtime has been prioritized as a \u0026ldquo;hill\u0026rdquo;, or main deliverable. In this context, regression tests written with testcafe wil focus on the workflow the developer \u0026ldquo;Christian\u0026rdquo; will be using to be able to deploy on of his apps to a test environment. The goal of test automation is to reduce the time taken to run all test in the Altinn Studio regression test suite, to run these tests accurately, and free up the time of the test developer to write better test cases. Both automatic and manual regression tests are run against dev.altinn.studio to assure the quality of developed code that is to be deployed to production. Unit and system testing in MVP02 will work in much the same way as in the MVP01 delivery: Developers write unit and integration tests in their respective frameworks, and focus on testing business logic they have developed. Snapshot testing, which was begun in MVP01, is deprioritized in MVP02 as they were found to be brittle and not contributing to the overall quality of the code. \u0026ldquo;Look and feel\u0026rdquo; testing will be the responsibility of functional designers, and the test developer in the team.\nTest levels The pyramid figure below shows an overview of the different levels of test, the possible tools associated with the testing level, as well as which rle has the responsibilty for writing tests at that level.\nTestdata To be be able to easily and effectively test on all levels, it can be necessary to put a tool in place to easily retrieve or store different test data. The Tjenester 3.0 team must decide on whether to creat testdata classes that can be imported in the different test projects. Another possibility is to fetch spesific pre-made dataset (for example testdata set 164/5) from a json file or similar. In MVP02 the testcafe project uses a naive testdata class, that will be expanded as the new for more complex testdata grows: TestData.js contains a class for creating users in Altinn Studio at the moment. Refer to the Jest section under test for an overview on using data in unit tests.\n#Methodology During sprint planning, the product owner, the developers, and the test developer agree on an approach for teting on individual user stories that are pulled into the sprint. A plan is then created for how the responsible role will test the required functionality, and sub tasks are created on the different user stories. It is possible, and likely, that a user story will contain tasks to develop tests on all the testing levels specified above. When a test is written and completed, it can be integrated into a testing build.\nNaming convention for element ids\u0026rsquo; Cypress has different methods of getting elements from the DOM. The easiest and most robust method of defining a selector is with a css id selector. The idea behind using html-id\u0026rsquo;s is to avoid finding elements by their relative location in the DOM, or by the element\u0026rsquo;s inner texts, as tests become brittle with these selectors due to design changs. The id\u0026rsquo;s must be unique, to ensure the uniqueness of a Selector, the following naming convention for element id\u0026rsquo;s is proposed: Id\u0026rsquo;s must be tekstbased and written in camelCase, id\u0026rsquo;s follow a logical location the Altinn Studio system, such as; \u0026ldquo;Pagelocation Submenu Elementtype Descriptiveword\u0026rdquo;. The text box element id under the GUI creator could then be assigned the following id: \u0026ldquo;designerSkjemakomponenterKnappTekstområde\u0026rdquo;.\nBuilding and deploying testcode See the pipeline hyperlinks above in this document.\n"

And it is easier to configure access to a kubernetes cluster.\nResource configuration apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1 kind: IngressRoute metadata: name: altinn-runtime spec: entryPoints: - web - websecure routes: - match: Host(`dev.altinn.studio`) # priority: 25 kind: Rule services: - name: altinn-runtime port: 5005 This is the simplest service to port over to traefik 2.0 within Altinn Studio. Since it is the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; route if nothing else matches (routes for /repos or /designer).\nPay close attencion to the priority-field. If nothing is specified it will be the length of the string in the match-field. So longer rules are higher prioritized.\nRouting Middlewares In the earlier example we can hook up middlewares. You can define middlewares in this format:\napiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1 kind: Middleware metadata: name: fetch-cookie-and-redirect spec: replacePath: path: /Redirect/FetchCookieAndRedirectHome/ This example is for when the designer fetches cookies and redirects to \u0026ldquo;/home\u0026rdquo;.\nThe different specs can be found in the traefik docs.\nSo first create a middleware resource in kubernetes and then you can use it in the ingressRoute like this\nname: altinn-designer-root namespace: default entrypoints: - web routes: - match: local: Host(`altinn3.no`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Path(`/`) dev: Host(`dev.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Path(`/`) staging: Host(`staging.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Path(`/`) prod: Host(`altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Path(`/`) kind: Rule strategy: RoundRobin middlewares: [] - name: altinn-designer-home namespace: default entrypoints: - web routes: - match: local: Host(`altinn3.no`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/Home`) dev: Host(`dev.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/Home`) staging: Host(`staging.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/Home`) prod: Host(`altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/Home`) kind: Rule strategy: RoundRobin middlewares: [] - name: altinn-designer-designer namespace: default entrypoints: - web routes: - match: local: Host(`altinn3.no`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/designer`) dev: Host(`dev.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/designer`) staging: Host(`staging.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/designer`) prod: Host(`altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; PathPrefix(`/designer`) kind: Rule strategy: RoundRobin middlewares: [] - name: altinn-designer-repos namespace: default entrypoints: - web routes: - match: local: Host(`altinn3.no`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (Path(`/repos/`) || Path(`/repos`)) dev: Host(`dev.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (Path(`/repos/`) || Path(`/repos`)) staging: Host(`staging.altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (Path(`/repos/`) || Path(`/repos`)) prod: Host(`altinn.studio`) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (Path(`/repos/`) || Path(`/repos`)) kind: Rule strategy: RoundRobin middlewares: - name: fetch-cookie-and-redirect At the last entry in the routes element uses the middleware.

	"content": "When should you write tests? Unit testing includes testing of javascript functions and react/UI components. Listing of the highest priority of unit-testing:\nAPI calls with the correct formatted parameters Rendering of isolated components. Functions in general. Exporting and importing your component A quick way to get started testing your component is first to export the React Component:\nexport class CloneServiceComponent extends React.Component\u0026lt;ICloneServiceComponentProps \u0026amp; RouteChildrenProps, ICloneServiceComponentState\u0026gt; { and then reference it in your test the following way:\nimport { CloneServiceComponent } from \u0026#39;../../../src/dashboardServices/cloneService/cloneServices\u0026#39;; it(\u0026#39;+++ this is the test\u0026#39;, async () =\u0026gt; { const mountedComponent = mount( \u0026lt;CloneServiceComponent language={mockLanguage} services={mockServices} classes={mockClasses} location={mockLocation} history={mockHistory} match={mockMatch} /\u0026gt;, ); const instance = mountedComponent.instance() as CloneServiceComponent; } This will test the component without state, router or styles (read Material UI), so values usually passed in by Redux store, by means of routing or styles/Material UI needs to be reference as if they are props passed into the component (match={mockMatch}).\nMethods in your component Methods can be called directly from your test, or executed when clicked on UI elements (See own section). Calling methods is done like this:\ninstance.getCurrentRepositoryInfo(); instance.componentDidMount(); If you call networked functions in componentDidMount() you need to mock the networked functions before mounting.\nIf you have one function that calls another function, and you want to be sure that both functions ran at the end of the test, you can use jest\u0026rsquo;s spyOn functionality described here:\nconst spy = jest.spyOn(instance, \u0026#39;funcitonTwoCalledWithinFunctionOne\u0026#39;); instance.functionOne(); expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled(); You can read more about Jest.expect() here: Jest.expect()\nUser Interface and Methods In the example above, testing the actual interface is excluded. Simulating a click on an element might need to be performed twice in some cases. Simulating a click can be done using the elements ID and the simulate method from Enzyme:\nmountedComponent.find(\u0026#39;button#editService\u0026#39;).simulate(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;); ReactWrapper will pass a SyntheticEvent object to the event handler in your code. If the code you are testing uses properties that are not included in the SyntheticEvent, for instance event.target.value, you will need to provide a mock event for it to work. Read more at Enzyme\u0026rsquo;s Simulate documentation here.\nNetworked functions (get, post, put) If you are using get, post or put from the shared networking.ts component you need to mock the actual call to be able to test functions that calls either get, post or put. This can be done in the following way:\n// Add this to the import statements in you test file: import * as networking from \u0026#39;../../../../shared/src/utils/networking\u0026#39;; // To resolve the promise and and to return the value, first make sure your test is async: it(\u0026#39;should handle successfully returned data from API\u0026#39;, async () =\u0026gt; { /* Mounting goes here, commented to get markdown colors correctly const mountedComponent = mount( \u0026lt;HandleMergeConflictAbort language={mockLanguage} /\u0026gt;, ); */ // Creating the instance so you can spy or call methods directly const instance = mountedComponent.instance() as HandleMergeConflictAbort; // Spies for regular methods const spyOnClickFunctionHandler = jest.spyOn(instance, \u0026#39;clickFunctionHandler\u0026#39;); // Before you call the methods which use netowrking, you must create the spy and mock: const mockData = { isSuccessStatusCode: true, }; const getStub = jest.fn(); const mockGet = jest.spyOn(networking, \u0026#39;get\u0026#39;).mockImplementation(getStub); getStub.mockReturnValue(Promise.resolve(mockData)); // Simulate clicks mountedComponent.find(\u0026#39;button#editService\u0026#39;).simulate(\u0026#39;click\u0026#39;); // OR call methods instance.clickFunctionHandler(); // Expect functions to be called, both handler and networking expect(spyOnClickFunctionHandler).toHaveBeenCalled(); expect(mockGet).toHaveBeenCalled(); // Resolve mocked networking await Promise.resolve(); // Expect something to happen expect(instance.state.networkingRes.isSuccessStatusCode).toEqual(true); }); Rejecting Promises / Error testing / Negative tests If you want to test how your component handles rejected Promises / errors, for example in your Try/Catch you can use the following modification:\n// This is the rejected version of the mock gode const mockError = Error(\u0026#39;mocked error\u0026#39;); const getStub = jest.fn(); const mockGet = jest.spyOn(networking, \u0026#39;get\u0026#39;).mockImplementation(getStub); getStub.mockReturnValue(Promise.reject(mockError)); // You \u0026#34;execute\u0026#34; the network function the same way as a resolved promise await Promise.resolve(); You can spy on the console.error with the following code:\nlet consoleError: any; beforeAll(() =\u0026gt; { consoleError = jest.spyOn(console, \u0026#39;error\u0026#39;).mockImplementation(() =\u0026gt; { return {}; }); }); // And the following inside your test: expect(consoleError).toHaveBeenCalled(); See example #2, for more detailed test\nUsing Router If you are testing a component that uses React Router, you might have to build router props and pass them to the component you are testing. Here is an example on how this can be done:\nmockLocation = { pathname: \u0026#39;pathname\u0026#39;, search: \u0026#39;search\u0026#39;, state: {}, hash: \u0026#39;hash\u0026#39;, }; mockHistory = { length: 1, action: \u0026#39;PUSH\u0026#39; as Action, location, push: () =\u0026gt; false, replace: () =\u0026gt; false, go: () =\u0026gt; false, goBack: () =\u0026gt; false, goForward: () =\u0026gt; false, block: () =\u0026gt; (null) as any, listen: () =\u0026gt; (null) as any, createHref: () =\u0026gt; \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, }; mockMatch = { params: {}, isExact: false, path: \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, url: \u0026#39;\u0026#39;, }; Example #1, positive test import { mount } from \u0026#39;enzyme\u0026#39;;

	"content": "The frontends, both for Altinn Studio and Apps are set up as node modules, using a package.json to import external dependencies. In package.json for each package we can specify the version of the package. In this context, package refers to the different applications we are bulding, such as altinn-app-frontend, receipt, etc.\nEach time we make a change to a package, we need to update the version of the package to reflect the change. This is especially important in the packages related to Altinn.Apps - whenever changes are merged into the master branch, the compiled javascript is uploaded to a CDN where it can be used by the app, and the CDN supports versioning. So an app can refer to a specific version of f.ex. the app frontend.\nThe packages use semantic versioning:\nGiven a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:\nMAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes. Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. Each time a change is made to any frontend applications, the version in the corresponding package.json must be updated according to the rules above.\nThe default is for a new app to refer to the latest MAJOR version of the app frontend. If any changes are made that cause us to update the MAJOR version, remember to also update\rthe app template, so that any new apps will refer to the newest MAJOR version.\r"

Eg what data element is the user accessing, who owns it, what type of data element, and so on.\nThe authorization architecture for the Altinn Platform is based on the XACML reference architecture.\nThe following diagram describes the different solution components that provide Authorization capabilities.\nThis architecture defines the following components.\nPDP - Policy Decision Point Responsible to decide if a request is authorized or not. Read more\nPAP - Policy Administration Point Responsible for defining and administration authorization policies. Read more\nPRP - Policy Retrieval Point Responsible for identifying the correct policy for a request. Read more\nContext Handler Responsible for enriching the decision request so it can correctly be evaluated. Read more\nPIP - Policy information point Responsible for providing information about the subject and the resource to the context handler. Read more\nPEP - Policy Enforcement Point Responsible for enforcing the decision from PDP. This is the component that blocks a request or let it through.\nFor details about how the components are constructed go here.\nThe Overall Authorization flow The sequence diagram below shows how a request is authorized\nExample process The following example flow describes in detail the authorization process when the REACT frontend calls an API to store form data\nUser trigger save in the REACT application. REACT application makes an HTTP post request against the ServiceAPIController in The configured Policy Enforcement Point for the API, the Service Access Handler,\ntriggers to verify that user is authorized The PEP identifies the authenticated user from authorizationhandler context and find the relevant resource ID from request The PEP calls the PDP functionality in Authorization Component in Altinn Platform PDP calls context handler to enrich the decision request Context handler calls Storage PIP to get resource information Context handler calls authorization PIP to get roles user have for resource party Context handler enriches the decision request and returns to PDP PDP calls PRP to get the policy for the resource PDP evaluates the decision request and returns a decision response If the result was Permit, the PEP validates the obligation from PDP to see if the authentication level was high enough. If it is enough the request is let through If the authentication level is not high enough the PEP will throw a not authorized exception (403) If the result was \u0026ldquo;Not Applicable\u0026rdquo; the PEP will throw a not authorized exception (403) Authorization API The Authorization component exposes a REST-API to Altinn Apps. Use the authorization API to manage authorizations in altinn platform.\nParties A party is a person whom you can represent and perform a request on his behalf. A logged in user can retrieve a list of parties that he/she can represent.\nOperations Get a list of parties that the user can represent.

Make the class an extention of the IBaseCmd interface.\npublic class NewCommand : IBaseCmd { } The command attribute must be set on the class It is possible to add more parameters, explore which ones might be usefor for your command. The ones listed below are suggested as a minimum for all commands. The name parameter is what will be used to navigate to this command when running the app. Note that the name should be all lower case.\nusing McMaster.Extensions.CommandLineUtils; [Command( Name = \u0026#34;newcommand\u0026#34;, OptionsComparison = StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase, UnrecognizedArgumentHandling = UnrecognizedArgumentHandling.CollectAndContinue)] public class NewCommand :IBaseCmd { } Note that the McMaster nugetpackage is references in the class.\nInlcude the override of the OnExecuteAsync from the base class. The implementation below will show the help for the command and then complete the task. If the command does not have any sub commands simply remove app.ShowHelp(); and include your own implementation.\n/// \u0026lt;inheritdoc/\u0026gt; protected override Task OnExecuteAsync(CommandLineApplication app) { app.ShowHelp(); return Task.CompletedTask; } Place all logic and operations you wish to be executed when the command is called. If you require any input parameters check the how to section for this below.\nThe new command should now be included in Program.cs. This is so that the command is recognized and executed when inputed in the running program.\nAdd a new parameter:\nprivate static readonly CommandLineApplication\u0026lt;NewCommand\u0026gt; _newCommandCmd = new CommandLineApplication\u0026lt;NewCommand\u0026gt;(); In the Task function the standard conventions are set for the new command and all DI services are made available.\n_newCommandCmd.Conventions .UseDefaultConventions() .UseConstructorInjection(serviceProvider); Finally the command must be added to the switch case that identifies the input and routes it to the correct CommandLineApplication. Extend the switch case a shown below.\ncase \u0026#34;newcommand\u0026#34;: await _newCommandCmd.ExecuteAsync(args); break; The standard error message in the default clause of the loop should also be modified to include the new command.\ndefault: Console.WriteLine($\u0026#34;Unknown argument {string.Join(\u0026#34; \u0026#34;, args)}, Valid commands are data, instance and settings.\u0026#34;); break; \u0026hellip; add a new sub command Add a new class in the correct Subcommands-folder. It there is not subcommands folder for the command, please create this first. The class should share a name with the sub command.\nThe command attribute must be set on the class Name should be in lower case and match the class name. Note that the McMaster nugetpackage must be references to use the Command attribute.\n[Command( Name = \u0026#34;newsubcommand\u0026#34;, OptionsComparison = StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase, UnrecognizedArgumentHandling = UnrecognizedArgumentHandling.CollectAndContinue)] public class NewSubCommand :IBaseCmd { } The root command must include a reference for the new subcommand, so navigate back to newCommand.cs Add the following attribute to the class [Subcommand(typeof(NewSubCommand))]. If the class has multiple sub commands simply comma seperate them as such:\n[Subcommand(typeof(NewSubCommandA),typeof(NewSubCommandB), typeof(NewSubCommandC))] Make the class an extention of IBaseCmd and include an override of the OnExecuteAsync method.\npublic class NewCommand : IBaseCmd { protected override Task OnExecuteAsync(CommandLineApplication app) { return Task.CompletedTask; } } OnExecuteAsync will be triggered whenver the subcommand is called, so this is where all logic should be implemented. If you require input parameters check the how to below. If you require services through dependency injection a constructor should be included in the blass.\n\u0026hellip; add a new option to a command An option is simply implemented as a public property in the command class with an option attribute included. There are several input parameters for the options attribute. The ones belowe are what we suggest, but feel free to add more parameters if you require.\n[Option( CommandOptionType.SingleValue, ShortName = \u0026#34;dg\u0026#34;, LongName = \u0026#34;dataGuid\u0026#34;, ShowInHelpText = true, Description = \u0026#34;DataGuid for the data element.\u0026#34;)] public string DataGuid { get; set; } Not that the command class is not instantiated with each new command, so if you have some optional parameters, ensure that these are reset for their default value after the command is executed.\n\u0026hellip; validate an option Instead of validating the format of an option that is shared by several commands in each command where it is used it is easier to create a validation class and simply include this attribute on the option. This way validation is triggered before the command is even executed, notifying the user about their incorrect input.\nAll validation attribute classes must extend ValidationAttribute and override the validation method. See GuidAttribute for an example.\nIf an option is required add the [Required] as an attribute on the property.\n\u0026hellip; add a new service Define an interface for the service. Implement a class that extends the interface. Add the service in the function GetAndRegisterServices in Program.cs Depending on the required lifetime of the service you will have to use one of the implementations below. services.AddScoped\u0026lt;IService, Service\u0026gt;(); services.AddSingleton\u0026lt;IService, Service\u0026gt;(); services.AddTransien\u0026lt;IService, Service\u0026gt;(); Documentation on service lifetim is available here.\n"

Don\u0026rsquo;t use images for images sake. Ask yourself if the image illustrates a point or increases the understanding of what you are trying to tell. Check if the image scales well on different devices, like on mobile or a tablet. An image which looks good on a PC can quickly fill a smaller screen. Avoid using images with text, as it cannot be read by screen readers. How to write good alternative text It is important that alternative texts are written consequently. We recommend following the suggested method by UUtilsynet\nNever start with \u0026ldquo;Image of \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Write short and start with the most important part of the image End by saying if the photo is a photo, illustration or graphic.

Members of the teams \u0026ldquo;Owners\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Developers\u0026rdquo; have these rights by default. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have permissions you should talk to your organizations administrator.\nClick the \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026quot;-icon in the far right table row of the app you want to copy. Press \u0026ldquo;Lag kopi\u0026rdquo; from the menu Add the name you want for the new application. This name is used to identify the application, as well as the repository name, and URLS and API\u0026rsquo;s. The name should be short and descriptive, for instance \u0026ldquo;sick-leave\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;local-election-2019\u0026rdquo;. The name can not be changed after the application has been published. Create the copy by clicking \u0026ldquo;Kopier app\u0026rdquo;. When the application has been copied you will be redirected to the copied app. In order for the copied app to work there is some changes in the source code. These changes has automatically been added as a pull request against your repository. To navigate to the repo click the profile-icon in the top right corner and choose \u0026ldquo;Åpne repository\u0026rdquo; Navigate to the tab \u0026ldquo;Pull requests\u0026rdquo; and the that the changes under the pull request named \u0026ldquo;Auto-generated: Final changes for cloning app.\u0026rdquo;. Look through the pull request and make sure that the changes matches the new name of your application. If everything is in order the pull request can be merged by clicking \u0026ldquo;Merge pull request\u0026rdquo;. The final step is now to pull these changes to studio. Navigate to the tab with your created app and click \u0026ldquo;Pull\u0026rdquo; to fetch the changes you just merged. Voila! You are now ready to develop on your copied app. "

	"description": "Configuration of data fields for app.",
	"content": "It is useful to add extra information to instance objects in some cases. For example allowing routing the instance to the correct system in a service owners backend.\nThis can be done in two ways, by configuration or manually. Using configuration, the system will extract data from the form fields and add these to the instance object. This method is limited to form fields, but avoids programming it by yourself. If you choose to do it manually you have the freedom to add data you might want from for example external APIs, calculations, string constants, etc.\nIt is also possible to make use of both methods as long as you use different ids on the data fields. The configured values will then be collected together with the manual ones in the instance.\nData fields are in many ways similar to presentation fields. But where the use of presentation fields is predefined, the use of data fields is completely up to the individual application owner.\nConfiguration Configuration of data fields is done in applicationmetadata.json which is located in the folder App/config.\nAdd a new object with the key dataFields, using the following properties\nName Description id The ID of the datafield. Used to identify the field when saved in the instance. path Datamodel path to the form field. This value is the same value that is bound to a component in the app\u0026rsquo;s layout file. dataTypeId Id of the datamodel where the value is collected from. The configuration for an app with two defined data fields will look like this:\n\u0026#34;dataFields\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;AnsettelseAntAar\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;OpplysningerOmArbeidstakeren-grp-8819.Arbeidsforhold-grp-8856.AnsattAar-datadef-33267.value\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataTypeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Navn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;path\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;OpplysningerOmArbeidstakeren-grp-8819.OpplysningerOmArbeidstakeren-grp-8855.AnsattNavn-datadef-1223.value\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataTypeId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; }] The result will be a list in the instance object with values from the configured fields:\n\u0026#34;dataValues\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;AnsettelseAntAar\u0026#34;: 10, \u0026#34;Navn\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ola Nordmann\u0026#34; } Notice that the instance object is named dataValues even when the configured is named dataFields, this is because dataValues is the result of the configuration which is done in dataFields.\nManually To manually add data values the method UpdateDataValuesfrom the IInstance interface is used. It is the same method which is called when the fields in dataValues are populated from configuration and it will merge all values into a list.\nBe aware that it is the application developer's responsibility to ensure unique IDs if you combine data values between configuration and a manual implementation.\rValues that share IDs will override each other and there is no way to guarantee which will be saved in the instance. The example below displays how to set data values manually. In this case it is done by adding code within RunProcessTaskEnd in App.cs, which is run when a task is completed.\npublic override async Task RunProcessTaskEnd(string taskId, Instance instance) { var customDataValues = new DataValues() { Values = new Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt;() { { \u0026#34;customKey\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customValue\u0026#34; } } }; var (instanceOwnerPartyId, instanceGuid) = InstanceHelper.DeconstructInstanceIdFromUrl(_httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Request.Path.Value); await _instanceService.UpdateDataValues(instanceOwnerPartyId, instanceGuid, customDataValues); await Task.CompletedTask; } It is recommended to think through the necessity of these values for the instance object so that it avoids unnecessary API calls which impact the performance of the application.\r"

	"description": "How to configure prefill for an app.",
	"content": "As of today, Altinn offers three methods for prefilling data in an app for a user. These methods can be combined freely to reach the desired result.\nPrefill from national register and user profile Altinn apps support prefill with data from the Central Coordinating Register (Enhetsregisteret), the National Population Register (Folkeregisteret) and user profile in Altinn.\nBy following the description below, you will during instantiation of a form prefill the data model with the defined values obtained from Altinns data base.\nSetup of prefill in the application repository Create a new json file in the app repo under App/models. The name of the file should contain the name of the data model and have the postfix \u0026ldquo;.prefill.json\u0026rdquo;. If the data model is called appModel you should now be able to find these three files in the map: appModel.metadata.json, appModel.schema.json, appModel.prefill.json\nPaste the code below into the file.\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/prefill/prefill.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowOverwrite\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;ER\u0026#34;: { }, \u0026#34;DSF\u0026#34;: { }, \u0026#34;UserProfile\u0026#34;: { } } Configuration of prefill.json $schema points to the json schema definition of the file. The current version is v1. Because of this file, Visual Studio Code will validate and offer intellisense/autocomplete when you edit the file locally.\nallowOverwrite determines whether prefill defined in this file can overwrite a field in the data model if it already has a value.\nER here you enter fields from the data model that are to be prefilled with data from the Central Coordinating Register. Fields that are prefilled with ER-data will only have a value if you instantiate on behalf of an organization. Instantiation will fail if you attempt to prefill ER-data, but do not have an organization available.\nThe example below will populate the field Datamodell.Organisasjon.Organisasjonsnummer with the organization number retrieved from the Central Coordinating register.\n\u0026#34;ER\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;OrgNumber\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Datamodell.Organisasjon.Organisasjonsnummer\u0026#34; } DSF here you enter fields from the data model that are to be prefilled with data from the National Population Register. The field that is prefilled with DSF-data will only have a value if you instantiate on behalf of a person. Instatiation will fail if you attempt to prefill DSF-data, but do not have a person available. The example below will populate the field Datamodell.Person.Nummer with the phone number retrieved from the National Population Register.\n\u0026#34;DSF\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;TelephoneNumber\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Datamodell.Person.Nummer\u0026#34; } UserProfile here you enter fields from the data model that are to be prefilled with data from the users profile in Altinn. Note that it is the logged in user who instantiates the app the data is collected for. The example below will populate the field Datamodell.Bruker.Epost with the email retrieved from the users profile in Altinn.\n\u0026#34;UserProfile\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Email\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Datamodell.Bruker.Epost\u0026#34; } Available prefill values The JSON-schema definition of the prefill file is also available here. The use of a schema enables editors, e.g. Visual Studio Code, to validate and offer intellisense for faster editing.\nThe National Population Register The personal data that is exposed is attached to the person the form is instantiated on behalf of. If Ola Nordmann were to instantiate a form on behalf of Kari Nordmann, it would be Kari\u0026rsquo;s data that would be exposed. Available values for prefill includes:\nSSN Name FirstName MiddleName LastName TelephoneNumber MobileNumber MailingAddress MailingPostalCode MailingPostalCity AddressMunicipalNumber AddressMunicipalName AddressStreetName AddressHouseNumber AddressHouseLetter AddressPostalCode AddressCity The Central Coordinating Register The unit exposed is that which is attached to the organization a form is instantiated on behalf of. Available values for prefill includes:\nOrgNumber Name UnitType TelephoneNumber MobileNumber FaxNumber EMailAddress InternetAddress MailingAddress MailingPostalCode MailingPostalCity BusinessAddress BusinessPostalCode BusinessPostalCity User profile The user profile exposed is the profile belonging to the one who instantiatd the service. If Ola Nordmann instantiates a form on behalf of Kari Nordmann, the data retrieved from here would belong to Ola. For the objects Party.Organization and Party.Person, you will find the same fields that are included in ER and DSF-prefill. Note that Party.Organization will be null if the user is logged in as an individual, and the equivalent if they are logged in with a business user. The prefill will fail if the object you prefill from does not exist, so if you wish to dynamically prefill based on these values it has to be setup as custom prefill.. Available values for prefill includes:\nUserId UserName PhoneNumber Email PartyId Party.PartyId Party.PartyTypeName Party.OrgNumber Party.SSN Party.UnitType Party.Name Party.isDeleted Party.OnlyHierarchyElementWithNoAccess Party.Person Party.Organization Party.ChildParties UserType ProfileSettingPreference.Language ProfileSettingPreference.PreSelectedPartyId ProfileSettingsPreference.DoNotPromptForParty Custom prefill Altinn apps enable prefill of an instance with custom data, whether it is the result of an API call, calculations done under instantiation or other logic. This is implemented in the method DataCreation in the file InstantiationHandler.cs that can be found in the application repo under App/logic.\nThe example below populates the field Bruker.FulltNavn in the model Datamodell with the value \u0026ldquo;Test Testesen\u0026rdquo;.\npublic async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data) { if (data.GetType() == typeof(Datamodell)) { Datamodell model = (Datamodell)data; model.Bruker.FulltNavn = \u0026#34;Test Testesen\u0026#34;; } } Replace Data model with the name on the C# class that has been generated based on the xsd uploaded to Altinn Studio. If you use a suitable code editor you will be able to define fields to be populated using intellisense.\nKeep in mind that if you have complex types in your model, these will need to be instantiated before you can assign a value to one of the type\u0026rsquo;s subelements. See the example below where we assume that Bruker and Name are separate C# classes.\npublic async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data) { if (data.GetType() == typeof(Datamodell)) { Datamodell model = (Datamodell)data; Bruker b = new Bruker(); b.Navn = new Name(); b.Navn.FulltNavn = \u0026#34;Test Testesen\u0026#34;; } } Instantiation with prefill Altinn apps support instantiation with prefill. The form data is attached in a multipart in the instantiation request that is sent to the app. Below you will se an example of a requeest to instantiate an app with prefill for partyID 12345.\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=\u0026#34;abcdefg\u0026#34; Body: --abcdefg Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026#34;instance\u0026#34; { \u0026#34;instanceOwner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;PartyId\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;12345\u0026#34; } } --abcdefg Content-Type: application/xml Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\u0026#34;Endring-av-navn\u0026#34; \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Skjema xmlns:xsi=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\u0026#34; xmlns:xsd=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\u0026#34; skjemanummer=\u0026#34;1533\u0026#34; spesifikasjonsnummer=\u0026#34;11172\u0026#34; blankettnummer=\u0026#34;RF-1453\u0026#34; tittel=\u0026#34;Endring av navn\u0026#34; gruppeid=\u0026#34;9308\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Innledning-grp-9309 gruppeid=\u0026#34;9309\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NavneendringenGjelderFor-grp-9310 gruppeid=\u0026#34;9310\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;SubjektFornavnFolkeregistrert-datadef-34730 orid=\u0026#34;34730\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Ola Nordmann\u0026lt;/SubjektFornavnFolkeregistrert-datadef-34730\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/NavneendringenGjelderFor-grp-9310\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Kontaktinformasjon-grp-9311 gruppeid=\u0026#34;9311\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;MelderFultnavn orid=\u0026#34;34735\u0026#34;\u0026gt;LANGØY MADS\u0026lt;/MelderFultnavn\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Kontaktinformasjon-grp-9311\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Innledning-grp-9309\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Skjema\u0026gt; --abcdefg-- "

Validation will be performed based on current task in the process. Validation will ensure that all required data elements, as defined by the application metadata, have been uploaded and are valid. If the result of the validation is that nothing is missing or wrong, the action will update the instance with information indicating that the instance is valid. The response will be an empty array. In the case of validation issues the response will provide an array of the identified issues. Validation of a full instance use validation of data as described in the chapter below.\nGET https://{org}.apps.at21.altinn.cloud/{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/{instanceId}/validate Example response:\n[ { \u0026#34;severity\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Error\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scope\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;INSTANCE\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;targetId\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;field\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;code\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TooManyDataElementsOfType\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TooManyDataElementsOfType\u0026#34; } ] Validate stored data This action will validate a specific data element already uploaded and stored in Altinn.

	"title": "Code lists (options)",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "How to configure Options / Code lists for an app.",
	"content": "Altinn offers two different ways an application can use code lists - static and dynamic. Both is done through the options api exposed by the application, and the code lists are available through the endpoint {org}/{app}/api/options/{optionsId}. Checkbox, Dropdown, and RadioButton components will automatically be able to fetch such lists if you connect the component to the option id in question.\nStatic codelists from the application repository By adding json based option files in the application repository, the application will automatically read the file and expose it through the options api. For this to work, the files must be placed in the App/options/ folder and be named according to the following conventions {optionId}.json for the application to recognize them.\nFor example if you have a list of countries in a file named countries.json, the optionId would be countries, and would be exposed through the api at {org}/{app}/api/options/countries. The static codelists should be in a special format as shown below:\n[ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;norway\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Norge\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;denmark\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Danmark\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sweden\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;country.label.sweden\u0026#34; } ] Note that the label field can be a key to a text resource (as shown above for sweden) or plain text.\nDynamic codelists generated runtime As an alternative to the static files you can have code that determines what the lists should be during runtime. This makes it possible to expose dynamic values that for instance are filtered or looked up in external sources. Dynamic codelists can either be open and accessible to all or secured and limited to those with read access to the instance.\nIn versions prior to 4.24.0 this was done by overriding the GetOptions method in App.cs. This method is now deprecated and is replaced by putting the option code in separate classes implementing an interface and registering the implementation in the application dependency injection container. This allows for better separation, inject dependencies into the constructor, pass in language and other query parameters and generally handle all aspects of the implementation as you see fit.\nFor codelists that are open you implement the IAppOptionsProvider interface and for codelists that should be secured you implement the IInstanceAppOptionsProvider interface. The pattern is the same for both, and the models returned is the same, but the implementation is kept separate to avoid exposing data that should be secured.\nOpen dynamic codelists Below you find an example of how to implement a open custom options provider. The url will will still be exposed from the same endpoint as before {org}/{app}/api/options/countires.\nusing Altinn.App.Common.Models; using Altinn.App.PlatformServices.Options; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; namespace Altinn.App.Core { public class CountryAppOptionsProvider : IAppOptionsProvider { public string Id { get; set; } = \u0026#34;countries\u0026#34;; public Task\u0026lt;AppOptions\u0026gt; GetAppOptionsAsync(string language, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; keyValuePairs) { var options = new AppOptions { Options = new List\u0026lt;AppOption\u0026gt; { new AppOption { Label = \u0026#34;Norway\u0026#34;, Value = \u0026#34;47\u0026#34; }, new AppOption { Label = \u0026#34;Sweden\u0026#34;, Value = \u0026#34;46\u0026#34; } } }; return Task.FromResult(options); } } } For your implementation to be picked up you need to add the following line in your Startup.cs (or Program.cs in .NET 6):\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;IAppOptionsProvider, CountryAppOptionsProvider\u0026gt;(); Note that you can have multiple registrations of this interface. The correct implementation is resolved by finding the one with the correct id.\nThe interface has a property Id, which should be set to the optionId, and a method GetAppOptionsAsync for resolving the options. This method accepts a language code and a dictionary of key/value pairs. Both parameters will typically be query parameters picked up from the controller and passed in. Allthough language could be put in the dictionary as well it\u0026rsquo;s decided to be explicit on this particular parameter.\nLanguage codes should be based on ISO 639-1 or the W3C IANA Language Subtag Registry. The latter is built uppon the ISO 639-1 standard but is guaranties uniques of the codes, where as ISO 639-1 have conflicting usage for some codes.\nSecured dynamic options NOTICE: to use this functionality the app must use version \u0026gt;= 4.27.0 of the nuget packages Altinn.App.PlatformServices, Altinn.App.Common and Altinn.App.Api.\nIf you want to expose options that are sensitive you can use IInstanceAppOptionsProvider, which will validate that the user has read rights defined in the authorization policy defined in the app\u0026rsquo;s policy.xml-file. Below you find an example of how to implement a secured custom options provider. The IInstanceAppOptionsProvider interface must be implemented, and a secure-prop must be added to the component. The following option will be exposed at /{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerId}/{instanceGUID}/options/children.\nusing System.Collections.Generic; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.Common.Models; using Altinn.App.PlatformServices.Models; namespace Altinn.App.Core { public class ChildrenAppOptionsProvider : IInstanceAppOptionsProvider { public string Id { get; set; } = \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;; public Task\u0026lt;AppOptions\u0026gt; GetInstanceAppOptionsAsync(InstanceIdentifier instanceIdentifier, string language, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; keyValuePairs) { // ... // Some custom code to get the list of children from the instance owner // ... var options = new AppOptions { Options = new List\u0026lt;AppOption\u0026gt; { new AppOption { Label = \u0026#34;Ole\u0026#34;, Value = \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; }, new AppOption { Label = \u0026#34;Dole\u0026#34;, Value = \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; }, new AppOption { Label = \u0026#34;Doffen\u0026#34;, Value = \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; } } }; return Task.FromResult(options); } } } For your implementation to be picked up you need to add the following line in your Startup.cs (or Program.cs in .NET 6):\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;IInstanceAppOptionsProvider, ChildrenAppOptionsProvider\u0026gt;(); Note that you can have multiple registrations of this interface. The correct implementation is resolved by finding the one with the correct id.\nThe interface has a property Id, which should be set to the optionId, and a method GetInstanceAppOptionsAsync for resolving the options. This method accepts a language code and a dictionary of key/value pairs. Both parameters will typically be query parameters picked up from the controller and passed in. Allthough language could be put in the dictionary as well it\u0026rsquo;s decided to be explicit on this particular parameter. These parameters are the same as for the open variant of options, in addition the instance id (which identifies both the instance owner and the instance itself) will be passed in.\nThe final configuration needed is the secure-boolean on the component. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown-component\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Some title\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Some description\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.field\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;secure\u0026#34;: true } Connect the component to options (code list) This is done by adding the optionId you would like to refer to either through the component UI in Designer or direcytly in FormLayout.json as shown below:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8e6f7b2f-fcf0-438d-8336-c1a8e1e03f44\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;countries\u0026#34;, } Pass query parameters when fetching options Options supports query parameters when making the api call. language is added automatically, and you can also add custom parameters by defining mapping on the component.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;c66d7b69-2e18-4786-af44-1fa913853618\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NyGarantiLoyvetype\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;soknad.nyGaranti.loyvetype\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;optionsId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;loyvetyper\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;mapping\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;soknad.transportorOrgnummer\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;orgnummer\u0026#34; } }, In the example above, the query parameter orgnummer={nr}, where {nr} is the value of soknad.transportorOrgnummer will be set. If an option is setup with mapping and the given data field changes app-frontend will refetch the option. This can be used to dynamicly decide which choices are availibable based on information given by the end user.\nDuring PDF-generation the app will try to call the same option endpoint as app-frontend does.\rWe currently has a weakness where mapping paramteres not are included in this request, see issue [#7903.](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/issues/7903)\rA possible workaround here is to return an empty array when the PDF-generator asks for options with empty query params, example:\nstring someArg = keyValuePairs.GetValueOrDefault(\u0026#34;someArg\u0026#34;); string someOtherArg = keyValuePairs.GetValueOrDefault(\u0026#34;someOtherArg\u0026#34;); if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(someArg) || string.IsNullOrEmpty(someOtherArg)) { return await Task.FromResult(new List\u0026lt;AppOption\u0026gt;()); } Notice that this wil result in the option value and not the label being present as the end users answer.\nOptions based on repeating groups from Redux Traditional options are based on resources fetched from the backend. This approach differs a bit from this, as it enables setting up a direct connection from the options to the form data that is stored in app frontend. A use case here would typically be if the user fills out a repeating list of data that should later be selected in a dropdown/checkbox/radiobutton.\nConfiguration To set up options from redux we have set up a new property on RadioButtons, Checkboxes, and Dropdown-components called source. This property contains the fields group, label, and value. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown-component-id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Dropdown\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;source\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.group[{0}].someField\u0026#34; } }, Explanation:\ngroup - the group field in the data model to base the options on label - a reference to a text id to be used as the label for each iteration of the group, see more below. value - a reference to a field in the group that should be used as the option value. Notice that we set up this [{0}] syntax. Here the {0} will be replaced by each index of the group. Notice that the value field must be unique for each element. If the repeating group does not contain a field which is unique for each item it is recommended to add a field to the data model that can be used as identificator, for instance a GUID.\nAs for the label property, we have to define a text resource that can be used as a label for each repetition of the group. This follows similar syntax as the value, and will also be familiar if you have used variables in text.\nExample text resource connected:\n{ \u0026#34;language\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;resources\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dropdown.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Person: {0}, Age: {1}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variables\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.group[{0}].name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.default\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.group[{0}].age\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.default\u0026#34; } ] } ] } In the example above we have two parameters in the text which is referencing fields in the group. We also recognize the [{0}] syntax in the key prop which enables the usage of this label for each index in the group.\n"

	"description": "In an application one can facilitate uploading file attachments both via GUI and API.",
	"content": "Methods for uploading file attachments In an Altinn application there are two options for uploading file attachments:\nFile upload component in a form API-call to app backend The former will be a good alternative for all data where it is expected that the user will upload files through the user interface in the app. The latter is recommended for use if it is only expected that systems will upload the attachment. There is no limit to how many attachments that can be included in one application and both upload methods can be used within the same application.\nBelow is a simple description of how you can accommodate your application to be able to receive attachments.\nSubmitting file attachments with file upload component in a form When building your form in Altinn Studio, a file upload component is available. It is possible to upload multiple file attachments on one single component, and how many file upload components you use in your application will be determined by the characteristics of the documents you expect to be uplaoded and any restrictions you need to impose. (see configuration of file attachments for more information on this).\nNote: It will also be possible to upload file attachments of the type defined in the attachment component through API.\nThe image above shows the file upload component in Altinn Studio. Part of the configuration for the uploaded attachments can be set up here.\nCustom file types can be specified if you want to limit the file types that can be submitted. In this case, a user will be prevented from uploading if the file type is not in the approved list. The minimum/maximum amount of file attachments can be specified if you want a specific amount of attachments uploaded through the component. By setting the value of minst antall filvedlegg to \u0026lsquo;0\u0026rsquo; it will not be required to upload a file. The maxmimum file size is specified in MB. Additional configurations that can be set for attachments include: allowed contributors and description. This is conigured in applicationMetadata.json which is placed under App/config in the application repo.\nFile upload component with tagging There is also a separate component where the user tags the file using a dropdown list. This is configured pretty similarily to the normal file upload component, with the addition of a codelist-ID and the name you want the tag to have.\nBelow you can see it in use\nSubmission of attachments with API-call To accommodate being able to submit attachments without this being supported in GUI, you will need to add a datatype object in the applicationMetadata.json (the file is under App/config in the application repo). It will then only be possible to submit attachments of this type through API-calls. For a more detailed description of the available fields, see configuration of attachments\nConfiguration of attachments In applicationMetadata.json (placed in App/config in the application repo) you will find a property called \u0026lsquo;dataTypes\u0026rsquo;. Configuration of all data types supported in the application can be found here, both form data (app model data) and file attachments. The field appLogic, that can also be found among some of the objects in the list, should only be used for form data.\nBelow there are two examples of dataTypes-instances from a deployed application.\n\u0026#34;dataTypes\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;53a50f0d-2345-448d-9fba-f18e6bbe71f8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxSize\u0026#34;: 25, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;:[\u0026#34;application/pdf\u0026#34;] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;attest\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxSize\u0026#34;: 25, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;allowedContributers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;org:nav\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;orgNo:XXXXXXXXXX\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;grouping\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Attester\u0026#34;, } ] Id on the attachment type This will be set as a GUID if you use an attachment component from Altinn Studio like the one you can find in the first element in the dataTypes list. If you want to change the value to a more sensible name then you should note that this change must be done two places: applicationMetadata.json and FormLayout.json. (Only relevant if you added a file upload component to the GUI)\ntaskID denotes which step in the process it is expected that this attachment is uploaded to. This value must be identical to one of the tasks in process.bpmn.\nmaxSize denotes the maximum allowed size of the attachment.\nmaxCount denotes the upper limit for how many attachments of this type that are to be uploaded per instance.\nminCount denotes the lower limit for how many attachments of this type that are to be uploaded per instance. If the value is 0 then it is not required to upload a file attachment of this type.\nallowedContributors specifies who is allowed to create and/or modify file attachments of this type. This is specified on the format {key}:{value}. Allowed keys include: \u0026lsquo;org\u0026rsquo;; three letter abbreviation for organization and *orgNo\u0026rsquo;; organization number. It is as of today not possible to specify an organization that is not registered as a service owner.\nallowedContentTypes specifies which file attachment types that are allowed. The most frequently used include: application/pdf, text/xml, image/jpeg. If you do not want to set a limit to the type of attachments, you will not need to define this parameter. Read more on mime types here.\ngrouping denotes the group that the file attachments should be gropued according to. This is an optional attribute, where file attachments with the same grouping will be sorted into the same list. Grouping can be both a string (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Certificates\u0026rdquo;) or a text key if you wish to configure multiple languages (e.g. \u0026ldquo;form.attachmentgrouping\u0026rdquo;).

This functionally can be used whenever the receiver of a shipment is to be determined dynamically.\nThree steps are required when defining the receiver in the application logic, and all steps are executed in App.cs.\nAt the top of the file, a reference to the eFormidling library must be included. using Altinn.Common.EFormidlingClient.Models.SBD; Include the function below in the class. Expected output from this method is a list containing at least one receiver object.\npublic override async Task\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;Receiver\u0026gt;\u0026gt; GetEFormidlingReceivers(Instance instance) { Identifier identifier = new Identifier { Authority = \u0026#34;iso6523-actorid-upis\u0026#34; }; // 0192 prefix for all Norwegian organisations. identifier.Value = \u0026#34;[INSERT ORGANISATION NUMBER HERE WITH PREFIX `0192:`]\u0026#34; ; Receiver receiver = new Receiver { Identifier = identifier }; return new List\u0026lt;Receiver\u0026gt; { receiver }; } Add custom logic to populate identifier.Value in the function. Note that only Norwegian organisations are supported, and that the prefix 0192: is required before the organisation number.\nTesting eFormidling integration locally It is possible to test the eFormidling integration for an application in your development environment. In addition to Altinn\u0026rsquo;s Localtest, and the application, there are two things that need to run:\neFormidling integration point (Integrasjonspunktet) A mock of eFormidling Setup Install the latest version of Java. Download link and installation guide is available here\nIn the next steps you will be downloading a number of files. Define a suitable placement for everything eFormidling related on your local machine and navigate there in your terminal.\nClone the eFormidling mock repository with the following command\ngit clone --branch development https://github.com/felleslosninger/efm-mocks.git Download the integration point. The contents can be places at the same level as the efm-mocks folder.\nRunning eFormidling locally Open a terminal and navigate to efm-mocks (Command prompt or bash is recommended, PowerShell will not work.) Run docker-compose up -d Navigate to the folder where the integration point file exists. Run the command java -Xmx2g -Dspring.profiles.active=mock -jar integrasjonspunkt-2.2.6.jar If you have a newer version of the integration point, the commands last section should be adjusted to reflect this. Verify that eFormidling is set up correctly This requires that node and npm is present on your machine, but they are note required to use the mock.\nOpen a terminal and navigate to efm-mocks/tests/ Run npm i Navigate into the folder next-move Run node NextMove.js dpf Verify in a browser at localhost:8001 that there are new table entries containing the sent messages. Read more about the mock here\nTesting eFormidling integration in a test environment Thorough testing for the eFormidling integration in an application is encouraged.\rSafety measures and retry mechanisms are in place to ensure that a shipment reaches the receiver when errors are due to weak network connections.\rHowever, invalid shipments, including but not limited to missing attachments or mistakes in the \"arkivmelding\",\rvil cause the shipment to fail without explicit warning the end user or app owner.\rThe integration point exposes endpoints that allow you to monitor the status of a shipment. https://platform.altinn.no/eformidling/api/conversations?messageId={instanceGuid}\nReplace {instanceGuid} with the guid of the instance that has been archived.\n"

	"content": "Standard .NET configuration Altinn 3\u0026rsquo;s app template is based on an ASP.Net Core application and has a multidude of possibilities for controlling configuration of an app. This documentation is therefore in large part quotes from or links to Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s own documentation. However, not everything is possible in an application because Altinn 3 does not give full access to the environment an app is run within.\nappsettings.json The first and simplest source for configuration information are the appsettings files. Every new app which is created will come with an existing appsettings.json file. This file is read by an app during startup independently of what environment the app runs in. This means the file should only contain settings which are equal in all environments. The file contains some settings that are already in use and the values are in large part meant for a development environment where the application is run within LocalTest\nIn appsettings.json the values are organized in different sections. It is not recommended to add new values to the existing sections, creating new sections is recommended. The following sections are reserved to avoid collisions: Kestrel, AppSettings, GeneralSettings, PlatformSettings, PEPSettings, ApplicationInsights, kvSettings.\n{ \u0026#34;ExampleSection\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ExampleValue\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Verdi lest inn i alle miljøer, men kanskje overstyrt av miljøspesifikke kilder\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;AppSettings\u0026#34;: { ... }, \u0026#34;GeneralSettings\u0026#34;: { ... }, \u0026#34;PlatformSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ApiStorageEndpoint\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://localhost:5101/storage/api/v1/\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ApiRegisterEndpoint\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://localhost:5101/register/api/v1/\u0026#34;, ... }, \u0026#34;ApplicationInsights\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;InstrumentationKey\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;retrieved from environment at runtime\u0026#34; } } In the future new apps will have a designated section which is simple to expand. In the meantime we refer to Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s own documentation for how this should be done.\nEnvironment specific appsettings A new app will contain a set of environment specific appsettings files: appsettings.Development.json, appsettings.Staging.json and appsettings.Production.json. These files are read in their respective environments. The TT02-environment is defined as staging and the production environment is defined as Production.\nEvery file should contain the values which are unique or different in at least one of the environments. Examples of values that vary from environment to environment is the \u0026ldquo;timeout\u0026rdquo; values. You might want an app to wait longer for a response from an external API during development than what you want to allow during production.\nappsettings.Development.json { \u0026#34;ExampleSection\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ExampleValue\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Verdi lest inn kun for utviklingsmiljø\u0026#34; } } appsettings.Staging.json { \u0026#34;ExampleSection\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ExampleValue\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Verdi lest inn kun for TT02\u0026#34; } } appsettings.Production.json { \u0026#34;ExampleSection\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ExampleValue\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Verdi lest inn kun for produksjon\u0026#34; } } Environment variables Standard behaviour for an ASP.Net application is to read Environment variables. This is also done for an app, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t possible for an app developer to create or change any of these values. Altinn 3 considers the other method of controlling Environment specific variables to be covered by appsettings and KeyVault.\nCommand line arguments It is technically possible to override all other data sources by using command line arguments. It is however not possible to use this to change values from one environment to another.\nAzure KeyVault Every application owner should have access to their own Azure KeyVault for storage of sensitive values. Sensitive values includes values which you don\u0026rsquo;t want to be visible in code or configuration files. Examples include usernames and passwords for external APIs, certificates, private keys, etc.\nCurrently values from KeyVault are not read into the configuration control of an App. Instead the secrets component is used. This is documented under Secrets.\n"

	"description": "How to add configuration to control behavior at the application startup.",
	"content": "Introduction to stateless applications A stateless application differentiates itself from standard applications by not storing any data, including form data or metadata about instances of the application. Because of this, a stateless application is a good choice for information transparency services where the end user or a system is doing a lookup against one or more resources or presents data from a third party based on who the user is. It is also possible to configure a stateless application to only allow anonymous users, or users that are not logged on.\nConfiguration This is brand new functionality. Setup has to be completed manually until further notice.\nNotice: To make use of this functionality, version \u0026gt;= 4.5.2 of the nuget packages Altinn.App.PlatformServices, Altinn.App.Common and Altinn.App.Api is required.\nIn the application metadata it is possible to control behaviours during startup. Your application can now act like a stateless application if it is enabled. For an application like this, no data or metadata is stored, and the application will also not end up in the message box of an end user. This is equivalent to a stateless application in Altinn 2.\nConfiguration of this is done in applicationmetadata.json. Example:\n{\r\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd/stateless-app-demo\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;org\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: {\r\u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stateless App Demo\u0026#34;\r},\r\u0026#34;dataTypes\u0026#34;: [\r{\r\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ref-data-as-pdf\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [\r\u0026#34;application/pdf\u0026#34;\r],\r\u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 0,\r\u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 0\r},\r{\r\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stateless\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [\r\u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34;\r],\r\u0026#34;appLogic\u0026#34;: {\r\u0026#34;autoCreate\u0026#34;: true,\r\u0026#34;classRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn.App.Models.StatelessV1\u0026#34;\r},\r\u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1,\r\u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 1\r}\r],\r...\r\u0026#34;onEntry\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;show\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;stateless\u0026#34; } // legg til denne linjen\r} In the field onEntry.show there is the opportunity to reference a layout set which you want to display during startup of the application. Read more about layout-sets here.\nThe layout sets you refer to here will be used as the display the user is presented before navigating to the application.\nThe configuration file layout-sets.json can be created if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t already exist. It should be located in the folder App/ui. In layout-sets.json you add the actual set you are refering to from applicationmetadata.json, Example:\n{ \u0026#34;sets\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;stateless\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stateless\u0026#34; } ] } In the example above the layout-set stateless is referring to the datamodel Stateless. Example of an app structure for an application which is set up in this way:\n├───App ├───config ├───logic ├───models │ Stateless.cs │ Stateless.metadata.json │ Stateless.schema.json │ Stateless.xsd ├───ui │ layout-sets.json │ └───stateless | RuleConfiguration.json │ RuleHandler.js │ Settings.json │ └───layouts FormLayout.json FormLayout.json should then be set up the same way as any normal application, and will support all components which are possible to use in a normal app with the exception of:\nFile upload Button App frontend will read the configuration in applicationmetadata.json and understand that it isn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to instantiate, and then collect the layout-files and the connected datamodel, and present it to the end user.\nConfiguring access without login Note! Form components that affect process (Button for submission or instantiation) are not supported for anonymous users!\rNote: To make use of this functionality you must use version \u0026gt;= 5.1.0 of the nuget packages Altinn.App.PlatformServices, Altinn.App.Common and Altinn.App.Api.\nTo permit use of an app by a user that is not logged in, you must follow the steps that are described above. You also have to define the data type which is used by the stateless app to allow anonymous use. This is done by modifying the dataType-element in applicationMetadata.json. The datatype\u0026rsquo;s appLogic-object needs a new setting, \u0026quot;allowAnonymousOnStateless\u0026quot;: true. See example below:\n{\r\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd/stateless-app-demo\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;org\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ttd\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: {\r\u0026#34;nb\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stateless App Demo\u0026#34;\r},\r\u0026#34;dataTypes\u0026#34;: [\r{\r\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ref-data-as-pdf\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [\r\u0026#34;application/pdf\u0026#34;\r],\r\u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 0,\r\u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 0\r},\r{\r\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stateless\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [\r\u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34;\r],\r\u0026#34;appLogic\u0026#34;: {\r\u0026#34;autoCreate\u0026#34;: true,\r\u0026#34;classRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Altinn.App.Models.StatelessV1\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;allowAnonymousOnStateless\u0026#34;: true,\r},\r\u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;,\r\u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1,\r\u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 1\r}\r],\r...\r\u0026#34;onEntry\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;show\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;stateless\u0026#34; } } Populating data When using a stateless data type you will be able to populate the data model in when the app front-end requests the form data.\nData will be populated in two steps during the initial call from the front-end (GET):\nPrefill, read more about this here. Data processing, read more about this here. The following updates to the same form data (POST) will then run prefill one more time, but the calculation is triggered. This allows manipulating the data based on the user\u0026rsquo;s input even in stateless application.\nExample of a calculation which populates the data model mentioned in the example above:\npublic async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataRead(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { if (instance.GetType() == typeof(StatelessV1)) { StatelessV1 form = (StatelessV1) data; // Here you can do what you want, for ex. an API-call // if your service is supposed to act as an information transparency service form.Fornavn = \u0026#34;Test\u0026#34;; form.Etternavn = \u0026#34;Testesten\u0026#34;; return true } return false; } Authorization with third party solutions Controlling access for stateless applications can be done with standard app-authorization Where by using Altinn roles you define who has access to the service. If you require further securing of your service you can implement logic for authorization of users with third party solutions. This can be an API which is exposed in your organization or an open API from a different provider.\nIn the example below, an API from the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway is used to determine if a company that is represented by a user in Altinn has the necessary licenses to use a service.\nThe source code for the example application can be found here. (Requires account in Altinn Studio.)\nFurther down this page we will use the designation user synonymously with an organization represented by a person in Altinn.\nExpand the data model with fields for authorization\nIn addition to a field for user input and a field to display the result, in this example we have a field for holding information about if the user is authenticated and a field for holding a dynamic error message.\n\u0026lt;xs:sequence\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element name=\u0026#34;searchString\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xs:string\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element name=\u0026#34;result\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xs:string\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element name=\u0026#34;userAuthorized\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xs:boolean\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;xs:element name=\u0026#34;errorMessage\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;xs:string\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/xs:sequence\u0026gt; Skip to step 4 if the application will only be used via an API.\nAdd a field to display error messages in the user interface\nThere are three components to the user interface of an application. A search field for user input, a text field dedicated to showing a search result and a paragraph which is reserved for error messages.\nThe components are connected to a data model and text resource in the following way in FormLayout.json\n\u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sokeBoks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SearchString\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;searchString\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: false }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;resultatBoks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TextArea\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Result\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;result\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: true }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;errorBoks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Paragraph\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ErrorMessage\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;readOnly\u0026#34;: true } ] Add dynamic rules to show/hide fields\nWe use dynamic rules to show/hide fields depending on the users level of authorization\nThere has been added a dynamic rule in RuleHandler.js which checks if a field in the datamodel has the value false. Configuration of rules is described more closely here.\nIn RuleConfiguration.json you can see how the rule is utilized. If the input value from the data model userAuthorized is false, the errorBox-component will be made visible, while the opposite happens to the search and result fields as those are hidden.\nDefault behaviour will be the opposite, that search and results are visibile while the error field is hidden.\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ruleConnection\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;conditionalRendering\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;e2dd8ff0-f8f1-11eb-b2bc-5b40a942c260\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;selectedFunction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;isFalse\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inputParams\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;userAuthorized\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;selectedAction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Show\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selectedFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;e2dd68e0-f8f1-11eb-b2bc-5b40a942c260\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;errorBoks\u0026#34; } }, \u0026#34;e2dd8ff0-f8f1-11eb-b2bc-5b40a942c261\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;selectedFunction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;isFalse\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inputParams\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;userAuthorized\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;selectedAction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hide\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selectedFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;e2dd68e0-f8f1-11eb-b2bc-5b40a942c261\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sokeBoks\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;e2dd68e0-f8f1-11eb-b2bc-5b40a942c262\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;resultatBoks\u0026#34; } } } } } Add text resources\nIn addition to the name of the service, three text resources have been added.\nThe text resource for error messages contains a placeholder for the name of the user. The variable errorMessage will be populated in the data model when it is registered that the user lacks the authorization to access the service.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ErrorMessage\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{0} mangler rettigheter til å bruke denne tjenesten.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variables\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;key\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;errorMessage\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dataSource\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dataModel.lookup\u0026#34; } ] }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Result\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Resultat\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SearchString\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Legg inn søkeord her:\u0026#34; }, Implement authorization logic\nAll data processing for stateless applications is located in the file App\\logic\\DataProcessing\\DataProcessingHandler.cs, and it is also where the authorization logic should be placed.\nLogic for looking up data and authorizing the user is handled in the method ProcessDataRead. It is called every time a user opens the application or inputs any data.\npublic async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataRead(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data)\r{\rlookup lookup = (lookup)data;\r// Check if user is authorized to use service\rParty party = await _register.GetParty(int.Parse(instance.InstanceOwner.PartyId)); if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(party.OrgNumber) || !await _finanstilsynet.HasReqiuiredLicence(_settings.LicenseCode, party.OrgNumber))\r{\rlookup.userAuthorized = false;\rlookup.errorMessage = $\u0026#34;{party.Name}\u0026#34;;\rreturn true;\r} // logic for looking up data\rif (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(lookup.searchString))\r{\rlookup.result = $\u0026#34;You typed \\\u0026#34;{lookup.searchString}\\\u0026#34;. This is the result.\u0026#34;;\rreturn true;\r}\rreturn false;\r} The method starts with logic for collecting form data for future use in the method.\nlookup lookup = (lookup)data Then comes the logic for checking if the user is authorized.\n// Check if user is authorized to use service Party party = await _register.GetParty(int.Parse(instance.InstanceOwner.PartyId)) if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(party.OrgNumber) || !await _finanstilsynet.HasReqiuiredLicence(_settings.LicenseCode, party.OrgNumber)) { lookup.userAuthorized = false; lookup.errorMessage = $\u0026#34;{party.Name}\u0026#34;; return true; } To know the identity of the user, the identificator instance.InstanceOwner.PartyId is used, this is used as an input for the method. We use Altinns register to collect the party-object which represents the user. It can contain either an organization or a person.\nParty party = await _register.GetParty(int.Parse(instance.InstanceOwner.PartyId)) Two checks are done to decide the authorization of a user. First it is verified that the party object has a defined organization number, if this is not the case and the user is not representing an organization they are not authorized.\nThe other check calls _finanstilsynet.HasReqiuiredLicence(), a method which looks up the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway\u0026rsquo;s API to decide if an organization has been given a license. The implementation of that service is available [here]her.\nIf none of the checks are successful two fields in the data model are populated;\r- an indicator that the user is not authorized\r- an error message, with only the name of the user\rAnd `true` is returned to indicate that the data values have been updated.\r```cs\rlookup.userAuthorized = false;\rlookup.errorMessage = $\u0026quot;{party.Name}\u0026quot;;\rreturn true;\r```\rFinally the logic to display the results based on the query string.\r```cs\r// logic for looking up data\rif (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(lookup.searchString))\r{\rlookup.result = $\u0026quot;You typed \\\u0026quot;{lookup.searchString}\\\u0026quot;. This is the result.\u0026quot;;\rreturn true;\r}\rreturn false;\r```\r`lookup.result` is populated with the value from the lookup, in this case we just write the query string back to the user.\rAgain, `true` is returned to indicate that a data value has been changed, and `false` if this is not the case.\rStarting an instance from a stateless form This is brand new functionality. Setup must be completed manually until further notice and will not be supported in Altinn Studio.\nNote: To make use of this functionality you must use version \u0026gt;= 4.17.2 of the nuget packages Altinn.App.PlatformServices, Altinn.App.Common og Altinn.App.Api.\nIn a stateless application you have the opportunity to use the InstantiationButton component to start an instance. Currently we only support starting an instance from within the same application the stateless form is displayed in. Starting an instance in another application is functionality we will add in the future.\nThere is an example stateless application where the end user can choose to start an instance in the actual application. It can be used as inspiration for further development. The application with source code can be found here\nInstantiation with prefill An example use case for starting an instance from a stateless application could be an app where the user is presented some given data at first. From this information the user can choose to act on the listed data, and then continue using the service as a normal form.\nTo achieve this type of flow you are dependent on setting up your application as a stateless application, described under configuration. When this has been done, you can expand the stateless view to include InstantiationButton which can start a new instance when the user clicks the button. Standard behaviour for this button is to submit the entire data model that the user has used as a part of the instantiation under the field prefill. If one wishes to pick parts of the data model which are connected in the stateless step it will also be possible to add mappingto the InstantiationButton component. For example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;instantiation-button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;InstantiationButton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Start instans\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;mapping\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;some.source.field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;some.other.field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;id\u0026#34; } } When the user then chooses to start an instance the app frontend will gather the fields some.source.field and some.other.field from the data model in the stateless step and map these fields to name and id which are sent with the instantiation call for the application. Example request which will be sent to the backend which can be mapped to the data model used in the submit part of the application:\n{ \u0026#34;prefill\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Ola Nordmann\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12345\u0026#34; }, ... } This prefill value can then be used in the method DataCreation in InstantiationHandler.cs to map against the fields that are needed as a part of the submittance part of the application during instantiation. Example:\npublic async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { if (data.GetType() == typeof(MessageV1)) { string name = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; string id = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; if (prefill.ContainsKey(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;)) { name = prefill[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;]; } if (prefill.ContainsKey(\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;)) { id = prefill[\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;]; } MessageV1 skjema = (MessageV1)data; skjema.Sender = name; skjema.Reference = id; } await Task.CompletedTask; } Intantiating from a repeating group If in the stateless step wanted the user to, for example, pick an element from a repeating group to continue on the chosen element, you can set up the InstantiationButton component as a part of the repeating group. Here you can then configure the instantiation button to map fields from the given index the user chose to start an instance from. This requires setting up mapping fields with an index on the actual group. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;instantiation-button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;InstantiationButton\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Start ny instans\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;mapping\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;people[{0}].name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;people[{0}].age\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;age\u0026#34; } } In the repeating group {0} will be replaced with the actual index of the group the user wishes to start from.\n"

To override this in your deployment/values.yaml you add it as a child to the deployment section:\ndeployment: replicaCount: 3 Note the addition of \"deployment:\" and that the \"replicaCount\" is indented with two spaces (yaml-indents are spaces and not tab, your yaml will not be valid with tab indents!)\rScale Initial scale The initial scale is controlled by the field replicaCount.

The containers will be orchestrated by Kubernetes.\nThe Altinn App is deployed as sets of Docker Containers defined as Kubernetes Deployment. The deployment will be in the organisation\u0026rsquo;s own Kubernetes Cluster.\nAll organisations will have their own Kubernetes Cluster.\nEach set of Kubernetes Deployment will be scaled based on the usage of the app. Scaling of the Deployment will be configurable in the Kubernetes Deployment and automatically scaled using Kubernetes Replicaset.\nKubernetes Clusters and Altinn Apps can do horizontal autoscaling. It is currently not decided if and how autoscaling will be used.\nThe Altinn App in Kubernetes will be configured as a Kubernetes Service which consist of the latest runtime application available when building the Altinn App and the Altinn App with related code and configuration.\nKubernetes Clusters per Organisation In Altinn Apps, every organisation will have their separate Kubernetes Cluster in each environment. The Kubernetes Cluster architecture will be the same in test and production environment This will support scaling tailored each organisations needs and separation of each organisation\u0026rsquo;s app.\nSecrets Pods, where the Altinn App are delpoyed, gets access to secrets during deployment via HELM charts.\nKubernetes Namespace It\u0026rsquo;s not planned to use namespaces.\nKubernetes Service Each Altinn App will be a Kubernetes Service.\nNetworking Sub domains Each organisation will have their own sub domain \u0026lt;org\u0026gt;.apps.altinn.no.\nPath for the Altinn App \u0026lt;org\u0026gt;.apps.altinn.no/\u0026lt;app\u0026gt;\nEncrypted traffic and network policy There is ongoing analysis related to this topic. Click here to find more information on Github.\nRouting / Ingress-Controller Routing in Kubernetes is handled by an Ingress-Controller called Traefik.\nTo be able to route traffic to the correct Kubernetes Service (Altinn App), each container is tagged to a specific Altinn App. The routing mecahnism routes to the correct Kubernetes Service based on the url containing the Altinn App parameter.\nAPI Proxy API Proxy is needed for controlling credentials and outbound firewall rules from the platform. This might be handled by the API Managment software. Needs Analyzis\nAPI Management The platform requires API management software to handle SLA ++.

This includes \u0026ldquo;Dotnet build\u0026rdquo; for C# files from Gitea. \u0026ldquo;Dotnet build\u0026rdquo; is executed on the Runtime Base Image reusing previous. Docker Pull: Altinn/Runtime Base Image with SDK from ACR. This makes the AltinnApp build faster. Clone and build code from Gitea inside Altinn-Runtime Base Image. Docker Pull: Microsoft/DotNet AspNetCore. Copy Altinn Runtime, AltinnApp Build files and App Metadata/Resources from Gitea. Publish to ACR. The build and deploy app pipeline is controlled by different flags :\nAPP_COMMIT_ID - used as id for the app image and should be used to reference the repository at that commit state APP_DEPLOY_TOKEN - used to identify user when cloning repository (is only really necessary for private repositorys but is mandetory) APP_ENVIRONMENT - represent which environment to deploy to (not yet used) APP_OWNER - the owner of the repository APP_REPO - the name of the repository to clone and use to create the app GITEA_ENVIRONMENT - the gitea environment to clone the repository from should_build - flag that can be used if one only wishes to deploy a app and not build it (default set to true) should_deploy - flag that can be used if one wishes to deploy an app (default set to false) Triggered by:\n\u0026ldquo;Deploy\u0026rdquo;-button in Altinn Studio. Manual deployment of Altinn App A manual deployment of the Altinn App requires access to you Kubernetes Cluster and knowledge about Helm.\nIf you want to configure the Helm chart and do a manual deployment you can find the Helm chart in your repo in the \u0026ldquo;deployment\u0026rdquo; folder.\nPlatform Cluster The platform cluster in Altinn Studio Apps will host common application like DataServices.\nPlatform integration The platform integration is a new application hosted in the existing infrastructure. It exposes REST-APIs for Profile, Register, Authorization, Intermediary and Authentication. These are services not part of the Altinn Platform (yet) and everyone planning to run the Altinn Platform would need to implement their own components that support.

	"content": "Launched functionality For information on How to use the functionalities described here, see the Altinn Studio and API user documentation.\nGUI based app development In the Altinn Studio GUI you can do the following:\nCreate (and retrieve) an app Upload a data model Add and edit texts Create a simple form (one or more pages), which links elements, texts and data model Add and edit rules for dynamics (Note! Coded as JavaScript) Deploy app to test and production environments Code based app development By downloading the app code (through Git) locally (or by editing the app files in the repository view) you can do a wide variety of changes to the app. This includes standard functionality for:\nMaking rules for validation and calculation Add prefill Add lookup to external APIs Edit the process/workflow of the app Edit the authorisation rules for the app, and make custom logic for instantiating Make custom events Test locally Once you have your app code locally, you can also take advantage of a local test enviroment for most types of app testing.\nIntegration with app owner Altinn 3 has standardised APIs that the app owner can use to upload and download data. For downloading Altinn 3 relies on the app owner polling for information and downloading data (pull). In addition app owner can use the app APIs to instantiate or change the data and/or status for instances.\nYou can reduce the amount of polling by using push events - where app owner can be notified when there is data available for download (Q2 2021) (#4728) ✔️\nTo use the APIs as an app owner, you need to authenticate using Maskinporten.\nMaintaining apps App owners get access to monitoring their apps, so they can keep track of how they are functioning. See also the pages about app maintenance.\nLet developers easily copy an old app into a new one (Q3 2021) (#5923) ✔️ Upcoming functionality Altinn 3 is in constant development, and functionality is released continuously. The backlog is revised eight times a year, and minor changes may occur between these revisions. In general, the further into the future a functionality is planned, the less certain the time frame is for said functionality.\nChanges described in italic are regarded as ideas, and if they are to be developed has not yet been decided.\nGUI based app development For all upcoming functionality, we assess if it\u0026rsquo;s suitable for solving i the GUI. At some point (2023 or later) we will intensify the effort to make more functionality available through GUI.\nSupport branching in Altinn Studio (Q4 2021) (#985) Data modelling The dependency on data modelling having to be done in an external tool will be removed. Some highlights from the plans for data modelling in Altinn 3 is:\nTo work with a data modeli in a GUI (Q4 2021) (#5551) Integrations with Felles datakatalog (Q1 2022) (#3811) To get an auto-generated data model from the app GUI you build To get an auto-generated draft for an app GUI from the data model Maintaining apps We wish to make app owners able to maintain their apps themselves in Altinn 3. To achieve this we will (among other things):\nMake it possible to decomission an app (Q4 2021) (#3717) Add a Web analysis tool for the apps Integration with app owner Pull of data will stay as the main pattern for downloading data as an app owner, but a few exceptions will come:\nPossibility to use eFormidling as an interface to get data sent from Altinn to app owner (Q4 2021) (#4788) Split of data - multiple app owners can receive data from the same app (Q3 2022) (#4274) "

Since Altinn Platform will in the future support applications created by different frameworks (Java/.NET/Node.js, ++) it is important that the authentication mechanisms are supported by different types of platforms.\nJSON Web Token are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties and are chosen as the bearer of information about users and systems.\nThe JWTToken is created in an asymmetric process where the Authentication component will use a private key from a certificate to sign the token, and the different apps and components that needs to verify it will use the public key. See JWT Format for details on the algorithm used.\nThe illustration below show how JWT flows between the different parts of the solutions.\nDownload as Visio.\nEnd user using app frontend For end user accessing the app through browser that loads app frontend, the authentication mechanism is based on using a protected cookie containing a JWT Token. ( HttpOnly and Secure)\nThe reason for putting the JWT token in the cookie for this scenarious is to protect against XSS attacks.\nIf the REACT application stored the JWT token as part of browser memory (REDUX), XSS attacks could potential expose those tokens. When storing the tokens in secure cookies those tokens are not available to any JavaScript code running in the browser.\nThe cookie with the JWT token is created by Authentication component in the Altinn Platform solution.\nThe React application would need to refresh the token at given interval or the token will expire. To refresh a cookie token, the token API in Platform needs to be called.\nOrg systems accessing app and Platform APIs Org (the entity owning the application) will have seperate API\u0026rsquo;s in a spp to perform operations on. They are authenticated with help of agency system id + password. A API in the authentication component in Altinn creates a JWT token that can be used to authenticate the agency system when calling api\u0026rsquo;s on apps running in Altinn Apps.\nSee Authentication API for details.\nEnd user systems accessing app APIs This solutions is yet to be finalized. The assumption is that the either the organization that own the system is authenticated and have a jwt token containing the organization number for that given organization or that the user using the system is authenticated and the systems send user token with request.\nThis is analyzed in #3291 and #237.\nAuthentication of users in Altinn Apps against Altinn Platform Applications hosted in a Altinn Apps solution would in many cases need to authenticate the end user against the different Altinn Platform components.\nThe solution for this is that the Apps would forward the JWT Token from the bearer token or JWT Cookie to the component that is called. This would be forwarded as a bearer token in the Authorization header in the request against the component.\nThis makes it possible to configure JWTCookie authentication mechanismen to authenticate the end user also in the components.\nAuthentication of Altinn Studio against Altinn Platform To make sure it is only allowed for a Altinn Studio environment to deploy and update applications the calls from designer to platform is authenticated with a access token generated by Designer.\nSee more details in AccessToken.\nAuthentication of Apps and components against Altinn Platform Some components like Register and Profile is limited to be used only by the apps deployed to Altinn Apps or other components in Altinn Platform\nTo be able to enforce this the platform components requires a Access Token identifying the app/component that is calling the Platform component. Each org has their own certificate avaialble in their Kubernetes Cluster.\nThe apps deployed to this cluster has access to this certifcate and generates a JWT token with the needed claims. The platform components has access to the public part of the certificate and are able to validate it.\nSee more details in AccessToken.\nAccess Token\rA additional access token are used in the scenarious where we need to authenticate the application or component callin a component in Altinn Platform.\nAuthentication APIs\rDescription of the Authentications API in Authentication Component\nJWT Format\rDescription of the JWT Format used in Altinn Studio, Altinn Platform and Altinn Apps.\nOIDC Providers\rAltinn Authentication support configuration of multiple OIDC Providers\n"

This cookie is a propiaritary format for ASP.NET (Full Framework) and can only be understood with application based on .NET Framework having access to the symmetric encryption key.\nThe Altinn Platform is based on .ASP.NET Core and can`t understand the cookie.\nTo allow for a user accessing an App in Altinn Apps or a component in Altinn Platform the current platform will expose an API that can decrypt an ASP.NET cookie and return user information to the Authentication component in Altinn Platform.\nToken exchange for maskinporten Organizations authenticated in maskinporten can exchange their JWT token for a valid Altinn Platform JWT token to be used against Altinn Apps and Altinn Platform.\nToken exchange for ID-porten End users authenticated through ID-porten can exchange their JWT token for a valid Altinn Platform JWT token to be used agains Altinn Apps and Altinn Platform.\nArchitecture See the application solution components for details about the functional components in authentication.\nThe application construction components for details how this component is constructued.\n"

	"content": "As part of the authentication component, there is some APIs that support authentication of different types of users and systems.\nAPI for SBL Authentication cookie This API creates a JWT Cookie (A cookie with a JWT Token) based on the SBL Cookie created during login in the Legacy SBL solution. This API uses API in the SBL Bridge to verify the cookie and get information about the logged-in user.\nBased on this information this API creates a JWT token with claims about the user (userid, authentication level ++) and sign the JWT token with the private key of Altinn Platform.\nThe login process for a user that wants to access an app in Altinn Apps is described below.\nDownload as Visio.\nExchange API for tokens Altinn supports tokens from different ID-providers, and in the future, it is expected that the list of supported ID-providers will grow.\nTo reduce complexity and increase performance the clients need to exchange the external tokens for an Altinn token.\nIn this way, the different apps do not need to know about all ID-providers and are not required to look up org identification or Altinn userId/partyId that is added to the Altinn token.\nExchanging ODIC token from ID-porten Altinn supports end-users logging in with OIDC in their end user system. (local installation or cloud-based).\nThe end-user-system gets an ID-token and a access-token from ID-porten. This is documentet at ID-porten.\nThe access token is exchanged in the API to an Altinn JWT token containing the needed attributes like userId\nExchanging token from MaskinPorten To authenticate a system like this Altinn Platform requires that the system is registered as a client in Maskinporten for a given org. The org needs also to be given scopes that matches the scopes for the API requested in Maskinporten.\nThis will be given by Altinn to the org.\nThe org system should be given the scope needed by the administrator of org. (done through Maskinporten API described here)\nThe org system would need to request a access token from Maskinporten with the correct scope. This token will be used in the org API in Authentication component in the Altinn Platform to create a new JWT token that can be used for all org apis in Apps and platform.\nDuring the verification process of the Maskinporten JWT token the scope and org is verified.\nDuring this process the Maskinporten token is exchanged to a Altinn token containing information about the authenticated org. This increases performance since org information does not need to be looked up for each request and the different apps and platform components would not need to know about all the different ID-providers supported by Altinn.\nThe below sequence diagram show how this will happen:\nDownload as Visio.\n"

	"description": "The Altinn 3 platform has very powerful and flexible authorization capabilities.",
	"content": "The authorization capabilities are based around ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Controls) and the XACML 3.0 standard.\nThese capabilities include:\nThe capability to define wide/narrow authorization policies for apps. Rules can be valid for the whole application or only valid for a subset of resources. The capability to evaluate policies based on a request for a resource The capability to configure authorization policies for API endpoints The capability to enforce decision request (permit or deny) The capability to enrich decision request with needed information The capability to retrieve context information from different sources both regarding resources accessed and subjects doing that. The capability to authorize based on API scopes Main Concept The following concepts are important\nAuthorization Components The authorization capabilities are provided by the following solution components\nPAP - Policy Administration Point: Where the authorization policies are defined PDP - Policy Decision Point: Where the authorization request is evaluated PEP - Policy Enforcement Point: The component making sure the user/system is authorized before accessing resources PIP - Policy Information Point: Components giving information to PDP about resources and subjects PRP - Policy Retrieval Point: Where the PDP can find the correct policy to use for a request Context Handler - Component adding context information to the decision request so PDP can evaluate a decision request correctly. These components are described in detail under solution components\nRights In Altinn Apps/Platform a right is permission to act on a given resource. The action performed can be one of some predefined options like read, write and sign but can also be any other action defined on a custom API in the apps. The resource is typical an app instance or part of it where data belongs to a given party (person or organization).\nA user or system gets a right based on rules that describe permissions based on being a specific user or having a specific role.\nPolicy A policy defines one or many rules for a given set of resources. This policy is described as an XACML 3.0 Policy document.\nRule An authorization rule in the Altinn Platform defines who has been given the right to perform actions on a given resource. A rule consists of 5 elements\nResource This describes which resource the rule applies for. Altinn Apps currently supports the following resource types in rules.\nOrg - Unique identifier of the organization responsible for the app. App - Application identifier which is unique within an organization. Task - A specific task in the process defined for an app Appresource - A resource for an instance/app that is not mapped to a task. Example: events Some of the resource types are meant to be used in combination. As an example, you can have been given the right for an app for a given reportee\nSubject The subject in an authorization rule identifies who the rules apply for. In Altinn Apps/Platform the resource can be the following.\nRoleType org When delegating is supported this would be expanded with\nuserid partyid keyroleforpartyid Action The Action part of the rule defines what type of action that the subject can perform on the resource.\nCurrently, the actions relevant for Altinn Apps and Altinn Platform are listed below. This list will increase over time.\nRead Write Sign Confirm Delete Condition The condition part of the rule is extra conditions that need to be fulfilled for the rule to be valid. In Altinn Studio we have the following types of conditions.\nValid To Obligation An obligation is an obligation that needs to be followed if the user is permitted or denied. In Altinn Apps/Platform this is used to define the minimum authentication level.\nCreation of policies The policies in Altinn Studio Apps is defined when the app developer defines the rules for the app. The policy is deployed together with the App to a given Altinn Studio App environment. See details in Policy Administration Point in Altinn Studio.\nIn Altinn II end users can also create policies/rules. This happens when:\nWhen the user creates a local role that contains rights that users have through other roles When delegating single rights to a user or organization. The rules is slightly different since rules defined by the end user have different subjects and can be defined for a more limited resource.\nThis will be supported in Altinn 3. See Github issue 1258\nAltinn Studio policy/rules User defined policy/rules Roles Altinn Studio Apps will retrieve roles from Altinn II Administration. This will later could be expanded to other sources for roles.\nScopes API Scopes are used in the solutions in some uses cases where organizations are authenticated through the external ID-Provider \u0026ldquo;MaskinPorten\u0026rdquo; or when end users are accessing the apps through end-user-systems.\nThe scopes are used to control what the user can do on behalf of the user/organization.\nScopes are always used together with the authorization rules for the specific app.\nDefined Scopes altinn:instances.read : Give system the right to access API for reading instances altinn:instances.write : Give system the right to access API for writing to instances altinn:serviceowner/instances.read : Give orgs the right to access API for reading instances altinn:serviceowner/instances.write : Give orgs the right to access API for writing to instances The Future The below show the future of Authorization Component.

The automatic backups are taken without affecting the performance or availability of the database operations. All the backups are stored separately in a storage service, and those backups are globally replicated for resiliency against regional disasters.\nAzure Cosmos DB automatically takes a backup of your database every 4 hours and at any point of time, only the latest 2 backups are stored. However, if the container or database is deleted, Azure Cosmos DB retains the existing snapshots of a given container or database for 30 days.\nThis functionality is out of the box when using Azure Cosmos DB.\nThis backup would only be relevant to use if all data is lost from Cosmos DB.\nCustom backup with help of Azure Function To support recovery of single or group of documents we needed to create a custom backup mechanismen.\nFor this we use the change feed that Azure Cosmos DB expose.\nChange feed support in Azure Cosmos DB works by listening to an Azure Cosmos container for any changes.

The changes are persisted, can be processed asynchronously and incrementally, and the output can be distributed across one or more consumers for parallel processing.\nThe solution is to have a Azure Function that listens to the change feed\nand copies documents from Cosmos DB when they are created or modified to a blob storage.\nThe blob storage is a shared blob storage for all orgs. (The same way Cosmos DB is shared) The blob storage have enabled soft delete. All versions of a document in Cosmos should be written to the same blob. Soft delete will keep track of all versions.\nThe following collections has a Azure Function that takes backup. Click on name for code details about Azure Function\nApplications DataElements InstanceEvents Instance Texts The below images show how the documents are backed up in a blob storage and soft delete has created a snapshot that last for 90 days. In theese 90 days we are able to recover the document to an earlier version.\nBlob storage Each org has their own separte storage account with a blob storage to store data for applications. In addition Altinn Platform has a shared blobstorge where metedata like XACML is stored for the different Apps.\nTo protect against unwanted deletion or changes we have enabled soft delete.\nWhen enabled, soft delete enables you to save and recover your data when blobs or blob snapshots are deleted. This protection extends to blob data that is erased as the result of an overwrite.\nWhen data is deleted, it transitions to a soft deleted state instead of being permanently erased. When soft delete is on and you overwrite data, a soft deleted snapshot is generated to save the state of the overwritten data.\nFor Altinn we have 90 days retention period. Inside that periode we can recover a blob to an earlier version.\nSee more about soft delete on Azure Documentation.\nRecovery Altinn ReStorage is a command-line interface application that enables operators to retrieve version history and metadata about elements as well as restore and undelete them.\nCurrently it supports restoring data elements. Further functionality is defined in this epic on GitHub.\n"

BPMN 2.0 supports defining collaboartion between two or more collaborators. BPMN 2.0 XML Extensibility In the formal specifications chapter 8.2.3 the following is described:\nThe BPMN metamodel is aimed to be extensible. This allows BPMN adopters to extend the specified metamodel in a way that allows them to be still BPMN-compliant.\nIt provides a set of extension elements, which allows BPMN adopters to attach additional attributes and elements to standard and existing BPMN elements.\nThis approach results in more interchangeable models, because the standard elements are still intact and can still be understood by other BPMN adopters. It’s only the additional attributes and elements that MAY be lost during interchange.\nWhen extended the BPMN XML is still understood by other BPMN adopters, but the additional attributes and elements MAY be lost during interchange.\nTesting different BPMN software packages shows that the extended attributes in the XML does not show up as configurable properties in other software.

They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.\nFeature Branches Development is done on feature branches with short lifespans before PR is requested against the master branch.\nThe figure below illustrates\nA feature branch with three commits Pull request is create with QA and merge back to master A new commit (forth green circle) based on feedback from QA Merge back to master Pull Requests A pull request (PR) is created to perform quality assurance (QA) and to merge a feature branch into master. You create a pull request after you have pushed your branch to our github repo.\nInclude a reference to the issue that triggered the pull request (Fixes #issuenumber) Once a pull request is submitted against our master branch it triggers various pipelines, such as builds, tests, static code analysis to ensure that code that breaks builds is not merged into master. These tests are triggered manually. Now that a PR has been submitted others may review your code and leave comments if they have feedback.\nOnce all the tests and QA have been completed we are ready to merge the new code into master. This is done using squash such that the history of the master branch is simple and understandable.\n"

The requred rule is documented here.\nUpdate path of Data Protection Keys for Apps #4483 changed the way we use data protection keys in order to improve the support for running locally. These keys are used in XSRF-protection. When you are running apps locally, we are using the default behaviour (directory under current user) for .Net Core. The path is passed with an environment variable when running in an apps cluster. This change requires the deployment.yaml file to be updated with the correct variable.\nThe change affects all application created in Altinn Studio before 30.09.2020 using Altinn.App.PlatformServices 1.1.8-alpha and above\nErrors User may experience errors posting data when the app is restarted or when multiple replicas are used.\nHow to fix You need to add the environment variable in the deployment.yaml file.

If no custom changes have been made to this file since you created the application, simply replace the content of the file with this code. The picture illustrates which changes are required in the file if you wish to do it manually, or inspect your code. Updated client-side validation - frontend v2 and Nuget v1.0.82-alpha Introduced with issue: #3944, and applies to existing apps that upgrade to the new major version of app frontend (v2).\nThe client-side validation of the app frontend has been replaced with a JSON-schema validation in order to provide a more complete client-side validation. As of v2 of app frontend, client-side validation has support for type-checking basic types, including enums. When upgrading the frontend version to v2, the app must use nuget versions 1.0.82-alpha or newer. See details below.\nIn order to implement this, we have made changes to how we bind the data model to fields in the forms.\nThe change is only breaking for apps using OR-type xsd (or have fields with `-`-character in xsd).\rMost Seres-type data models will not be affected, and will work without needing to make changes, even after updating to v2 of app frontend.\rIf you do experience any problems with submitting/validating form data even with a seres-type xsd, follow the steps below.\rErrors For apps that use an OR-type xsd (or have fields with --character in xsd), the app may crash during submission/validation because the data model binding used does not match the true path in the json schema (and xsd). This is because we have been using a simplified path previously, to match with the C# model. We have now changed that so that the data binding name corresponds to the true xpath for the field.\nHow to fix If using app frontend v2 or newer, make sure app is using nuget packages v1.0.82-alpha or newer.

Requests against these operations would work in AT environments, but would be broken by API Management in production like environments. The operations in question has now been removed and replaced with operations that require POST requests.\nErrors The methods that have been removed were used by an app when an instantiation were done by the Application owner. More specifically if the instanceOwnerPartyId were unknown. The instantiation request would then have the Person number or organization number instead, and the Register operation would be used to identify the correct party id.\nPOST https://{org}.apps.tt02.altinn.no/{app-id}/instances/ { \u0026#34;appId\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;org/app\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instanceOwner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;personNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12247918309\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organisationNumber\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;instanceOwnerPartyId\u0026#34;: null }, ... } How to fix Any issues related to this change can be fixed by upgrading to the latest version of Altinn.App.PlatformServices. This means the App must be updated and a the new version deployed to all environments. Existing instances are not affected.\nDeploy pipeline fails with error: UPGRADE FAILED Introduced with upgrade of AKS cluster.

This is because the dataType for the attachment expects application/octet-stream, but instead receives the actual mime type for the uploaded file.\nHow to fix Update allowedContentTypes for the data type that fails. This can either be done manually in the applications applicationMetadata.json for the affected data type(s) or by updating the FileUpload component in Altinn Studio so that the expected allowedContentTypes are saved.\nAfter updating, the app must be re-deployed.\nBuild fails after upgrading Altinn.App-nugets to version 1.0.62-alpha Introduced with issue: #3820.\nThe base class that every application inherits has been altered to allow for both data and task validation.\nError When building App.cs errors simillar to those depicted in the picture below are logged.\nHow to fix If you haven\u0026rsquo;t made any changes to App/logic/Validation/ValidationHandler.cs and App/logic/App.cs the quickest way to fix the build errors are to copy these files from the template and paste them into your repository. Find the template files here.\nIf changes have been made to these files, follow the instructions below to fix the errors.\nApp/logic/Validation/ValidationHandler.cs Add a reference to Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models by including the snippet below amongst the using statements. using Altinn.Platform.Storage.Interface.Models; Add the function below in the class. public async Task ValidateTask(Instance instance, string taskId, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { await Task.CompletedTask; } App/logic/App.cs Rename function RunValidation to RunDataValidation Add the function below in the class /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Run validation event to perform custom validations /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;validationResults\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Object to contain any validation errors/warnings\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;returns\u0026gt;Value indicating if the form is valid or not\u0026lt;/returns\u0026gt; public override async Task RunTaskValidation(Instance instance, string taskId, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { await _validationHandler.ValidateTask(instance, taskId, validationResults); } "

	"description": "Overview of breaking changes introduced into app nuget packages in v5.0.0.",
	"content": "1. PDF generation implementation moved out from AppBase/IAltinnApp All code related the generation of Pdf has been extracted from AppBase.cs and moved into PdfService.cs which in turn implements IPdfService. This opens up and allows us as service developers to replace the default Pdf implementation entirely.\nSince App.cs passes parameteres to AppBase.cs you need to remove thos no longer in use in the call to base(...) in the cosntructor:\nprocessService settings textService Your App constructor should then look something like this:\npublic App( IAppResources appResourcesService, ILogger\u0026lt;App\u0026gt; logger, IData dataService, IProcess processService, IPdfService pdfService, IProfile profileService, IRegister registerService, IPrefill prefillService, IInstance instanceService, IOptions\u0026lt;GeneralSettings\u0026gt; settings, IText textService, IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor) : base( appResourcesService, logger, dataService, pdfService, prefillService, instanceService, httpContextAccessor) It might be that you don\u0026rsquo;t use any of the removed services in you app code either, then you should remove those from the App constructor as well.\nIf you have implemented custom code to control Pdf generation, and depending on how you have done this, you have a couple options when it comes to what you need to do to resolve the breaking change. However the end result should be the same.\nCustom code in PdfHandler.cs\nThis is when you have added custom code in PdfHandler.cs. You should continue to use this class but it needs to implement an interface by following the steps below:\nMake sure the PdfHandler class implements the ICustomPdfHandler interface.\nNavigate to PdfHandler.cs and add : ICustomPdfHandler after the class name. The class should allready have the method defined in the interface. When adding the ICustomPdfHandlerinterface you also need to add a using statement using Altinn.App.PlatformServices.Interface;.\n/// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Handler for formatting PDF. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public class PdfHandler : ICustomPdfHandler { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Method to format PDF dynamic /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;example\u0026gt; /// if (data.GetType() == typeof(Skjema) /// { /// // need to create object if not there /// layoutSettings.Components.ExcludeFromPdf.Add(\u0026#34;a23234234\u0026#34;); /// } /// \u0026lt;/example\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;layoutSettings\u0026#34;\u0026gt;the layoutsettings\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;data\u0026#34;\u0026gt;data object\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; public async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { // Your code here return await Task.FromResult(layoutSettings); } } Register the PdfHandler implementation in Startup.cs\nAdd the following line\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;ICustomPdfHandler, PdfHandler\u0026gt;(); You should add it above the registration of your application\nservices.AddTransient\u0026lt;ICustomPdfHandler, PdfHandler\u0026gt;(); // Altinn App implementation service (The concrete implementation of logic from Application repository) services.AddTransient\u0026lt;IAltinnApp, AppLogic.App\u0026gt;(); Your custom implementation will now be injected into the PdfService implementation and be called during the Pdf generation process. When adding a custom PdfHandler you also need the using Altinn.App.AppLogic.Print; statement.\nCustom code in FormatPdf method\nThis the old way when you have your code directly in the overridden FormatPdf method in App.cs in your application.\npublic override async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { // You have code here... } Create a new class PdfHandler.cs and have it implement the ICustomPdfHandler interface\nMove your custom code to the FormatPdf method of the new class. You should then have a implementation similar to the example in step 1.1 above:\npublic class PdfHandler : ICustomPdfHandler { public async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { // Your code here return await Task.FromResult(layoutSettings); } } 2. Obsolete method GetOptionId removed from App/AppBase/IAltinnApp In version 4.24.0 we introduced a new way of supporting dynamic options making the GetOptionId methods in obsolete. The methods have now been removed and you should use the new way of implementing options as described in the documentation\nWhen you update you app you should then remove the following from App.cs as this method is removed from AppBase.cs:\n/// \u0026lt;inheritdoc /\u0026gt; #pragma warning disable CS0672 // Member overrides obsolete member public override Task\u0026lt;AppOptions\u0026gt; GetOptions(string id, AppOptions options) #pragma warning restore CS0672 // Member overrides obsolete member { return Task.FromResult(options); } 3. Obsolete method RunAppEvent removed from App/AppBase/IAltinnApp The RunAppEvent method is a old construct for hooking into various application events. This have been made obsolete by having concrete method overrides for each type of event as described in the documentation. The RunAppEvent method was passed in an AppEventType enum which specified the type of event that was fired. You would then need to have code checking the type and performing the logic needed. The table below shows the old enum values and their corresponding new methods that should be used instead.\nEnum Corresponding method Calculation RunProcessDataRead or RunProcessDataWrite Instantiation RunDataCreation ValidateInstantiation RunInstantiationValidation Validation RunDataValidation DataRetrieval RunProcessDataRead BeforeProcessChange OnStartProcess AfterProcessChange OnEndProcess AppModelCreation CreateNewAppModel The AppEventType.cs has been removed. This was referenced and used in App.cs - both the using reference and usage needs to be removed.\nDelete the following:\nusing Altinn.App.Common.Enums; and\n/// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Run app event /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;remarks\u0026gt;DEPRECATED METHOD, USE EVENT SPECIFIC METHOD INSTEAD\u0026lt;/remarks\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;appEvent\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The app event type\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;model\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The service model\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;modelState\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The model state\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;returns\u0026gt;True if the event was handled\u0026lt;/returns\u0026gt; public override async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; RunAppEvent(AppEventType appEvent, object model, ModelStateDictionary modelState = null) { _logger.LogInformation($\u0026#34;RunAppEvent {appEvent}\u0026#34;); return await Task.FromResult(true); } The RunAppEventmethod should be replaced with the appropriate methods as described above.\n4. Obsolete methods RunCalculation removed from AppBase/IAltinnApp In version 4.7.0 the RunCalculation method was replaced with the methods RunProcessDataRead and RunProcessDataWrite. RunCalculation has now been removed and those that have code in this method needs to move this to either RunProcessDataRead or RunProcessDataWrite.\nThe process to update is:\nAdd the DataProcessing folder and DataProcessingHandler class from our app template to your app. Update App.cs. Add a class field for DataProcessingHandler and copy new methods (RunProcessDataRead and RunProcessDataWrite) from App.cs Move logic from calculation handler to DataProcessingHandler Remove RunCalculation method from App.cs Remove CalculationHandler when code has been moved to DataProcessingHandler. Compile and test your app. "

Calculations does not have to be purely mathematical, they can also transfer values between fields, retrieve results from API calls and so on.\nCalculations are coded in C#, in the file CalculationHandler.cs. This file can be edited the easiest by downloading the source code of the app and editing it on your own computer, e.g. in Visual Studio Code. The data model with form data is available and can be edited/updated when needed.\nCalculations are run every time data is saved. With autosave on (default), calculations are run each time a user makes a change.\nIMPORTANT: When a calculation that has updated the data on the server has been run, the front-end must be notified so that the updated data can be loaded.\rTo do this, the `Calculate`-method must return `true` if any of the data has been updated.\rIf this is not done, the updated data will not be visible for the user until they reload the page.\rExample on code that replaces a given value (12345678) with another value (22222222) in a given field is shown below:\npublic bool Calculate(object data) { if (data.GetType() == typeof(Skjema)) { // Cast the data object to model type to access all fields Skjema model = (Skjema)data; // Get the existing value of a specified field, if it exists string tlf = model? .OpplysningerOmArbeidstakerengrp8819? .OpplysningerOmArbeidstakerengrp8855? .OppgavegiverTelefonnummerdatadef27335?.value; // Check if the value exists and is equal to \u0026#34;12345678\u0026#34; if (tlf != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; tlf == \u0026#34;12345678\u0026#34;) { // Replace the value in the field with a new value, \u0026#34;22222222\u0026#34; model .OpplysningerOmArbeidstakerengrp8819 .OpplysningerOmArbeidstakerengrp8855 .OppgavegiverTelefonnummerdatadef27335.value = \u0026#34;22222222\u0026#34;; // Return true to trigger a re-loading of data return true; } } // Return false if no changes have been made return false; } "

The number of nodes can vary between the different clusters. Microsoft recommends not to have less than three nodes in a single system node pool.\nSupported Kubernetes Versions The Kubernetes community releases minor versions roughly every three months. These releases include new features and improvements. Patch releases are more frequent (sometimes weekly) and are intended for critical bug fixes within a minor version. These patch releases include fixes for security vulnerabilities or major bugs.\nAKS supports the latest versions of Kubernetes.\nSee a list of Supported Kubernetes Versions.\nThe Altinn DevOps team upgrades the different Kubernetes Clusters.\nAzure Functions Apps Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs.

	"tags": [],
	"description": "An application can consume open and closed APIs available through the Internet.",
	"content": "ASP.NET Core has good opportunities to consume different types of API.\nThis can be useful if you want to expose your organization\u0026rsquo;s own APIs via an app or need help from external APIs in the application logic.\nOn this page, an example of using an external open API to enrich form data is presented. The example app is available in Altinn Studio.\nThe API used is RestCountries v3, and it\u0026rsquo;s the endpoint https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{country} we will use. The endpoint returns metadata about the provided country.\nYou may test the API in your browser and study the response: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/Norway.\nWe would like to enrich the form data with details about the country that the end user fills out.\nCreating models for the API If the API you are consuming is documented with Swagger or OpenAPI, you can easily generate C# classes based on the documentation.\nThis can be done manually, or by using available online tools.\nIn this example, the response object is quite large and contains much more data than we are interested in.\nHere is an abbreviated version of the response object for Norway\n[ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;common\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Norway\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;official\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Kingdom of Norway\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nativeName\u0026#34;: {} }, \u0026#34;idd\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;capital\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;Oslo\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;altSpellings\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;region\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Europe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subregion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Northern Europe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;languages\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;translations\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;latlng\u0026#34;: [ 62, 10 ], \u0026#34;landlocked\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;borders\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;area\u0026#34;: 323802, \u0026#34;demonyms\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;flag\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;🇳🇴\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maps\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;population\u0026#34;: 5379475, \u0026#34;postalCode\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;format\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;###\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;regex\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^(\\\\d{4})$\u0026#34; } } ] In the application we are only interested in the data in the highlighted lines, capital and region. We create a minimal response object that only contains the properties we are interested in.\nIn the folder App/models a new file Country.cs is created.\nusing System.Collections.Generic; namespace Altinn.App.models { public class Country { public List\u0026lt;string\u0026gt; Capital { get; set; } public string Region { get; set; } } } The Country object contains the fields Capital og Region. Capital is a list of strings as a country can contain multiple capital cities.\nIn this example, the API doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a complex request object, so we only need this one model. Should you need a seperate model for the request object, a class can be created the same way.\nSetting up an interface for the client It is reccomended that an interface if defined for the client what will call the API. This enables you to benefit from the strenghts of .NET with dependency injection and efficient handeling of HTTP clients.\nIn the application repository, a new folder App/clients is created. Within this folder, a new file ICountryClient.cs is created.\nThe interface consists of a single method GetCountry, which accepts a string and returns a Country-objekt.\nDefine the interface as shown below.\nusing System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.models; namespace Altinn.App.client { public interface ICountryClient { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Retrieves metadata about the provided country. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;country\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The name of the country\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;returns\u0026gt;A country object\u0026lt;/returns\u0026gt; public Task\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; GetCountry(string country); } } The return object is framed by Task\u0026lt;...\u0026gt;, this is added to support the asynchronous running of this method.\nImplement the client The client contains the code that makes the request towards the API and maps the response to the Country-model, which is what the methods using the client expect as an output.\nThe full implementation of CountryClient is shown below.\nusing System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Net.Http; using System.Text.Json; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.models; using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; namespace Altinn.App.client { public class CountryClient : ICountryClient { HttpClient _client; ILogger\u0026lt;ICountryClient\u0026gt; _logger; JsonSerializerOptions _serializerOptions; public CountryClient(HttpClient client, ILogger\u0026lt;ICountryClient\u0026gt; logger) { _logger = logger; _client = client; _client.BaseAddress = new Uri(\u0026#34;https://restcountries.com/v3.1\u0026#34;); _serializerOptions = new() { PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true }; } public async Task\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; GetCountry(string country) { string query = $\u0026#34;name/{country}\u0026#34;; HttpResponseMessage res = await _client.GetAsync(query); if (res.IsSuccessStatusCode) { string resString = await res.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); List\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; countryResponse = JsonSerializer.Deserialize\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(resString, _serializerOptions); return countryResponse.Any() ? countryResponse.First() : null; } else { _logger.LogError(\u0026#34;Retrieving country {country} failed with status code {statusCode}\u0026#34;, country, res.StatusCode); return null; } } } } At the top of the file you find a reference to all the namespaces the class depends on\nusing System; using System.Linq; using System.Net.Http; using System.Text.Json; using System.Threading.Tasks; using Altinn.App.models; using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; Further, we define the class and which interface it inherrits from\npublic class CountryClient : ICountryClient Further, three private object _client, __logger and _serializerOptions\nprivate readonly HttpClient _client; private readonly ILogger\u0026lt;ICountryClient\u0026gt; _logger; private readonly JsonSerializerOptions _serializerOptions; The underscore before the name is simply a naming convention and does not a functional effect.\n_client will be populated with an HTTP client in the constructor _logger will be populated with a logger, enabling logging error messages and other messages in the client logic _serializerOptions will be instantiated and configured in the contructor to support deserialization of the API response Further in the class, the constructor is defined\npublic CountryClient(HttpClient client, ILogger\u0026lt;ICountryClient\u0026gt; logger) { _logger = logger; _client = client; _client.BaseAddress = new Uri(\u0026#34;https://restcountries.com/v3.1\u0026#34;); _serializerOptions = new() { PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true }; } Objects are populated if there is mathcing input in the constructor, and the remaining objects are nstantiated directly in the constructor.\nIf you require additional services in this class, simply add a private object and inject its interface in the constructor ad we have done for _logger and _client.\nFurther, you find the implementation of GetCountry.\npublic async Task\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; GetCountry(string country) { string query = $\u0026#34;name/{country}\u0026#34;; HttpResponseMessage res = await _client.GetAsync(query); if (res.IsSuccessStatusCode) { string resString = await res.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); List\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; countryResponse = JsonSerializer.Deserialize\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(resString, _serializerOptions); return countryResponse.Any() ? countryResponse.First() : null; } else { _logger.LogError(\u0026#34;Retrieving country {country} failed with status code {statusCode}\u0026#34;, country, res.StatusCode); return null; } } Here, the status code of the API call is verified before it is deserialized and the country object returned. If the statusCode is not one that indicates success, a log entry is made and null is returned. Her gjøres det en sjekk på at statuskoden på API-kallet er en suksess-kode før vi deserialiseres og returnerer objektet. Dersom det ikke er en suksess-statuskode logger vi en feil og returnerer null.\nRegistering the client in the application Once the interface and client is implemented, it should be registerd in App/Program.cs (.NET 6) or App/Startup.cs (.NET 5), to make it available to use in the application.\nIn the method ConfigureServices, the line below is included\nservices.AddHttpClient\u0026lt;ICountryClient, CountryClient\u0026gt;(); Using the client in the application logic To enrich the form data we need to include the use of our client in the logic in the method ProcessDataWrite in App/logic/DataProcessingHandler.cs.\nFirst the client must me made available by injecting it in the constructor of the class. DataProcessingHandler does not have a constructor by default, so this needs to be created.\npublic DataProcessingHandler() { } Further, a private entry for the client, inject the client into the constructor and assign it to the private client instance. The result should look like this:\nprivate readonly ICountryClient _countryClient; public DataProcessingHandler(ICountryClient countryClient) { _countryClient = countryClient; } _countryClient is now available in DataProcessingHandler, and we\u0026rsquo;re ready to implement the logic in the ProcessDataWrite method.\npublic async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataWrite(Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { if (data.GetType() == typeof(skjema)) { skjema skjema = (skjema)data; if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(skjema.land)) { Country country = await _countryClient.GetCountry(skjema.land.Trim()); if (country != null) { skjema.hovedstad = string.Join(\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;, country.Capital); skjema.region = country.Region; } else { skjema.hovedstad = skjema.region = string.Empty; } return true; } else { skjema.hovedstad = string.Empty; skjema.region = string.Empty; } } return await Task.FromResult(false); } If you attempt to build the applicatin at this point, an error will occur. DataProcessingHandler is instansiated in App.cs, so all dependencies must be included in this file and included in the initialization of DataProcessingHandler.\nIn the file App/logic/App.cs, the following changes are made\nAdd a reference to the namespace of the client at the top of the file\nusing Altinn.App.client; Inject ICountryClient as the last element of the pp.cs-constructor.\nThis is done in line 14\n1public App( 2 IAppResources appResourcesService, 3 ILogger\u0026lt;App\u0026gt; logger, 4 IData dataService, 5 IProcess processService, 6 IPDF pdfService, 7 IProfile profileService, 8 IRegister registerService, 9 IPrefill prefillService, 10 IInstance instanceService, 11 IOptions\u0026lt;GeneralSettings\u0026gt; settings, 12 IText textService, 13 IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor, 14 ICountryClient countryClient) : base( 15 appResourcesService, 16 logger, 17 dataService, 18 processService, 19 pdfService, 20 prefillService, 21 instanceService, 22 registerService, 23 settings, 24 profileService, 25 textService, 26 httpContextAccessor) Include countryClient in the initialization ofDataProcessingHandler\n_dataProcessingHandler = new DataProcessingHandler(countryClient); Caching of respons data A drawback of the example as it now stands if that a request will be made to the API each time a piece of the form data i updated.\nIt is a reasonable assumption that a countries capital and region will not change frequiently. If information about Norway is retrieved, we can store this in the application for a period of time, so the cost of the request is saved.\nThe changes to the code are not described in detail, but the complete code is available below. All the modifications are made to the CountryClient.cs-file.\nusing Altinn.App.models; using Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory; using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Net.Http; using System.Text.Json; using System.Threading.Tasks; namespace Altinn.App.client { public class CountryClient : ICountryClient { private readonly HttpClient _client; private readonly ILogger\u0026lt;ICountryClient\u0026gt; _logger; private readonly JsonSerializerOptions _serializerOptions; private readonly IMemoryCache _memoryCache; private readonly MemoryCacheEntryOptions _cacheOptions; public CountryClient(HttpClient client, ILogger\u0026lt;ICountryClient\u0026gt; logger, IMemoryCache memoryCache) { _logger = logger; _client = client; _client.BaseAddress = new Uri(\u0026#34;https://restcountries.com/v3.1/\u0026#34;); _serializerOptions = new() { PropertyNameCaseInsensitive = true }; _memoryCache = memoryCache; _cacheOptions = new() { AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromHours(24) }; } public async Task\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; GetCountry(string country) { string uniqueCacheKey = \u0026#34;Country_\u0026#34; + country; // Check if country is present in cache, if so return from cache if (_memoryCache.TryGetValue(uniqueCacheKey, out Country outputCountry)) { return outputCountry; } string query = $\u0026#34;name/{country}\u0026#34;; HttpResponseMessage res = await _client.GetAsync(query); if (res.IsSuccessStatusCode) { string resString = await res.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); List\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt; countryResponse = JsonSerializer.Deserialize\u0026lt;List\u0026lt;Country\u0026gt;\u0026gt;(resString, _serializerOptions); if (countryResponse.Any()) { outputCountry = countryResponse.First(); // Add response country to cache _memoryCache.Set(uniqueCacheKey, outputCountry, _cacheOptions); return outputCountry; } else { return null; } } else { _logger.LogError(\u0026#34;Retrieving country {country} failed with status code {statusCode}\u0026#34;, country, res.StatusCode); return null; } } } } "

If a new major version is published you need to update your app to pull this new version, watch out for breaking changes)\nIf you want to lock the frontend to a specific version of app frontend (e.g. 1.2.3) you specify this directly in the URL that points to app frontend.\nUpgrade to new version / specific version The reference to app frontend is located in App/views/Home/Index.cshtml.\nYou need to update two references:\nReference to altinn-app-frontend.js-file which contains the code for app frontend. \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/\u0026lt;VERSIONNUMBER\u0026gt;/altinn-app-frontend.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Reference to altinn-app-frontend.css which contains the styling for app frontend. \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/toolkits/altinn-app-frontend/\u0026lt;VERSIONNUMBER\u0026gt;/altinn-app-frontend.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Search for the filename (àltinn-app-frontend.jsoraltinn-app-frontend.css`) and replace the version number (e.g. 1) with the desired version number (e.g. 2).\nReminder: If you depend on a major version (e.g. 2), every minor and patch version of this major release will be applied automatically. If a specific version is defined (e.g. 2.0.0) the application will fetch this version until the reference is updated and no fixes or improvements will be fetched.\nDeployment Deployments are defined with helm-charts. The standard deployment setup is fetched from altinn-studios helm repository if you leverage the latest deployment strategy (recommended).\nIf you unsure if your app leverages the latest deployment strategy you can follow the migration guide here\nTo find the latest version of the standard helm-chart you can either check for the latest release of the chart deployment here or add the helm repo locally and search for available version with these commands:\n# Add the altinn-studio helm repo helm repo add altinn-studio https://charts.altinn.studio # Search for version of altinn-studio/deployment chart helm search repo -l altinn-studio/deployment If there is a new version of the helm chart check the changelog to see what\u0026rsquo;s new in this release.\nTo update to the new version update the dependency reference in deployment/Chart.yaml\napiVersion: v1 description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes name: deployment version: 1.1.0 dependencies: - name: deployment repository: https://charts.altinn.studio/ version: 1.1.0 \u0026lt;--- Update this "

	"description": "How to add dynamics?",
	"content": "Introduction Dynamics are events that happen on the client side. These can be separated in two categories:\nCalculations - do calculations on the client side, and update the fields with new value. Show/hide fields - decide if fields should be hidden or displayed based on form values. There are two ways to add and change dynamics for an Altinn App:\nDirectly in Altinn Studio under Lage-tab. Select Rediger dynamikk in the right menu. In a local development environment by working in the file RuleHandler.js which can be found in the App/ui folder. All dynamics are written as Javascript functions in the RuleHandler file. Functions that are defined in this file can be configured to run for selected fields in the app.\nThe dynamic code to show/hide fields or perform calculations should be set up so that it handles possible errors in the input gracefully.\rIt should for instance handle empty fields or strings where you expect numbers without crashing.\rIf the dynamic does not work as expected, take a look at the code that defines the dynamic and verify that it handles errors.\rNOTE: in order to support dynamics in older browsers the code defined in `RuleHandler.js` must be written in the version of ECMA-script as the given browser supports.\rFor IE11 this is ECMA-script 5.\rAdd or edit functions for dynamics There are two javascript objects in the file RuleHandler.js:\nruleHandlerObject - functions for calculations conditionalRuleHandlerObject - functions for hiding/showing fields It is in these objects the functions should be defined. In addition to these there are two help objects (ruleHandlerHelper and conditionalRuleHandlerHelper), where you configure what input the different functions expect. This is done in order to be able to configure up rules in Altinn Studio at a later point. To be able to configure dynamics in studio the functions must be defined in the Javascript objects (ruleHandlerObject or conditionalRuleHandlerObject), and the parameters they expect in the corresponding helper object.\nThe structure of the help object:\nvar ruleHandlerHelper = { \u0026lt;name_of_rule\u0026gt;: () =\u0026gt; { return { \u0026lt;input_param\u0026gt;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;description\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026lt;input_param\u0026gt;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;description\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, \u0026lt;input_param\u0026gt;: \u0026#34;\u0026lt;description\u0026gt;\u0026#34; ... }; } } The structure of objects containing the javascript functions:\nvar ruleHandlerObject = { \u0026lt;name_of_rule\u0026gt;: (\u0026lt;input_variable_name\u0026gt;) =\u0026gt; { // Do something here // Values from input parameters defined in // helper can be accessed through the object passed // into the rule, f.ex. // \u0026lt;input_variable_name\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;input_param\u0026gt; } } For instance, to create a rule that calculates the sum of two numbers (calculation) the following code is needed:\nvar ruleHandlerHelper = { sum: () =\u0026gt; { return { field1: \u0026#34;Field 1 in sum\u0026#34;, field2: \u0026#34;Field 2 in sum\u0026#34; }; } } var ruleHandlerObject = { sum: (data) =\u0026gt; { // Check if data is available if (!data) return; // Check if value from input fields are available // If not, use value 0 in sum data.field1 = data.field1 ? data.field1 : 0; data.field2 = data.field2 ? data.field2 : 0; // return the sum return data.field1 + data.field2; } } Some default methods for calculations, with help objects, are defined as part of the app template.\nMethod name Description Parameters Defined in object/helper sum Returns the sum of two values value1, value2 ruleHandlerObject/ruleHandlerHelper fullName Combines two strings (first name and last name) separated with a space. firstName, lastName ruleHandlerObject/ruleHandlerHelper lengthGreaterThan4 Returns true if the value is longer than 4 chars long. value conditionalRuleHandlerObject/conditionalRuleHandlerHelper Dynamics are run if a change has occurred in the input fields connected to the rule. The functions have to handle cases where for instance only one of the two parameters have defined values.\nAn example of how this could be done is shown in the sum-function below, where missing values are corrected to the value 0.\nvar ruleHandlerObject = { sum: (obj) =\u0026gt; { obj.value1 = obj.value1 ? +obj.value1 : 0; obj.value2 = obj.value2 ? +obj.value2 : 0; return obj.value1 + obj.value2; }, fullName: (obj) =\u0026gt; { return obj.firstName + \u0026#39; \u0026#39; + obj.lastName; } } var ruleHandlerHelper = { sum: () =\u0026gt; { return { value1: \u0026#34;Value 1\u0026#34;, value2: \u0026#34;Value 2\u0026#34; } }, fullName: () =\u0026gt; { return { firstName: \u0026#34;First name\u0026#34;, lastName: \u0026#34;Last name\u0026#34; }; } } var conditionalRuleHandlerObject = { lengthBiggerThan4: (obj) =\u0026gt; { if (obj.value == null) return false; return obj.value.length \u0026gt;= 4; } } var conditionalRuleHandlerHelper = { lengthBiggerThan4: () =\u0026gt; { return { value: \u0026#34;value\u0026#34; } } } Configure dynamics for UI components Add the relevant UI components to the layout. In the right menu, select Regler for beregninger or Regler for vis/skjul felt. Select the wanted rule. Or add a function, as described in the sections above. Configure which field(s) that should be used as input for the function - this is fields in the data model. Select which component(s) that should be affected by the rule (recieve value or be shown/hidden) - this is components in the layout. For rules for hiding/showing elements several fields can be selected for the same rule. Save the configuration. Test that the rules works as expected. Existing configured rules is shown in the right menu, and can be edited/deleted.\nThe configuration can also be seen in the file App/ui/RuleConfiguration.json. This can be manually edited if necessary.\nExample usage of dynamics on an app Scenario:\nAn app with a UI with several fields for input. One of these fields is a radio button with the options \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo;. Depending on what the user selects, different content is to be displayed:\nYes: a new input field is shown, together with information on what is to be filled in. No: a different information text is shown. This can be solved by adding the following in RuleHandler.js, either through Rediger dynamikk in Altinn Studio, or by manually editing the source code.\nvar conditionalRuleHandlerObject = { sjekkVirksomhetIDrift: (obj) =\u0026gt; { return (obj.value \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.value === \u0026#34;Yes\u0026#34;); }, sjekkVirksomhetIkkeIDrift: (obj) =\u0026gt; { return (!obj.value || obj.value != \u0026#34;Yes\u0026#34;); } } var conditionalRuleHandlerHelper = { sjekkVirksomhetIDrift: () =\u0026gt; { return { value: \u0026#34;value\u0026#34; } }, sjekkVirksomhetIkkeIDrift: () =\u0026gt; { return { value: \u0026#34;value\u0026#34; } } } Here, two functions have been added which checks if the value is \u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026rdquo; or not. After this code is added, the rules can be configured in studio. The results are displayed below:\nDynamics in repeating groups It is also possible to add dynamics within a repeating group. This requires that the rule is configured in Altinn Studio as usual, and then manually doing some extra configuration in the App/ui/RuleConfiguration.json file as described below.\nFor each inputParams, one needs to add {0} after the group part of the data binding. For instance model.group{0}.field. The index indicator will be replaced by the index for each relevant field in the repeating group. For each selectedFields (the fields affected by the rule), one needs to add {0} after the field id, for instance layoutComponent{0} A new property must also be added to the rule, repeatingGroup. This object must contain the id of the relevant group in the layout file. An example of a rule that is configured for a repeating group:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ruleConnection\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;conditionalRendering\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;9f9f2a50-360b-11ea-b69a-8510e2e248b9\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;selectedFunction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;lengthBiggerThan4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inputParams\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;model.group{0}.field\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;selectedAction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Show\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selectedFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-field{0}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;second\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some-other-field{0}\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;repeatingGroup\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;groupId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;the-group-id\u0026#34;, } } } } } Nested repeating groups It is also possible to add dynamics for nested repeating groups. The configuration resembles that of repeating group, but a second parameter childGroupId is added in the repeatingGroupobject, as well as an extra index indicator.\nExample:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;ruleConnection\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;conditionalRendering\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;hide-nested-group-field\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;selectedFunction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;shouldHide\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;inputParams\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;someGroup{0}.nestedGroup{1}.someField\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;selectedAction\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Hide\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;selectedFields\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;field\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;the-component-id{0}{1}\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;repeatingGroup\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;groupId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;mainGroup\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;childGroupId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;subGroup\u0026#34; } } } } } Example with more complex dynamics Scenario: An app has two sets of radiobuttons (yes/no) and a checkbox.\nWhen the app is loaded, only the fist set of radiobuttons are visible. If the user selects Yes, the second set of radiobuttons are shown. If the user selects Yes in the second choice, the checkbox is shown. If the user goes back to the first set of radiobuttons and selects No, both the second set of radiobuttons and the checkbox is hidden. Alternative 1 This can be solved by configuring two different conditions for when the fields should be displayed:\nOne condition for the second set of radiobuttons Is shown if Yes is selected in the first set One condition for the checkbox Is shown when Yes is selected in both sets of radiobuttons. Example code that can solve this case:\nvar conditionalRuleHandlerObject = { showField2: (obj) =\u0026gt; { if (obj \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.field1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.field1=== \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) { return true; } return false; }, showField3: (obj) =\u0026gt; { if (obj \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.field1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.field1 === \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.field2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.field2 === \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) { return true; } return false; } } var conditionalRuleHandlerHelper = { showField2: () =\u0026gt; { return { field1: \u0026#34;Field 1\u0026#34; }; }, showField3: () =\u0026gt; { return { field1: \u0026#34;Field 1\u0026#34;, field2: \u0026#34;Field 2\u0026#34; }; } } Alternative 2 This can also be configured by using the same condition to show both the second set of radiobuttons and the checkbox. In addition a rule that removes the value from the second set of radiobuttons if the user selects No in the first set:\nvar ruleHandlerObject = { clearField: (obj) =\u0026gt; { if (obj \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.checkValue === \u0026#34;no\u0026#34;) { return \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; } return obj.currentValue; } } var ruleHandlerHelper = { clearField: () =\u0026gt; { return { checkValue: \u0026#34;check against this value\u0026#34;, currentValue: \u0026#34;the current value\u0026#34; } } } var conditionalRuleHandlerObject = { showField: (obj) =\u0026gt; { if (obj \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.checkField \u0026amp;\u0026amp; obj.checkField === \u0026#34;yes\u0026#34;) { return true; } return false; } } var conditionalRuleHandlerHelper = { showField: () =\u0026gt; { return { checkField: \u0026#34;check against this value\u0026#34; }; } } Dynamics in PDF From nuget versions 3.0.0 it is also possible to add dynamics for the PDF. This is done in the PDF Handler.

	"description": "This is the functionality available for end users in Altinn 3, and some of the larger planned changes.",
	"content": "Launched functionality For information on How to use the functionalities described here, see the app section of the documentation.\nForm functionality Support for apps where data is sent in. A variety of standard components to build with (ex. text field, radio button, checklist, date picker, attachment, repeating group of components), including putting these in a grid. Support for an app consisting of multiple pages, but the end user can only navigate forward and backward between the pages (controlled navigation). All forms and elements have a standardised look and feel.\nSupport for defining rules, including calculation, validation and dynamics on both element and page level (i.e. control what the user will see depending on what they enter in the form).\nThe elements are linked to texts and data model. Possibility to connect to APIs as data sources, and prefilling with data from Altinn\u0026rsquo;s copies of Folkeregisteret and Enhetsregisteret.\nWe also support stateless apps (#1328) ✔️\nApplication process You can combine different tasks in the order that\u0026rsquo;s relevant for the app:\nForm filling / message (data) - exposing data from app owner and/or collecting data from end user Confirmation (confirm) - the user should confirm that these are the data I want to submit Wait for feedback (feedback) - the process is not complete, but someone other than the user (app owner or third party) is the party that should act In addidtion we have an end stated for an instance being archived/complete.\nAuthentication and authorisation You can define which role(s) in Altinn that can access different operations on each task in the app process. The roles can either be Altinn specific roles, roles from Enhetsregisteret or that the app owner has access.\nIntegration with the Altinn message box The app instances are shown in the users message box in the same way as in Altinn 2. You can find the instances through search (albeit with a few limitations).\nYou can use presentation fields to discern instances of the same app apart (Q2 2021) (#594) ✔️\nThe app owner can decide what status is relevant for each instance. They can also decided that instances of an app should never be archived.\nIntegration with end user systems The apps have standardised APIs that can be used for submission from third party systems. Every app has its own end points. Authentication is done through ID-porten.\nUpcoming functionality Altinn 3 is in constant development, and functionality is released continuously. The backlog is revised eight times a year, and minor changes may occur between these revisions. In general, the further into the future a functionality is planned, the less certain the time frame is for said functionality.\nChanges described in italic are regarded as ideas, and if they are to be developed has not yet been decided.\nForm functionality It should be possible to define user interfaces that fit the needs of the individual app. Examples of upcoming functionality:\nMore freedom in navigating between pages (Q4 2021) (#5893) Editable tables (Q4 2021) (#378) Selecting language in an app (Q1 2022) (#2055). Denne endringen gjør det også mulig å tilby tjenester på andre språk enn bokmål/nynorsk/engelsk. Theming of the user interface (#2115) Application process We will expand the library of available task types to cover more use cases. Examples of upcoming functionality:\nFunctional signing (Q4 2021) (#5540) Technical signing (Q1 2022) Complex signing rules - e.g. based on what is filled in in the for and parallel signing (x out of y persons has to sign) (Q2 2022) (#1324) / (#1325) Payment (Q3 2022) (#1320) More freedom in moving between tasks (Q4 2021) (#2743) Obtaining concent from the user Authentication and authorisation In Altinn 3 we want to have at least the same level of flexibility for the users when it comes to how to grant and granulate access as we do in Altinn 2. This implies these (and possibly other) changes:\nSupport for delegating acces on app level (Q4 2021) (#2731) Support for delegating acces on instance level (Q4 2021) (#2732) Access to app with enterprise user (#3743) Whitelisting of relevant users for an app (#5547) Event driven apps To build complete service chains without a need for complex orchestration, it\u0026rsquo;s necessary that an app can \u0026ldquo;react\u0026rdquo; to events in another app or to external events. Facilitating this way of build service chains are in the plans for late 2022.\nNotifications (email and sms) Sending out notifications by email and/or sms is an integral part of some services. For now Altinn 3 will use the notification functionality inn Altinn 2.\nIt should be possible to connect notifications to various events in the app (Q1 2022) (#4275) The end user should be able to email a copy of the receipt (Q3 2022) (#1902) Integration with the Altinn message box Finding the right instance of a service in the message box should be simple. To achieve this we will add:\nSupport to create a new instance based on an excisting one (Q4 2021) (#1566) Check if the user already has an instance of the app in message box when going to the app, so they can chose if they want a new instance or continue the existing (Q4 2021) (#1811) Possibility to search the content of the apps (#5450) "

	"content": "The new generation of Altinn is moving to an event-driven architecture. In this context, this means that applications (digital services) running in Altinn Apps will publish events that application owners (agencies) and parties(citizens and businesses) can subscribe to and react to.\nThis page is focused on capabilities. If you are interested in more details about the components and construction see Event Solution Components and Event Construction Components.\nOverall Concept In Altinn there will over time be thousands of different digital services deployed to Altinn Apps. Those digital services will be accessed by the citizens and businesses in Norway.\nThey will receive and submit data to/from the entity that is responsible for the digital service and others using the platform. The event architecture would make it possible to get notified when there are events in the platform related to data that the different actors have an interest in. It could be anything from the digital service (app) owner being notified that a citizen has completed a form, to that the citizen is informed that there is a new form he needs to fill out.\nEvents Events would be a combination of standard events defined by the platform and custom events added in an application by application developers.\nThe events will typically only contain information about that an event has happened with a reference to some data that was changed because of that event.\nStandard app events\nAn instance is created An instance changes state (from one process task to another, example: data -\u0026gt; signing) An instance is completed Custom events could be\nA user has asked for a deduction in a form A specific validation of data failed Event attributes\nEvents would typically have some attributes used for filtering.\n[source] - This is the application that created the event. Currently, there are apps deployed to Altinn Apps [type] - The type of event. Created, completed [subject] - Who is the owner of the data related to the event. ++. Free text not locked to a schema. An event will contain a limited set of information. To get the full details for an event the consumer would need to get all details using APIs.\nEvent Producers Applications running in Altinn Apps Applications hosted in the Altinn Apps infrastructure would be the most common producer of events in the beginning.\nThe standard App template contains code for publishing standard events to the events component. The following standard events published by an app is\napp.instance.created : When a instance is created. app.instance.process.movedTo.{TaskId} : When a process is moved to a specific task app.instance.process.completed : When a process is complete The application template will contain API so logic in applications can publish events based on rules defined by the developer.\nThese app events could be anything, and could also be triggered by other external systems through custom APIs in the app.\nSee code example\nOther producers Altinn Events together with Altinn Authorization has the potential to be the national event hub for Norway.\nThe possibility to have Altinn Authorization to authorize access to events gives great possibilities not available from other event platforms.\nIn the future, several other Event producers could be added. Examples could be\nAltinn 2 ServiceEngine: Reducing the need for polling to the current platform Altinn 2 Authorization: Information about changes on rights National Register: Informing- Other agency specific applications Private sector applications about register changes Other national components Only the imagination limits whats is possible in the future. This is followed up in this issue.\nEvent consumers Orgs (application owners) Orgs will need to know about events happening in their apps in Altinn.\nFor some orgs there is a need for subscribing to events for a specific app, others might want to subscribe to all events, or maybe a specific type of event.\nParties (persons and organizations) Parties submitting and receiving data in Altinn would benefit from knowing about events. This could be feedback has been added to a form, or that a new message has been received.\nIn many cases, parties use professionals to handle their data in Altinn. These professionals typically have many hundred or thousands of clients.\nCurrently we only support persons and consumers. They need to be authenticated through ID-porten to set up a subscription for themself.\nBefore any event is pushed, the consumers access to the source of the event is authorized.\nRequirments The following requirements were identified for the new event architecture in Altinn 3.\nIt should be possible to subscribe to a specific type of event. (Example all app.instance.process.completed events for a given app) It should be possible to go at least 3 months back in history when searching for events through API. The consumer will keep track of which events the consumer has processed. The architecture should support more than 10 000 publishers. The architecture should support more than 1 000 000 consumers. The architecture should support more than 500 000 000 events a year. Access to events should be authorized. Accessing an event for a party requires that the consumer has the correct role Before pushing events to a subscriber endpoint the push functionality need to authorize the subscriber for the event See also Referansearkitektur for datautveksling\nEvent Principles and pattern During the analysis, the following principles and pattern has been applied\nSmall events The events will only contain a small amount of data. If more information is needed this is available from the resource itself Every event links to the resource affected by the event. We use CloudEvent as the format. Prefer push of events to consumers The preferred consumption of events is through subscription and subscriber endpoints where Altinn Events pushes the events to a subscriber webhook.\nSupport retry of push The push functionality needs to support retry of pushing events if the subscriber endpoint is unavailable.\nExpose events through REST-API The use of REST-API ensures low complexity for consuming events REST-API URLs and parameters are uses for filtering Consumers keep track of their status Consumers will keep track of their status when using events API for consumption of events. Events do not change Events for a resource are never changed. A new event can revert the effect of an earlier event Events are stored for a limited time Events will be available for 3 months through API. Event Architecture As part of the Altinn 3 solutions there is defined a event architecture to support the above requirements and capabilities.\nEvent Schema The Altinn 3 will use the defined CloudEvents specification to describe events in Altinn Apps and Altinn Platform.\nThe reason for choosing cloud events are\nIt is a standardized and open format as preferred by our architecture principles It backed by many and The specification is now under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation It is flexible so it would support scenarios in the future Below you find a offical example. See full JSON Schema\n{ \u0026#34;specversion\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;1.x-wip\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;com.github.pull.create\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;source\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/pull\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;subject\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;123\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;A234-1234-1234\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;time\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;2018-04-05T17:31:00Z\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;comexampleextension1\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;comexampleothervalue\u0026#34; : 5, \u0026#34;datacontenttype\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;text/xml\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;data\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;\u0026lt;much wow=\\\u0026#34;xml\\\u0026#34;/\u0026gt;\u0026#34; } specversion: The version of the CloudEvents specification which the event uses.

Examples: instance.created, instance.process.paymentcompleted, instance.process.completed source: Describes what the event is related to. Will be used to filter event types. For an app it would typical be /{org}/{app}/{partyId}/{instanceGuid}. This would be used for consumers to look up a given instance. subject: The party the event is related to. PartyID is used. id: Unique id for a given event. time: The time the event was triggered. Set by the publisher. datacontenttype: Optional. Content type of data value. This attribute enables data to carry any type of content, whereby format and encoding might differ from that of the chosen event format data: Optional. Can contain a structure of data specific for an event type. In addition to the spec there is added alternativesubject as an extension to the event model. This will be used for socical secuirty number, organization number or other identifier in addition to the partyId found in subject property.\nCurrently this can be\nfnr : social security number (11 digits) org: organization number (9 digits) The value will be prefixed\nExample 1 A instance has been created for a given party.

This delegation is done through Maskinporten.\nDelegating party event access In general, access to events for a given party will be authorized based on roles the requesting organization/user have for the subject of the event.\nEvent Analytics With a new event architecture it is possible imagine that we can run analytics on the events to give important insight in to the data in the platform.\nExample\nHow many instances is created for the different applications How long time does each task take to complete Is there any relationship between apps. This is analyzed in the following issue\nAltinn Platform Events as a national event hub The event capabilities in Altinn Platform is possible to use outside Altinn Apps and Altinn Platform similar to how Altinn Authorization is used by external wihout deploying any digital services to the platform.\nHow this should work is not analyzed and specified yet. The issue is found here\nOther event concepts in the platform Events are used in different scenarios in the platform.\nInstance Events - Events that happen on a given instance. It could be created, saved, ++ This is stored to cosmos DB. The number of details in these events is higher than we would put on an event feed. See Instance Events in Storage Application logic events - These are events where app developers could implement logic to get a specific behavior.

	"content": "\n\u0026ldquo;Altinn Repositories\u0026rdquo; er en frittstående Git versjonskontroll og Application Lifecycle Management-løsning, som både Designer, kodeeditorer og andre eksterne verktøy vil benytte som back-end og felles sted for å lagre og versjonere tjenestene som utvikles.\nRepositories har et GitHub-lignende brukergrensesnitt og både Git og REST-baserte tekniske grensesnitt.\nDet vil være en omfattende jobb å forsøke å utvikle en Git + ALM løsning på egen hånd, ref. all funksjonaliteten som behøves.\nHeldigvis finnes det flere open source \u0026ldquo;GitHub-kloner\u0026rdquo; som vi kan benytte, og blant dem virker Gitea å være mest lovende (uttales som /ɡɪ’ti:/ - \u0026ldquo;gitty\u0026rdquo;). Bilder fra Gitea benyttes som eksempler videre i denne dokumentasjonen.\nFunksjonalitet i \u0026ldquo;Repositories\u0026rdquo; Repositories inneholder et repository med versjonerte filer for hver 3.0-tjeneste. Eksempel på typer filer som en \u0026ldquo;3.0-tjeneste\u0026rdquo; vil kunne bestå av er kode, tester, web-komponenter, layouts og stiler, oversettinger, arbeidsflyt og konfigurasjon.\nRepositories vil tilby funksjonalitet rundt den enkelte 3.0-tjeneste, og eksponere funksjonaliteten via både brukergrensesnitt og et REST-API som er en klone av GitHub sitt v3 API-format. Dette er positivt da det finnes andre verktøy som også støtter dette API-formatet, og da det kan forenkle det å kunne erstatte Gitea som back-end med andre liknende Git-systemer.\n3.0 Tjeneste Repository som representerer en \u0026ldquo;3.0-tjeneste\u0026rdquo;, aka app, og inneholder alle filer som tjenesten består av.\nHver utgave av en tjeneste vil leve i sin egen mappe, slik at ett repository kan inneholde èn eller flere utgaver av den samme tjenesten.\nRepository management Håndtering av repositories er en kjerneaktivitet, da hver tjeneste som utvikles vil lagres i sitt eget repository.\nCreate/delete repository Link to repository Rename repository Fork repository Muliggjør at man kan ha et \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo;-repository med felles tjenester som flere andre kan benytte, slik som dagens \u0026ldquo;master-tjenester\u0026rdquo; bare mye kraftigere Muliggjør også at utviklere kan lage som egen kopi og teste ut nye muligheter og løsninger på sitt eget område uten å påvirke originalen List repositories Download/upload files Download repo Create files and folders Read/edit files Rename files Delete files View raw file Link to file Dokumentering Det er viktig å ha god støtte for å dokumentere tjenestene man utvikler, slik at det vil være enkelt for andre personer på teamet å bidra. Det er derfor ønskelig å ha innebygd Wiki-funksjonalitet med støtte for å editere i markdown, slik som i Altinn docs og AltinnPedia.\nWiki Add/edit/delete pages Markdown editing Link to specific wiki page Support for other external wikis Emojis Markdown editing Preview Fullscreen Side-by-side Versjonering Hver eneste fil som en 3.0-tjeneste består av skal ha full versjonshistorikk, uavhengig av om man jobber mot filene via Designer eller eksternt og distribuert/lokalt i en kodeeditor på egen maskin. Repositories sitt versjonskontrollsystem, som er basert på Git, er laget nettopp med tanke på dette.\nVersion history of all files, artifacts, code and configuration Link to each change with a unique id Link to each changed file Link to who did the change Highlight the last change done in the repository Time of change Comments/messages Diff between versions Release management En svært viktig egenskap når man utvikler programvare (noe som 3.0-tjenester er) er å kunne tagge ulike versjoner, og kunne gå tilbake og teste eller patche en tidligere versjon hvis man ønsker det. Det er også viktig å kunne se alt som har endret seg mellom versjonene.\nSiden Git benyttes for versjonering, så vil en release/tag som opprettes peke på en eksakt versjon av hver eneste fil som en 3.0-tjeneste består av, og man kan enkelt se hva som er endret.\nCreate tags for the 3.0 app Link to tags Create/delete releases Link to releases Marking of pre-releases Time of release creation User that triggered the release Download zipped files of release Browse content of a given tag/release QA En QA-prosess for godkjenning av endringer basert på branching og pull requests, vil for større teams kunne være mulig. Dette er i tråd med hvordan programvare utvikles, inkludert selve Altinn.\nBacklog management Som for all annen programvareutvikling, så vil hver 3.0-tjeneste typisk ha en egen backlog med bugs, forbedringer, fremtidige features, etc. som tjenesteutviklerne vil jobbe mot. Dette er en sentral del av Application Lifecycle Management.\nCreate/close issues pr. 3.0 app Time of creation Who Filter issues by open/closed Add labels Filter issues by label Assign to milestone Filter issues by milestone Assign to user Filter issues by assignee Markdown editing Discussions Add files to issue Notifications when issues change Issues search List issues Org management Organisasjoner er tjenesteeiere, men i 3.0 er det ikke noe i veien for at brukere også kan utvikle tjenester. I en organisasjon så kan man gi tilganger til brukere, og man kan opprette teams med tilgang til en eller flere 3.0-tjenester.\nDet å håndtere organisasjonen, som alt annet, skal være 100% selvbetjent.\nCreate/delete organisations Name/shortname URL Logo List organisations Link to organisation Create repository for organisation ref. repository management Add/remove teams in organisation List teams in organisation Add/remove users in organisation List all users in organisation Add/remove users in teams List users in teams Brukerstyring Brukerne i denne sammenheng er tjenesteutvklerne. Det å håndtere organisasjonen skal være helt selvbetjent.\nAdd/remove users Name Avatar Add/remove users to/from teams \u0026ldquo;Starring\u0026rdquo; of favorite repositories List of user repositories (including forks) Activity log for user Workspace for user (dette er veldig viktig, betyr at tjenesteutviklere kan \u0026ldquo;leke seg\u0026rdquo; på sitt eget område) I første omgang (MVP) vil tjenesteeier (org-admin) legge til alle sine brukere i gruppen \u0026ldquo;owner\u0026rdquo; slik at de får tilgang til å opprette repositories (tjenester). Gruppen \u0026ldquo;owner\u0026rdquo; gir vide fullmakter på organisasjonsnivå (dvs tjenesteeiernivå), så på sikt vil det implementeres mer granulert tilgangsstyring.\nSøke Søk er viktig for å finne frem, og skal være bygd inn i løsningen.\nRepositories Issues Edits Users Organisations Tilgangsstyring Det skal være mulig å styre tilgang til repositories, les/skriv/admin, teams, brukere, samt opprette private repos.\nAccess to 3.0 apps (read/write) Access to orgs Users access Private/public app-repos Administrator AM/AD-integration API access Trigge hendelser I dagens hverdag, med bruk av Slack og andre systemer ifbm. utvikling, så er det viktig at \u0026ldquo;Repositories\u0026rdquo; kan trigge hendelser i andre systemer, f.eks. poste til en Slack-kanal når en endring skjer i en 3.0-tjeneste.\nTrigger events at org-level Trigger events at 3.0 app-level Logge inn Tjenesteutviklere og andre interessenter skal kunne logge inn og få tilgang til organisasjoner og 3.0-tjenester.\nLogin page CAPTCHA?

The values.yaml-file contains different values. These values are accessable in the templates. So different environment variables can be defined in the values. Values can also be overwritten when running a upgrade or install of the chart.\nThe files in the templates-folder becomes populated with the values, and sent to the kubernetes clusters as the name of the files. So deployment.yaml should create a deployment in kubernetes. The same fore service.yaml and ingress.yaml.\n_helpers.tpl can be used to define functions to get release names, concatinated with other info. NOTES.txt is the info printed in the cli after an install or upgrade of an release, usually used to give usefull commands the user can run to access the pods.\nHelm usage in Altinn Studio We use helm to deploy our builds to the kubernetes cluster, both in development-, production- and SBL-cluster. Azure Dev Ops pipelines have support for helm, so this makes deploying to development trigger everytime we merge some code into master.\nLinks https://helm.sh https://github.com/helm/helm "

Terraform allows to write declarative configuration files defining the infrastructure we use in the different solutions.\nTerraform follow the principle of \u0026ldquo;desired state\u0026rdquo;. Configuration files describe to Terraform the components needed to run the different solutions in Altinn 3.\nTerraform generates an execution plan describing what it will do to reach the desired state, and then executes it to build the described infrastructure.\nAs the configuration changes, Terraform is able to determine what changed and create incremental execution plans which can be applied.\nThis is crucial for the Altinn DevOps team to being able handle an infrastrucre at this scale.\nWe use the Terraform Azure Provider that allows lifecycle management of Microsoft Azure using the Azure Resource Manager APIs. This is a provider maintained by the Azure team at Microsoft and the Terraform team at HashiCorp.\nThe resource ARM Apis are used to verify state of infrastucture and perform changes.\nWe use Azure Devops Repos to store our Terraform scripts for the different solutions.

This object contains metadta about the specific instance. If you want to learn more about the instance and the affiliated API you can read the technical documentation about this under \u0026ldquo;API\u0026rdquo;.\nSubstatus As an app-owner you can set a substatus for the instance, this is to allow the end user further information about which condition the instance is currently in. Substatus is displayed both in the Altinn message box and in the receipt page.\nThe substatus is an object which can be set in the instance object. How this is done is described under API. Substatus is a simple object which contains label and description. These fields can either contain clean text, or a text key that refers to the application texts. It is worth noting that we do not support variables in text for these texts. In the message box, label is limited to 25 symbols and if it contains more than 25 symbols, only the first 22 symbols will be used and \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; will be added to the end.\nExample of a status object:\n{ \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;some.label\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Description in clear text\u0026#34; } Below you see an example of how substatus looks like in the message box and in the receipt where the substatus is set up in the following way:\n{ \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Accepted\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Your application has been accepted by the king.\u0026#34; } Automatic deletion of drafts As an application owner you can imagine some cases where deleting a user\u0026rsquo;s draft after a certain time is necessary. To achieve this three steps are required:\nThe application needs to be configured to allow the service owner to delete instances Identify which instances that haven\u0026rsquo;t been completed via requesting storage Delete the instance via an exposed endpoint within the application Step 1: Configuring the application Service owners are not allowed to delete instances by default. To get the required permissions a rule must be added into policy.xml, placed in App/config/authorization. The rule can be copied from our rule library.\nStep 2: Identify which instances are incomplete by sending a request to storage Storage exposes a set of query parameters which can be used to retrieve a set of instances. The example below retrieves all non-submitted instances of a given application that was instantiated on the 30. of september 2020.\nYou can try query parameters for your service here.\nHTTP GET https://platform.altinn.no/storage/api/v1/instances?appId={org}/{app}\u0026amp;created=lte:2020-09-30\u0026amp;process.currentTask=Task_1\nStep 3: Delete instance via endpoint exposed in the application After identifying the instances that are to be deleted, you can send a call to the application to delete these with the instance id (instanceOwner.partyId/instanceGuid).\nHTTP DELETE https://ttd.apps.altinn.no/ttd/apps-test/instances/{instanceOwner.partyId}/{instanceGuid}\n"

Validation rules for instantiation can include validating a time to specific user instructions and complex tests that require external API calls.\nExample 1 - Instantiation only allowed before 3 pm on any given day public async Task\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult\u0026gt; RunInstantiationValidation(Instance instance) { DateTime now = DateTime.Now; if (now.Hour \u0026lt; 15) { return new InstantiationValidationResult() { Valid = false, Message = \u0026#34;ERROR: Instantiation not possible before 3PM.\u0026#34; }; } return null; } Example 2 - Instantiation only allowed for application owner The application this example is based on is available here. (requires login in altinn.studio)\nTo limit instantiation to a given entity, in this case the application owner, two files must be changed: App.cs and InstantiationHandler.cs.\nIn App.cs the http-context is made available and user data (claims principals) is retrieved from the context by calling _httpContext.User.\nTo validate the instantiation, you can check one of two claims in the context. Either the organization\u0026rsquo;s three-letter abbreviation or the organization number. The validation is run in InstantiationHandler.cs and the example below uses the organization abbreviation.\nTo validate based on organization number you can follow the example below, and replace AltinnCoreClaimTypes.Org with AltinnCoreClaimTypes.OrgNumber. You can see the changes required in the file below.\npublic async Task\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult\u0026gt; RunInstantiationValidation(Instance instance, ClaimsPrincipal user) { var result = new InstantiationValidationResult(); string org = string.Empty; if (user.HasClaim(c =\u0026gt; c.Type == AltinnCoreClaimTypes.Org)) { Claim orgClaim = user.FindFirst(c =\u0026gt; c.Type == AltinnCoreClaimTypes.Org); if (orgClaim != null) { org = orgClaim.Value; } } if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(org) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; org.Equals(\u0026#34;ttd\u0026#34;)) { result.Valid = true; } else { result.Valid = false; result.Message = \u0026#34;Only ttd is allowed to instantiate this application.\u0026#34;; } return await Task.FromResult(result); } Example 3 - Instantiation only allowed between certain dates To limit instantiation to a certain time frame, in this example January 2021, one file requires changes:InstantiationHandler.cs.\nThe method RunInstantiationValidation will run whenever someone tries to instantiate the application, so logic is placed here to verify that the time is within the allowed frame.\npublic async Task\u0026lt;InstantiationValidationResult\u0026gt; RunInstantiationValidation(Instance instance) { InstantiationValidationResult result = null; DateTime now = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime(DateTime.UtcNow, TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(\u0026#34;Central European Standard Time\u0026#34;)); if (now \u0026lt; new DateTime(2021, 01, 01)) { result = new InstantiationValidationResult { Valid = false, Message = \u0026#34;Application cannot be instantiated before 1.1.2021\u0026#34; }; } else if (now \u0026gt; new DateTime(2021, 01, 31)) { result = new InstantiationValidationResult { Valid = false, Message = \u0026#34;Application cannot be instantiated after 25.1.2021\u0026#34; }; } return await Task.FromResult(result); } Logic connected to date handling has been added to ensure the Norwegian time zone is being used in the validation.\nDateTime now = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime(DateTime.UtcNow, TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById(\u0026#34;Central European Standard Time\u0026#34;)); Furthermore, a simple test is run to see if the current time is within the given time frame\n(now \u0026lt; new DateTime(2021, 01, 01) If the requirements are not met, the return object is populated with an InstantiationValidationResult object that contains two fields: Valid: a boolean that says if the instantiation is valid or not. Message: a string that can contain an error message if it is not valid.\nresult = new InstantiationValidationResult { Valid = false, Message = \u0026#34;Application cannot be instantiated before 1.1.2021\u0026#34; }; In addition you have the opportunity to use property ValidParties: a list of the parties that are allowed to instantiate the application.\nThe result of a failed validation is shown below:\n"

In addition application developers can add their custom APIS.\nThe different platform components exposes API to applications and external parties.\nAll this is possible because the backend framework let developers create and expose APIS. This also include app developers that create applications in Altinn Studio.\nIn the same way the different applications and components consumes APIS from other sources both inside the Altinn 3 platform solutions and external sources.\nThe APIS exposed as standard from Apps and platform is described here\nPublish \u0026amp; Subscribe A important change for Altinn moving to the new platform is we change to an event driven architecture.\nAs part of the Altinn 3 platform it is created a Events component that apps and other can publish their events and other can subscribe to.\nThis is in detailed explained under Events capabilities\nTransport \u0026amp; Delivery The different solutions of the platform support transport \u0026amp; delivery of the data.\nBy default the clients are the active parts for transporting data.

	"content": "Bruk av Redux Store i Containere og Components. Kort oppsummert (TL;DR) Send \u0026ldquo;ID\u0026rdquo; eller andre identifikatorer via Props til komponenten og la komponenten hente data fra Redux Store.\nUtfordring (Why?) Hvis en del av Redux Store sendes som Props så vil komponenten re-rendres ved endringer av denne Prop/Store. Det er ønskelig at komponenter ikke rendrer unødvendig.\nRe-rendring trigges av… Endring av Props. Endring av State som endrer Props. Kilder Redux best practices Common pitfalls Filtrering av Redux Store i mapStateToProps() ved help av Selector Kort oppsummert (TL;DR) Bruk Memoized Selector for å filtrere Redux Store til Props når Redux Store er stor.\nUtfordring (Why?) Hver gang (en del av) Redux Store endrer seg vil funksjoner som filtrerer ut deler av Redux Store kjøres. Hvis Redux Store (state tree) er stor (mange endringer) eller funksjonen er krevende kan det føre til ytelsesproblemer.\nLøsningen En Selector funksjon, med bruk av \u0026ldquo;reduxjs/reselect\u0026rdquo; vil kun kjøres når en definert del av Redux Store endres (eks \u0026ldquo;state.del.underdel\u0026rdquo;).\nKilder Reselect Comparing shouldComponentUpdate() and Reselect Eksempel Selector Dette er en enkel Selector uten mye logikk og filtrering. Jo større logikk i \u0026ldquo;filtreringen\u0026rdquo; jo mer \u0026ldquo;sparer\u0026rdquo; man i ytelse.\nimport { createSelector } from \u0026#39;reselect\u0026#39;; /** * Reselect version */ const formDataSelector = (state: any, providedProps: any) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;formdata selector\u0026#39;, providedProps.id); return state.formFiller.formData; }; const dataModelBindingSelector = (state: any, providedProps: any) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;datamodelBindingSelector\u0026#39;); return state.formDesigner.layout.components[providedProps.id].dataModelBinding; }; const getFormData = () =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;getFormData() is trigggered, selector is created\u0026#39;); return createSelector( [formDataSelector, dataModelBindingSelector], (formData: any, dataModelBinding: any) =\u0026gt; { console.log(\u0026#39;ouput selector running\u0026#39;, formData); if (!formData) return \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; if (!formData[dataModelBinding]) return \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; return formData[dataModelBinding]; }, ); }; export const makeGetFormDataSelector = getFormData; // Alternativt en enda enklere variant, som er implementert p.t. import { createSelector } from \u0026#39;reselect\u0026#39;; const formDataSelector = (state: any, providedProps: any) =\u0026gt; { return state.formFiller.formData[state.formDesigner.layout.components[providedProps.id].dataModelBinding]; }; const getFormData = () =\u0026gt; { return createSelector( [formDataSelector], (formData: any) =\u0026gt; { if (!formData) return \u0026#39;\u0026#39;; return formData; }, ); }; export const makeGetFormDataSelector = getFormData; Implementasjon i mapStateToProps const makeMapStateToProps = () =\u0026gt; { const GetFormDataSelector = makeGetFormDataSelector(); const mapStateToProps = (state: IAppState, props: IProvidedProps): IFormElementProps =\u0026gt; ({ id: props.id, formData: GetFormDataSelector(state, props), }); return mapStateToProps; }; export const FormComponentWrapper = connect(makeMapStateToProps)(FormComponent); makeMapStateToProps implementeres slik at Selectoren kan gjenbrukes på tvers av flere komponenter.\nHigher-Order Components Higher-Order component er en funksjon som tar imot en component og returnerer et nytt komponent med ekstra funksjoner, eller ekstra data. Et eksempel på dette er connect-funksjonen fra \u0026ldquo;redux\u0026rdquo;, som tar imot en funksjon som velger redux-state data, og en komponent som disse dataene skal sendes til.\nHvorfor? Ved å wrappe induviduelle komponenter i en higher-order component, vil vi få enklere kode mtp. at en funksjon håndterer endringer i skjemaet på kun en komponent, i motsetning til å ha en funksjon som håndterer alle endringer i skjemaet. Dette vil også gi tredjeparts-utviklere en enklere måte å skrive egne funksjoner for håndtering av endringer i deres komponenter.\nEksempel på bruk i Altinn Studio Når bruker lager en tjeneste med 3. parts komponenter vil vi wrappe disse komponentene i en Higher Order Component som gir den en callback funksjon som tar imot data som komponenten har, og kjøre en redux-action som oppdaterer data i redux-state. Uten at utvikleren av 3. parts komponenten må sette seg inn i hvilke actions som skal kjøres. Dette gir også bedre mulighet for å gjennbruke 3. parts komponenter.\nEksempel på Higher Order Component const FormComponentWrapper = (WrappedComponent, ...) =\u0026gt; { // Feel free to do anything that will enhance the components properties // Return a react component return class extends React.Component { // Add functions for handling changing of data handleDataChange = (dataModelBinding, data) =\u0026gt; { // fire off an action for adding the changed data to redux state } render() { return( \u0026lt;WrappedComponent onFormDataChange={this.handleDataChange} {...props}/\u0026gt; ); } } } Kilder Higher-Order component Normalized Redux Store Kort oppsummert (TL;DR) Hver datatype får sin egen \u0026ldquo;tabell\u0026rdquo; i State. Hver \u0026ldquo;tabell\u0026rdquo; skal lagre individuelle \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; som objekter, med IDer som nøkler og \u0026ldquo;dataen\u0026rdquo; som verdi.

First we must generate a new JSON Web Key. In this example we use mkjwk.org. Fill in values like the example below and Generate.\nThen you will get keys like this.\nThis public key we will add to our client in Samarbeidsportalen. Press Egne public nøkler\nThe key must be stored in an array so add [].\nCopy the public key from the JSON Web key (marked 1 in the picture) and paste this into the array. Press Legg til.\nNow the client in maskinporten is complete.\nThe last part will be to use the public and private keypair in the Altinn CLI application. Copy this (marked 2 in the picture) and Base64 encode it. Base64encode.org can be used for encoding. Then use this value as EncodedJwk in appsettings.json.\n"

It is set up through a data model for the message, and a layout describing what the message should look like in the GUI. Because of this, message is not its own task type. This enables greater flexibility for Messages in Altinn 3 and allows them to be used as either the only task in a process, or as a part of a larger process.\nWe have made some tools to simplify the process of getting started with setting up a message in an app.\nData model We have made a standard data model for messages, to make getting started easier. This data model can be found here. It can be used as is, as a starting point, or exchanged for your own data model.\nLayout The layout can be defined by yourself in the same way as a form. We have also created a message widget, to make it easier to get started. This widget contains all the necessary components to recreate the example below. It also contains texts which are added to the resource files automatically, and contains variables with references to Title and Body in a standard data model. If you should wish for different texts, or to use a different data model, just edit either the components or the texts according to your wishes after they have been added to the page.\nNote that if one wishes to use the _attachment list_, which is a standard message widget, one must manually add the _data types_ of the attachments to the layout file. A placeholder has been added to this component when it is added to the widget. Functionality to set it in Altinn Studio will be added at a later date. Accessible data types are located in the `applicationMetadata.json` file in the app. If the data types are missing in `applicationMetadata.json` generation of PDFs will not work.\r"

	"description": "Altinn 3 is open source with an open backlog, open documentation and open dialogue and discussions.",
	"content": "There are many who have noticed that Altinn has chosen a new and very open direction in recent years.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve received questions about why, and thought it would be interesting that we share our thoughts on open source, as as central national common component in Norway.\nSharing and reuse There are many good reasons to share your code as open source.\nNAV, one of the trailblazers of open source in Norway, is also repeating several of the same arguments (Norwegian Only), and especially the importance of transparency and trust related to solutions financed by the public.\nWe applaud, when NAV writes this:\nSolutions funded by the public should be publicly available.\nThe motivation is then not mainly reuse, although it is obviously a nice side effect.\nThe motivation is primarily openness and transparency in the digital solutions.\nBut to be clear, reuse is something we in Altinn consider a central motivation. And we\u0026rsquo;re not alone thinking like this:\nthe UK government action plan Open Source, Open Standards and Re­Use (PDF) describes reuse as both a policy and a principle. EU has has had a clear open source strategy (PDF) for a long time. We facilitate reuse and sharing at all levels of the Altinn architecture, from our principles to the entire platform and infrastructure, down to design and UI-widgets, code and configuration.\nThis is also one of several reasons why Altinn is now a Digital Public Good (DPG), where the goal is to be able to reuse everything we develop not only at national level, but also globally to accelerate the attainment of the sustainable development goals.\nWe also encourage the developers building apps using Altinn Studio to also share their apps. In fact, you have to do an active decision not to share, since sharing and reuse is central to the concept of Altinn 3.\nCooperation The best way to get a good collaboration across organizations and projects is openness and transparency, that everyone can contribute, provide input, be heard, follow what\u0026rsquo;s happening.\nThis has been a central point in the open source \u0026ldquo;revolution\u0026rdquo;, that has become the new norm for large parts of software development in the world. There are now 40 million developers and over 28 million open repositories on GitHub.\nSince all the tools and dependencies we use are open source on Github, we in Altinn can also follow what\u0026rsquo;s happening, and collaborate and contribute back to the software we\u0026rsquo;re using.\nExamples of such open source software is .NET, Kubernetes, React, Linkerd and Gitea. And our issue #5992 is a good example on how we can track and easily link to issues across software.\nAnd since Altinn is open source at Github, it is as easy for everyone else to do the same thing to us. Both creating new issues, contribute in discussions or contribute code, something the label external-contribution-❤️ illustrates well.\nVendor bindings Altinn as a national common component has previously experienced major challenges by building on closed proprietary software. Software from Adobe in Altinn 1 and from Microsoft in Altinn 2.\nEnd-of-life for proprietary software is actually the main reason for why we had to create Altinn 3.\nWhen building a solution on top of proprietary software, then you\u0026rsquo;ve lost control over your own future, for example if the vendor chooses to phase out the product.\nIf your solution is built on top of open source products then you, or anybode else, can make a fork in such a situation.\nAltinn 3 is therefore based on software and libraries which is open source.\nWe think this naturally is also very important for those who consider whether to adopt Altinn or not.\nWhich bindings do we introduce to Altinn as a technical solution and to Digdir as a \u0026ldquo;supplier\u0026rdquo;? Even though Altinn is a cooperation, this will be an important question.\nAltinn 3 is therefore completely open source with a permissive license, and everything runs as regular containers.\nThe best tools To develop good software, it is important to have access to good tools.\nOne thing that many may not think about is that when you share what you develop as open source, many of the very best tools out there are available - for free.\n\u0026ldquo;Share, and thou will be shared with\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHere are some of the wonderful SaaS-tools that we use:\nGitHub - Handling of source code, backlogs, boards, automation, CI/CD, etc. ZenHub - Epics, estimates, agile reports. Cypress - Dashboards and automated UI-testing. SonarCloud - Static analysis of source code. LGTM - Security analysis of source code. And this is just a small selection\u0026hellip;\nAlso, all tools and framework that we build Altinn 3 on top of, is open software that is also very popular.\nThe best people It is a common theme that people like to work with new technology and the best tools. The best developers also prefer to work with open source, feeling that one contributes to something bigger, that one leaves a mark on the world.\nIn the time that has passed since we launched Altinn 3 (Norwegian only) in the summer of 2020, we\u0026rsquo;ve hired some very skilled people, and a repeating pattern in interviews and discussions is that the best candidates are clearly expressing that they think open source is important, and that this is something they want to participate in.\nWe want to build a big community, where everyone can contribute, and then it is important that we have skilled and happy developers who can help make that happen.\n"

	"content": "Innledning Figuren under viser de viktigste komponentene i løsningen. OED er realisert som en serie Tjenester 3.0 app\u0026rsquo;er med en overordnet app med skreddersydd GUI og øvrige Tjenester 3.0 apper for spesifikke formål.\nApp\u0026rsquo;ene kan ikke instansieres fra tjenestekatalogen. Hovedapp\u0026rsquo;en instansieres utelukkende fra Domstol grensesnittet, og «Altinn avgiver» (process instance owner) er avdøde. Arvinger og evt andre som skal benytte løsningen får tilgang til instansen via tildelte roller i Altinn autorisasjon. Brukeren (arvingen) finner app\u0026rsquo;en fra en melding «Altinn correspondence» i meldingsboksen i Altinn. Meldingen inneholder en direktelenke til riktig instans i Tjenester 3.0. Se for øvrig 3 Grensesnitt mot Domstolene.\nLøsningens hovedapp har følgende adresse i Altinn Studio: designer og kode.\nOppdeling i Tjenester 3.0 apper Hovedapp\u0026rsquo;en har et skreddersydd brukergrensesnitt fordi Tjenester 3.0 p.t. ikke støtter å lage vilkårlige applikasjoner. Løsningen er derfor splittet opp i flere app\u0026rsquo;er slik at mest mulig realiseres som standard tjeneste 3.0 apper. I første omgang gjelder dette skjemautfylling. På sikt kan det også være aktuelt å flytte «innsynsfunksjonalitet» ut i Tjenester 3.0 app\u0026rsquo;er, men p.t. er støtten for GUI design i Tjenester 3.0 såvidt begrenset at det er vanskelig å implementere ønsket brukeropplevelse.\nSkjema app\u0026rsquo;ene blir instansiert og preutfylt fra hovedapp\u0026rsquo;en når brukeren tar initiativ til å starte skjemautfylling. Skjemaet blir instansiert med avdøde som «Altinn avgiver» (process instance owner), og fødselsnummer til den arvingen som startet skjemautfylling blir lagt som en nøkkel på instansdataene med Tjenester 3.0 mekanismen «data value» med nøkkel «ssn».\nDet er lagt opp til at alle arvingene aksesserer de samme skjemainstansene bortsett fra skjemaet «oed-signature». I sistnevnte skjema blir det en unik instans per arving.\nAll innsending av data fra arvingene gjøres via skjema app\u0026rsquo;er. Signering ved innsending benytter derfor standard Tjenester 3.0 funksjonalitet. Hvis gjeldene funksjonalitet for signering ikke tilfredsstiller formelle krav til løsningen (f.eks. om man ønsker nivå 4 signering), må dette være utvidelser/forbedringer i Tjenester 3.0 plattformen \u0026ndash; ikke spesifikt i OED løsningen.\nFølgende app\u0026rsquo;er finnes p.t.:\noed (hoved app) oed-register-agri-property oed-register-heirs oed-register-marriage-pact oed-register-testament oed-signature Mer dokumentasjon knyttet mot applikasjoner vedrørende Tjenester 3.0 finnes her:\nOED: https://github.com/Altinn/oed/issues/442\nT3.0: https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio/issues/6880\nGrensesnitt mot Domstolene Grensesnittet for å motta data fra Domstolene er definert av Domstolene og ligger på GitHub - Altinn/oed-da. Dette er et hendelsesbasert grensesnitt med samme oppbygning som eksiterende Altinn grensesnitt mot Folkeregisteret. P.t. er det bare spesifisert overføringer av nye avdøde og arvinger, men det er forventet at grensesnittet kan utvides til endringer på avdøde og arvinger samt testamentinformasjon.\nProsjektet har besluttet å implementere grensesnittet som en Altinn II batch. Bakgrunnen for at grensesnittet ikke ble implementert i Tjenester 3.0 er:\nTjenester 3.0 støttet ikke batch jobber da beslutningen ble tat Tjenester 3.0 har ikke et regime for driftsoppfølging av batcher Tjenester 3.0 tilbyr ikke databaser for app\u0026rsquo;er utover lagring av skjemadata og instansdata. Domstol grensesnittet krever at man lagrer en tilstand mellom hver kjøring. Altinn II har ikke eksponert eksterne tjenester for å laste inn roller/rettigheter. Altinn II batch jobber kan benytte interne tjenester. Batchen kjøres automatisk ved regelmessige intervaller og gjør følgende:\nHenter nye arvinger fra Domstolene Tildeler roller mellom arving og avdøde i Altinn Autorisasjon Gjør oppslag mot KRR (Altinn kopi) angående reservasjon mot elektronisk behandling. Det er p.t. ikke avgjort om Altinn skal ha ansvar for dette og hva som eventuelt skal være konsekvensen hvis det foreligger en reservasjon. Hente utfyllende informasjon om arving og avdøde fra Folkeregisteret (Altinn kopi). Sjekke om det finnes en instans av boet. Opprette instans hvis den ikke finnes Legge arving inn blant instansdata Sende melding til arving (Altinn II Correspondence). Meldingen blir liggende i Altinn meldingsboks dyplenke inn til avdødes instans Sende varsling til arving på epost/SMS basert på informasjon fra KRR. (Gjøres som en integrert del av forrige punkt.) Batchen ligger i Altinn II repo for batcher og heter Altinn.SBL.Batch.DA.\nGrensesnitt data fra eksterne aktører Autorisasjon Nedenfor beskrives hva som ligger til grunn for autorisasjonen.\nImplisitt fullmakt fra DA (1-2)\nAltinn mottar en implisitt fullmakt fra DA (dvs at en person er en arving) ved hjelp av DA grensesnittet (1). Fullmakten lagres i Altinn (2). Fullmakten lagres logisk to steder:\nI boets instans i OED appen\nDet lagres hvem som er avdød og hvilke arvinger som har fullmakt. Se for øvrig åpne punkter nederst i dokumentet.\nSom autorisasjonsregler i Altinn sin standard autorisasjonsløsning\nDet lages en eller flere autorisasjonsregler per arving.\nAksess til eksterne ressurser fra OED basert på fullmakt (3-7)\nBasert på fullmakt fra DA kan OED hente data fra eksterne kilder på vegne av arvinger med fullmakt. OED gjør system-til-system oppslag mot eksterne kilder. Oppslagene autoriseres ved hjelp av egnet autorisasjonsinfrastruktur \u0026ndash; primært Maskinporten (3-4). Maskinporten returnerer et token (4) som sendes med til eksternt system (5). Tokenet er bevis overfor eksterne parter at forespørselen kommer fra OED. Oppslagene har nesten alltid avdødes fødselsnummer som forespørselsnøkkel (5). Eksterne systemer må stole på at OED kun gjøre forespørsel når det foreligger en fullmakt samt at OED ikke viser dataene til arvinger uten fullmakt. Avdødes fødselsnummer er nøkkel til fullmakten i OED (2).\nBeskrivelsen i dette dokumentet gjelder uavhengig av om man teknisk gjør oppslag mot eksterne kilder basert på en arvings aktivitet i portalen eller om det gjøres asynkront \u0026ndash; uavhengig av brukerinteraksjon. I figuren over er det antydet at dataene lagres i OED (7), men hvis man velger å ikke lagre dataene, påvirker ikke dette den øvrige beskrivelsen.\nVise data fra eksterne aktører til arvinger (8-12)\nDet defineres i OED hvilket krav man har til autentisering (8) av arvingene. Det er naturlig at man definerer et nivå som ID-Porten eller høyere. Alle innlogginger logges i Altinn (samt i ID-Porten eller annen ekstern infrastruktur for autentisering) (8-10). OED vet derfor alltid hvem brukeren er. OED definerer også autorisasjonsregler som gjør at det ikke er mulig for noen andre enn de som har fått autorisasjonsregler fra fullmakten å aksessere et gitt dødsbo (11). Når brukeren får tilgang til eksterne data, er disse hentet ut basert på fullmakten som foreligger fra DA, og de vises til brukeren (12) basert på autorisasjonsreglene fra fullmakten.\nRevisjonsspor\nAt de ikke blir utlevert opplysninger fra ekstern kilde uten fullmakt kan dokumenteres ved følgende revisjonsspor:\nFullmakten ligger lagret i Altinn (2). Fullmakten inkluderes saks-id fra DA. Fullmakten peker tilbake til kilden hos DA (1).\nAltinn gjør oppslag mot eksterne kilder ved hjelp av autorisasjonsinfrastruktur (primært Maskinporten) som beviser at oppslaget ble gjort fra OED (3-4). Oppslaget blir gjort med avdødes fødselsnummer som nøkkel (5-6), og samme fødselsnummer er nøkkel til fullmakten (2).\nArvingene må autentisere seg før aksess til OED (8). Alle autentiseringsforsøk blir logget i Altinn sin TTP (trusted third party) database (9-10).\nAll aksess til OED autoriseres. Alle autorisasjoner logges i altinn sin TTP (trusted third party) database (11). Autorisasjonsloggen inkluderer aktuell bruker, tidspunkt, hvilken ressurs som ble forsøkt aksessert (i dette tilfellet referanse til avdødes instans med tilhørende fullmakt i OED) og utfall av autorisasjonen.\nÅpne punkter\nSkal alle arvinger med tilgang til OED ha fullmakt? I motsatt fall må det gjøres intern autorisasjon i OED som differensierer hva slags informasjon som skal vises avhengig av hvilken arving som har logget inn.\nEr fullmakt implisitt dekket av eksisterende DA grensesnitt (ny arving foreligger i boet) eller trenger man en ny hendelse \u0026ndash; fullmakt \u0026ndash; i DA grensesnittet? Er for øvrig relatert til forrige punkt. Hvorvidt fullmakt blir en ny hendelse eller ikke påvirker ikke beskrivelsen over annet enn at DA grensesnittet eventuelt må oppdateres.\nLagring av innhentede data Det er gjort konfigurerbart (via felles kode \u0026ndash; se 4.3 Intern implementasjon) hvorvidt man skal lagre data fra aktørene blant instansdataene etter at de er framvist for arvingen. P.t. prøver man først å hente friske data når arvingen åpner app\u0026rsquo;en. Dataene lagres samtidig. Hvis man ikke får tak i data og det ligger data på instansen fra før, vises disse.\nIntern implementasjon De fleste grensesnittene har Swagger spesifikasjoner. Der dette ikke finnes lager vi Swagger manuelt. Det benyttes standard mekanismer i Visual Studio for å importere Swagger definisjonene og generere klientkode \u0026ndash; «Connected Services».\nMotparten til den genererte koden ligger i klasser i katalogen ExternalApi. I disse klassene kalles Api, og og det blir gjort en mapping til intern domenemodell.\nHver grensesnitt er tilgjengelig fra GUI via ExternalAPIController. Kontrolleren har felles kode for alle grensesnittene for å:\nKalle grensesnitt Hente instans Lagre respons i instans Benytte lagret respons hvis gjeldende oppslag ikke returnerer data Gjøre evt mapping av fødselsnummer \u0026ndash; se 4.3 Testdata Returnere data til GUI De genererte klientene konfigureres i startup.cs. Her hentes vertsnavn fra miljøspesifikke konfigurasjonsfiler.\nListe over grensesnitt P.t. benyttes følgende grensesnitt\nAktør Eks*) Swagger Skatt Skatt avregning Skatt Skatt 2020 Skatt Skatt tilgjengelige data Kartverket x API docs SVV x Kjøretøy søk Norsk Pensjon x API docs Bank KAR x DSOP KFR API Bank konto x DSOP Konto API Geo Norge x Kommune API Geo Norge x Adresse API Landbruk API docs Ektepakt x n/a SOAP grensesnitt *) Betyr at swagger kommer fra aktør og ikke er konstruert av OED\nTestdata Det mest optimale hadde vært om man kunne definere felles testdata på tvers av alle aktører i OED. Dette er imidlertid ikke realistisk på kort sikt. Det er definert en modul for mappe avdødes fødselsnummer, som benyttes som nøkkel i nesten alle eksterne grensesnitt, til et passende fødselsnummer hos aktuell aktør.\nMappingen utføres bare når man kjører løsningen i et testmiljø. Mappingen ligger som kode i metoden MapSsn i ExternalAPIController.\nKode for å autorisere mot Maskinporten og eventuell utveksling av token fra Maskinporten til Altinn JWT ligger i Util/MaskinportenUtil.\nGrensesnitt for å hente ut data Eksterne aktører \u0026ndash; i første omgang primært Domstolene \u0026ndash; kan hente ut data via standardiserte Api fra Tjenester 3.0. Dette er beskrevet i Storage API \u0026ndash; Altinn.\nDet anbefales å benytte en hendelsesbasert innfallsvinkel til å hente ut data. Dette er beskrevet i Integration \u0026amp; Data Transport Capabilties \u0026ndash;Altinn.\nDet finnes tilgjengelige data fra hver app. Det antas at Domstolene i første omgang vil hente data fra skjema app\u0026rsquo;ene. Avdøde vil være «instance owner». Fødselsnummeret til den arvingen som fylte ut skjemaet, vil ligge som «data value» med nøkkel «ssn».\nCustom GUI for hoved app Tjenester 3.0 tilbyr p.t. ingen støtte for skreddersydde brukergrensesnitt, som man trenger i hovedapp. Det er derfor tatt utgangspunkt i en kopi av Tjenester 3.0 sin fulle klient for skjemautfylling. I denne klienten er det i noen grad fjernet komponenter som ikke er relevante for en skreddersydd klient, men det gjenstående er likevel stort og komplekst.\nKlienten - altinn-app-frontend.js - lenkes inn i fila App\\views\\Home\\Index.cshtml. I utviklingsmiljøet benyttes lokal node modul mens i prod- og testmiljøer refereres den ferdig kompilerte .js-fila fra bygg prosessen.\nOED spesifikk kode for klienten ligger hovedsakelig under mappen features/custom, der mapper og filer oppdeles logisk basert på visningstype og fagområde. Det har blitt tatt i bruk eksisterende biblioteker, basert på kopien av Tjenester 3.0 sin fulle klient og ikke lagt til nye utenom React testing library og Cypress. Disse bibliotekene blir brukt for enhetstesting, ende-til-ende testing og universell utforming tester.\nDet har blitt utviklet en del komponenter, både spesifikt tilknyttet OED design men også tilknyttet Altinn 3 Figma Designsystem ettersom Tjenester 3.0 per nå har ingen felles bibliotek som brukes av andre klienter. Det har vært mye samarbeid mellom OED og Tjenester 3.0 for å løse slik problematikk og OED har utviklet, tildelsvis med Tjenester 3.0 en rekke enkle komponenter med tilhørende design basert på Altinn 3 Designsystem. Disse ligger innunder mappen features/custom/common/inputs. Tanken har vært at disse enkle komponentene kan tas rett ut fra prosjektet og legges ut på npm for felles bruk av alle klienter. Dette har stoppet opp da det ikke har vært relevant for OED lenger å utvikle egne skjema komponenter, som nevnt innunder kapittel 2.\nRedux og React Context brukes av OED for intern state håndtering da Redux var allerede vesentlig brukt av Tjenester 3.0. I Redux ligger det mye data som kommer fra kopien av Tjenester 3.0 sin klient og Redux Store har blitt utvidet til å inneha data fra eksterne aktører, eksempelvis data fra banker, Statens Vegvesen, Norsk Pensjon og andre.\nDrift og overvåkning Før man kan gå i produksjon må det avklares hvordan løsningen kan driftes og overvåkes. Viktige momenter vil være:\nMonitorere at Tjenester 3.0 app\u0026rsquo;ene er oppe og fungerer Monitorere at batch for DA grensesnitt kjører og fungerer. Det må avklares om Altinn Forvaltning skal benyttes i denne sammenheng. Analyse av feillogger Sanering av data "

	"content": "The prefill configuration is handled by a json file where source values are linked to fields in the app data model.\nIn order to add prefill to your application this file needs to be added to the repository alongside the datamodel under the models folder, with the same name as the data model it is connected to, and a prefill extension.\nSo, if you have a data model named ServiceModel.xsd, the file should be named ServiceModel.prefill.json\nThe prefill comes with a json-schema and which gives auto complete on the source fields. In order to use this auto-complete feature you need to use an IDE or text editor that supports json-schema (such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ etc). As of now there is no auto complete on the target fields.\nThe target fields are case insensitve, so writing Skattyterinforgrp5801.Infogrp5802.OppgavegiverNavnPreutfyltdatadef25795.value is the same as skattyterinforgrp5801.infogrp5802.oppgavegiverNavnPreutfyltdatadef25795.value.\nTo get started using prefill you can copy the following template into your repository:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/prefill/prefill.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowOverwrite\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;ER\u0026#34;: { }, \u0026#34;DSF\u0026#34;: { }, \u0026#34;UserProfile\u0026#34;: { } } The easiest way to work on the configuration file is to clone your repository locally, and edit the file in your preferred editor. To do this open a terminal and run\ngit clone https://altinn.studio/repos/[ORG]/[APP].git Then you can create the prefill config file under the models folder.\nThere are three sources you can prefill from as of now\nER (enhetsregisteret) DSF (det sentrale folkeregisteret) UserProfile All availiable source fields can bee seen here.\nThe allowOverwrite field is a flag to determine if existing values in the app data model can be overwritten by prefill data.\nBelow is an example of a prefill where two fields are connected to the name from DFS and user name from the user profile, and we have allowed prefill values to overwrite values in the data model:\n{ \u0026#34;$schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://altinncdn.no/schemas/json/prefill/prefill.schema.v1.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowOverwrite\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;ER\u0026#34;: { }, \u0026#34;DSF\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Skattyterinforgrp5801.infogrp5802.OppgavegiverNavnPreutfyltdatadef25795.value\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;UserProfile\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;UserName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Skattyterinforgrp5801.infogrp5802.OppgavegiverAdressePreutfyltdatadef25796.value\u0026#34; } } See issues related to prefill on Github.\n"

	"content": "A application deployed to Altinn Apps will typical have a business process that users and systems need to follow.\nApps created in Altinn Studio uses BPMN 2.0 standard to describe the business process and the app will have functionality to support different types of tasks in the process.\nThe process is defined by the application developer in Altinn Studio. When a new app is created it a basic process is created.\nSupported Tasks Applications will support different processes with different types of task as part of the process. The current types of tasks is implemented and planned to be implemented. This list is not final.\nData This is the task where the user or system create and updates data for one more datamodelles defined for the App.\nConfirmation (backlog) This is a task where user can look at the data filled and then confirm it.\nConfirmationAndSigning (backlog) This is a task where user can look at the data filled and then confirm and sign data.\nPayment (backlog) This is a task where user is redirected to a external payment provider to pay related to the process. The payment can be related to data filled out in earliers task, or can be a fixed value connected to the app.\nSee Github issue for details.\nSigning (backlog) Signing is a task where one or more users sign the data submitted. In most uses cases this is a strictly functional operation but depending on the authentication level it can be a digital signature involved. The different types of signing relevant for this platform is.\nThere is a epic for signing on GitHub.\nRegular signing Regular signing is when one user with a specific role is required to functional sign the data before submitting it.\nParalell signing This is a task where serverel users need/can sign the data in paralell. The task is completed when the needed amount of signatures has been added\nSee Github issue for details.\nUser controlled signing User controlled signing is a task where the data inputed in earliers task in process defines which users that needs to sign.\nSee GitHub issue for details.\nDigital Signing with BankId Digital signing with BankID creates a digital signature of the data for the instance.\nSee Github issue for details.\nLookup (backlog) This is a task in a process where user/system can lookup external data with help of inputs from UI or API.\nState change The application is responsible to make sure that.\nExample process There is some freedom of the order of task in the process, but not all combinations is functional valid.\nEach type of task will have som requirement to be fullfilled to be allowed to be completed.\nThe below diagram show some example processes that a App possible will support in the future. Even it is possible to technical order the different types of task.\nProcess: Data This is the a common process. In this scenario a user will typical fill out formdata and when formfilling task is completed the data will be marked as locked and the final data can be read from the org.\nThe org will be able to read data before the formfilling task is completed, but then the end user can still update the data.\nProcess: Data - Signing This is the a common process. In this scenario a user will typical fill out formdata and when formfilling task is completed, the process is moved to a signing task where the user can verify the data and then confirm it with a signing of data.\nDepending on the required security level for the application the signing will use PKI systems to digital sign the data or just be a more functional confirmation from the user.\nThe org will be able to read data before the formfilling task is completed, but then the end user can still update the data. The data will not be allowed to be changed while the instance is in signing task.\nProcess: Data - Confirmation - Payment In this scenario a user will typical fill out formdata and when formfilling task is completed, the process is moved to a confirm task where the user can verify the data and then confirm, when the data is confirmed the process is moved to a payment task where the user needs to pay before the process is completed.\nThe payment functionality will be handled by external payment providers. The app will integrate with API\u0026rsquo;s for the payment provider. Altinn runtime will support different payment providers.\nProcess: Data - Confirmation - External validation In this scenario a user or system will typical fill out formdata and when formfilling task is completed, the process is moved to a confirm task where the user can verify the data and then confirm it.\nThe process is the moved to a external validation task where the org is doing validation. The org can chose to complete the task or send the instance back to a earlier task for correction of the data.\nProcess Interaction\r"

Den opprettes enten av eksterne som bruker plattformen, eller av andre som har identifsert et behov.\nFeature request opprettes i de forsjellige produkt eller team backloggene.\nAltinn Studio App Template Dotnet App Frontend React Altinn Platform Altinn Authorization Altinn Authentication Altinn Notifications Altinn Storage Altinn Profile Altinn PDF Altinn Events En del av disse vil ha bakgrunn fra Altinn Apps backloggen hvor man finner backlog for apper som utvikles.\nEksempler\nRemoving data from the stored receipt Behov for alternativ visning av repeterende gruppe Product epic Kilden til denne er typisk en feature request. Denne vil inneholde detaljert beskrivelse av feature samt referer til underoppgaver som f.eks\nFunksjonelle beskrivelser og tekniske analyser User Experience og Interaction design hensyn Juridiske vurderinger Sikkerhets vurderinger Kostnad/finansierings betraktninger (Oversikt over hvilke apper som har dette behovet?) Det er produkteierne som i utgangspunktet eier denne, men får hjelp av teamarkitekter, utviklere, jurister og andre som trengs for å spesifisere disse Denne featuren epic vil ligge i produktbackloggen hvor den mest naturlig hører hjemme. Det vil være naturlig at man itererer over denne mange ganger i product planing, før den er klar til product refinement.\nEksempel 1 - funksjonel signering\nAnsvarlig: Produkteiere Analyse issues Analyse issue er github issues som typisk er lenket til product epic. Dette vil være premissgiveres vurderinger til videre realisering av epicen.\nDette kan altså f.eks være\nUser Experience og Interaction design hensyn Juridiske vurderinger Sikkerhets vurderinger Kostnad/finansierings betraktninger Aktører\nAnsvarlig: Produkteiere Utførende: Diverse premissgivere Eksempel\nUX Analyse tabell Development issue Dette er detaljerte oppgaver som er knyttet til epic og kan være analyse oppgaver eller rene implementasjonsoppgave. Issue tilknyttet en produkt feature epic trenger ikke å ligge i samme backlog som epic. Disse tas inn i sprinter som del av sprint planning\nAnsvarlig: Devops team Utførende: Devops team Roadmap feature Denne beskriver overordnet hvilken funksjonalitet feature dekker og egenskapene ved funksjonaliteten. Formålet er at eksterne interessenter skal kunne lese denne uten å lese noe annet for å få en god forståelse hvilken funksjonalitet en slik feature dekker og når den kommer.\nDenne opprettes av produkteierene. Vanligvis basert på product epics, etter at den er nødvendig analysert og kan tas inn i roadmap. Roadmap features finnes i Roadmap repository. Vi ønsker å legge oss på detaljnivået til Github Roadmap for roadmap features\nAnsvarlig: Produkteier Utførene: Produkteier Prosess Følgende prosess følges med artifakten\nFullscreen\nProduct planing Dette er arbeidet som produkteierne utfører, sammen med andre ressurser, for å skape og jobbe med epics i produkt backloggen og tilhørende analyse issues. En oppsummering av et slikt element vil kunne ende opp som et road map feature.\nAnsvarlig: Produkteier Støtte: Forretningsutviklere, Arkitekter, UX, Jurister, Sikkerhet, Forretning, Leverandørstyrere, samt andre produkteiere. Product refinement Dette er en behandling med utgangspunkt i produkt epics med hensikt om å definere underliggende development issues. Altså gjøre klart for sprintplaning, eventuelt sende det tilbake til produkt planing.\nMålet med feature refinement er å detaljere issue til et nivå at team kan ta oppgavene inn i sprinter.\nViktige teknologi valg må være analysert Bør være mulig å identifisere oppgaver å dele opp i egne issues Være detaljert nok til at man kan si noe om omfang. Sprint planing DevOps teamet tar inn development issues i en (eller flere) sprinter basert på kapasitet.\n"

	"description": "Traffic to Altinn varies widely during a year and scaling the compute resources correctly is important for stability and cost.",
	"content": "The below diagram shows how the number of unique users logged in to Altinn 2 varied through 2019.\nAltinn 2 is a monolith where all digital services run on the same servers. This means that days like the tax day when there is this enormous spike in traffic will require that all servers are scaled up. It is also an on-prem solution where scaling needs to be planned weeks ahead.\nFor Altinn 3 the story is completely different. Every organization has its separate Kubernetes cluster. Each of these clusters can be scaled independently.\nCluster Autoscaler Azure Kubernetes Services does support autoscaling of nodes and pods. Read more about cluster autoscaling.\nThis is currently not been enabled.\nResource Reservations in Azure Kubernetes Services Node resources are utilized by AKS to make the node function as part of your cluster. This usage creates a discrepancy between the node\u0026rsquo;s total resources and the resources allocatable when used in AKS. This information is important to note when setting requests and limits for user deployed pods.\nFor Altinn 3 this means the following\nStandard_D2s_v3: 100 millicores reserved per node, 1900 millicores to use Standard_D4s_v3: 140 millicores reserved per node, 3860 millicores to use Standard_D8s_v3: 180 millicores reserved per node, 7820 millicores to use Read more about resource reservations\nResource limitations In Kubernetes, it is possible to set resource limitations for each pod deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. In addition, we can define the number of minimum resources required for the pod.\n. Below there is a general example where the minimum CPU is set to 100milliCPU and maximum to 250milliCPU.\nkind: Pod apiVersion: v1 metadata: name: mypod spec: containers: - name: mypod image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine resources: requests: cpu: 100m memory: 128Mi limits: cpu: 250m memory: 256Mi Read about best practice for managing resources in Azure Kubernetes Services\nScaling org clusters There are currently more than 50 orgs hosting digital services in the Altinn 2 platform.\nThey range from Tax Department, Police, the Civil Aviation Authority, and many more. Some have digital services used by millions of citizens every year, while others have digital services used only by 1 person during a year. Some have many digital services while others just 1.\nThis means that the compute requirements for the different cluster vary a lot between the different orgs.\nTo exemplify this we shown the transaction statistics from three different orgs for 2019 in Altinn 2.\nAt the current time, we don\u0026rsquo;t know what kind of CPU usage an average transaction requires.\nIn this example, we assume that 1000 transactions require 1 CPU. (1000 milliCPU)\nThis is probably not correct.\nOrg 1 SKD is the largest org in Altinn 2. Daily transactions vary between 2500 and 365.000.\nThat would mean that SKD would need up to 192 nodes of Standard_D2s_v3\nOrg 2 BRG is one of the larger orgs in Altinn. Daily transactions vary between 300 and 14.000.\nThat would mean that BRG would need up to 8 nodes of Standard_D2s_v3\nOrg 3 HDIR is a medium org in Altinn. Daily transactions vary between 300 and 950.\nThat would mean that HDIR would never need more than 3 nodes of Standard_D2s_v3\nWe have not yet decided how we will be doing scaling of org clusters. We have identified some approaches.\nScaling option 1 The first option is manually scale both pods and nodes.\nThis means that the Altinn Devops team would manually need to increase or decrease the number of nodes based on obeserved/expected usage.\nThe number of pods for a specific application would also be manually set.\nCons Unknown of LoadBalancer is able to distribute traffic correctly Scaling option 2 "

	"content": "Person lookup The person lookup service can be use to verify a national identity number and to retrieve person information about the identified person. The user will need to provide the national identity number and the last name of the person. The service will then verify the input by comparing it with stored data. Both input are required and the last name is used to prevent cleaning of random identity numbers. If the user inputs invalid data too many times the service will block the user for some time.\nThe returned person data can be used to populate additional fields in the model.\nPerson lookup example The service can be used in any of the handlers in the logic namespace. Below we\u0026rsquo;ve created an example using the ProcessDataWrite method in DataProcessingHandler.\npublic async Task\u0026lt;bool\u0026gt; ProcessDataWrite( Instance instance, Guid? dataId, object data) { if (data is MessageV1 message) { Person person = await _personLookup.GetPerson( message.Personnummer, message.Etternavn, CancellationToken.None); message.Fornavn = person.FirstName; return true; } return false; } For this to work we\u0026rsquo;ll need to do a few other changes in DataProcessingHandler.\nAdd a private field for the lookup service and change the constructor to take an instance of the service. Initialize the field in the body of the constructor.\nprivate readonly IPersonLookup _personLookup; public DataProcessingHandler(IPersonLookup personLookup) { _personLookup = personLookup; } The changes to the DataProcessingHandler constructor also force us to update the constructor call from the App class constructor. Add IPersonLookup as an input parameter and use the parameter value as input to the constructor of DataProcessingHandler.\npublic App( ... IText textService, IPersonLookup personLookup, IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor) : base(...) { _logger = logger; _validationHandler = new ValidationHandler(httpContextAccessor); _dataProcessingHandler = new DataProcessingHandler(personLookup); _instantiationHandler = new InstantiationHandler(profileService, registerService); _pdfHandler = new PdfHandler(); } A note on exception handling With no other changes than those above, the app backend will return response code 429 - TooManyRequests if the user has been typing in invalid data too many times. This response code is currently not handled by the frontend react application which results in an \u0026ldquo;unknown error\u0026rdquo;. This can be avoided with exception handling that singles out any PlatformHttpException with a response with status code 429, but there are currently no built in mechanism to convey to the user why a request failed. A workaround for this limitation is to use a property on the data model.\ntry { ... return true; } catch (PlatformHttpException phex) { switch (phex.Response.StatusCode) { case HttpStatusCode.TooManyRequests: // Add corrective messures break; case HttpStatusCode.NotFound: // Add corrective messures break; } throw; } "

See this link for more information.\nMark a field as optional It is possible to mark a field as optional. The default is that required fields are marked as required (with *), while optional fields have no marking.\nDefault behaviour can be overwritten by changing the settings of the field. This is done in the labelSettings property of a component in the form layout.\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-felt-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;labelSettings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;optionalIndicator\u0026#34;: true } } } By setting optionalIndicator to true, the text (Optional) will be shown after the field label.\nNOTE: It is not possible to force the Optional marking on a field that is required. Changing the optionalIndicator property does not alter or overrule the other properties of the field.\nConfiguring automatic save while typing Input components, TextArea components and AddressComponent automatically save changes while the user is typing. By default, this happens 400 milliseconds after the user last stopped typing. At this point validation and triggers will execute as well. In cases where validations and triggers are resource intensive, it might be neccesary to increase the delay before saving automatically - or disable it altogether.\nThis functionality can be controlled using the saveWhileTyping property of a component in the form layout. In the example below, data is saved 2 seconds after the user stopped typing.\n{ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;input-field-1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, ... \u0026#34;saveWhileTyping\u0026#34;: 2000 } } If this property is set to false, typing is the field does not trigger auto-saving or validation at all, and these processes will only run when the user changes focus out of the field.\n"

	"content": "The main goal for how the software is build is that adding new commands, subcommands and options shall be simple. This is solved by implementing a generic command interpreter that does not require changes when new commands,subcommands and options are added.\nThe generic implementation is based on software Interfaces. This requires that new software classes implements the appropriate interfaces so they can be found when matching command line values against commands, subcommands and options.\nThe second important implementation detail is that the commands with definitions is defined in a json file, CommandDefs.json. The file is part of the project as an embedded resource but can be modified and saved at the location defined in the Application setting parameters CommandDefinitionFile.\nThe CLI Application searches for the file at startup, the CommandDefinitionFile is search first.\nApplication settings Setting which is required for the CLI Application is defined in the appsettings.json file. Initial content of this file is:\n{ \u0026#34;APIBaseAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://platform.at21.altinn.cloud/storage/api/v1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AppAPIBaseAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://{org}.apps.at21.altinn.cloud\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;UseLiveClient\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;True\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;StorageOutputFolder\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;c:/storage/Output\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;StorageInputFolder\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;c:/storage/Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;CommandDefinitionFile\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;C:/storage/CommandDefs/Commands.json\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;MaskinportenBaseAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://oidc-ver2.difi.no/idporten-oidc-provider\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AuthBaseAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://platform.at21.altinn.cloud/authentication/api/v1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;tokenSettings\u0026#34;: { } } Setting Description Addresse Defines the base part of API\u0026rsquo; Url. The specific address to be used is selected by dedicated ClinetWrapper which forwards it to the HttpClientWrapper which computes a complete URL. StorageInputFolder Defines folder for storing fetched files StorageOutputFolder Defines folder for where files to send shall be fetched CommandDefinitionFile Defines in which folder the command definition file CommandDefs.json is located. Kommando Definisjon The command definition file, CommandDefs.json defines all commands with subcommands and options which can be \u0026ldquo;executed\u0026rdquo; i the CLI application. The file is initially a resource is the development project. New commands can be added following this format:\n{ \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Login\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SubCommands\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Maskinporten\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Options\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;clientId\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Guid\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;valuerange\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;client guid id\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;apiname\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;clientid\u0026#34; }, ] } ] } First element Name: defines the command name, next Name defines the subcommand name. No other parameters can be defined on this level. Options is an array with following elements:\nElement name Description Name name of the option, the same must be used on the command line, not case sensitive type option datatype. See list below for valid types, type is case sensitive valuerange valid range description description of the parameter to be used in Help apiname name of the option in the API that is accessed, name is case sensitive Valid Data typers Option Type System Type Opsjons klasse bool System.Boolean NumberOption byte System.Byte NumberOption sbyte System.Decimal NumberOption double System.Double NumberOption float System.Single NumberOption int System.Int32 NumberOption uint System.UInt32 NumberOption long System.Int64 NumberOption ulong System.UInt64 NumberOption object System.Object NumberOption short System.Int16 NumberOption ushort System.UInt16 NumberOption string System.String NumberOption datetime System.DateTime NumberOption guid System.Guid NumberOption file System.IO.FileStream FileOption thumbprint System.String ThumbPrintOption Class Overview Program Program is the startup \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; in the CLI Application. It’s main purpose it to implement CLI functionality and register classes that handles commands and subcommands. Register means in this context to scan the application for classes that implements interfaces that shall be searchable in the generic code.\nICommand Must be implemented by all command classes ISubCommandHandler Must be implemented by all subcommand classes IHelp Implemented on all classes that have info to be display by the help command\nThe actual CLI implementation consist in reading the keyboard and forward it to the ApplicationManager\nLogging Logger is injected to the registered command and is configured as a part of the service registration. Logging is default configured to output on console and file for all log levels.\nLog.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .MinimumLevel.Debug() .WriteTo.File(\u0026#34;log.txt\u0026#34;, LogEventLevel.Information) .WriteTo.Console(restrictedToMinimumLevel: LogEventLevel.Information) .CreateLogger(); ApplicationManager The ApplicationManager instantiates command and eventually subcommand from the two first console input parameters. The parameters are used as search criteria’s for finding relevant command/subcommand classes. If a match is found command line input option parameters will be matched and validated against selectable options.\nNot found or illegal value will terminate the command and a proper log message will be displayed in the consol.\nCommand A command class must implement the ICommand interface to be registered in Program. That makes the command available for the generic code which is selecting a command based on the command line input.\nThe selection is based on the implementation of the ICommand interface and the Name property which must match the command name on the command line. The command itself is executed by calling any of the the command class Run methods.\nThere exist two Run commands, one with the SubCommand as parameter and one with a list of command line input parameters that is called if no subcommand is specified.\npublic interface ICommand { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Run the supported command handler /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;param name=\u0026#34;commandHandler\u0026#34;\u0026gt;the command handler to execute\u0026lt;/param\u0026gt; void Run(ISubCommandHandler commandHandler = null); /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Parses the dictionary and run command.

The handling of the option is as described in the ApplicationManager description partly done by generic code. Partly means here creation of correct option type based on the option\u0026rsquo;s type definition property and the activation of validation.\nThe actual validation is implemented in the option class itself. An Option base class is implemented with basic functionality like the TryParse method that is used as a part of the validation of the NumberOption type.\n/// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Interface that defines the propertioes and methods that /// shall be implemented by an Option class /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public interface IOption : IValidate { /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// The Name og the oprtion that must match the Name /// of the otion in the CommandDefinition file /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public string Name { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// The name of the opsjon in ther API. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; public string ApiName { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// The value of the option as a string /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; string Value { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Defines if the option is defined with a vlue in /// the command line /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; bool IsAssigned { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// The description of the option that will be used by help /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; string Description { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Valid range for the paramtere. /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; string Range { get; set; } /// \u0026lt;summary\u0026gt; /// Gets the typed value of the option as defined /// in the option definition /// \u0026lt;/summary\u0026gt; /// \u0026lt;returns\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/returns\u0026gt; object GetValue(); } A set of Option classes is implemented to cover the most used system types. Mapping from the type set in the definition file to a C# class is shown in the table in the subchapter Valid Data Types. The main reasons for implementing dedicated classes is the possibility to implement generic handling of them together with the advantage of implementing separate code in them like validation.\nNumberOption - represent all simple System Data Types FileOption - represent a file, the value of the option shall contain full path to the file. The validation verifies that the file exists. ThumbPrintOption - This option is used as to represent the *thumbprint\u0026quot; value in the ceritificat that is used in Login.\nOptionBuilder Much of the handling of Options is done by the Singleton class OptionBuilder. Main reason for making it as a Singleton is to avoid reading the CommandDefs file for each command. The file is read initially and save in the class member CfgCommands.\nThere are two public methods in the OptionBuilder, BuildAvailableOptions andAssignValueToCliOptions.\nBuildAvailableOptions BuildAvailableOptions finds command/subcommand in the list of available commands defined in the CommandDefs.json and according to defined type instantiates classes with options of correct type.\nAssignValueToCliOptions AssignValueToCliOptions is responsible for validation and assignment of input options. Not valid options/option values are logged, and command is terminated.\nValidation NumberOption\nValidation is done by the generic method TryParse which is call in the Validate method.\nFileOption\nThe FileOption class overrides the Base class defined Validate method. The actual validation consist in a check for the existence of the specified file.\nThumbPrintOption\nThe ThumbPrintOption class overrides the Base class defined Validate method. The actual validation consist is a check for the existence of a certificate in the \u0026ldquo;LocalStore\u0026rdquo; with same thumbprint as the specified thumbprint.\nClientWrapper The construction of the URL is done in dedicated ClientWrapper classes. A dedicated wrapper shall be made for each command. An Interface that defines all public methods in the wrapper shall be made. The interface shall be implemented in a test wrapper that shall be used in unit testing.\nTest Wrapper The test wrapper shall be coded and configures to make verification of command execution possible without connecting to the actual API. The class will mainly be used in unit testing but can also be used to test with real data. That is best done by catching \u0026ldquo;responses\u0026rdquo;, saving the respons and use it in the test that can load the response file(s).\nHttpClientWrapper The HttpClientWrapper make the HHP(s) requests. The wrapper builds the URL based on input parameter. In addition header with required parameters and tokens is build and attached to the requests that is required for authorization on the server side.\nExtensions Command Adding a new command requires following addtions:\nCommand definition on the CommandDefs.json, must include subcommand and options. Command name must be unique. Folder in the development project named with the command name. C# class with name on the command. The class must implement ICommand and IHelp interface Interface which define the methods in the ClientWrapper that will be used by the SubCommandHandler. C# ClientWrapper and a ClientFileWrapper class which implements the ClientWrapper interface. Folder SubCommandHandlers as a subfolder to the new Command folder. C# class for the subcommand which inherits SubCommandHandlerBase and implements ISubCommandHandler and IHelp interface. SubKommando Extend command definition with new subcommand definition in CommandDefs.json, include Option definitions Eventually extend ClientWrapper interface with new method(s) which will be used by the new SubCommandHandler Eventually extend C# ClientWrapper and ClientFileWrapper with new methods defined in the interface C# class for the new subcommand which inherits SubCommandHandlerBase and implements ISubCommandHandler and IHelp interface. Option Extend subcommand with new option definition in CommandDefs.json Eventuelt utvide ClientWrapper Interface med ny(e) method(s) which will be used by the SubCommandoHandle for å få med nye opsjoner Eventually extend ClientWrapper interface with new methode(s) which will be used by the new SubCommandHandler Eventually extend C# ClientWrapper and ClientFileWrapper with new methods defined in the interface Add handling of the new options, if required, to the SubCommandHandler None of the extensions shall require changes in the HttpClientWrapp\u0026rsquo;s. New methods shall be added if changes is required to avoid breaking existing code\n"

Create and maintain Azure container registries to store and manage your private Docker container images and related artifacts.\nIn Altinn 3 each org has their own Azure Container Registry where the images build of their applications are stored.\nIn addition the platform itself has their own container registry\nRead more about Azure Container Registry\nAzure Key Vaults Azure Key Vault is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, or cryptographic keys. Key Vault service supports two types of containers: vaults and managed HSM pools. Vaults support storing software and HSM-backed keys, secrets, and certificates.\nEvery organization cluster has two keyvaults. One is target for secrets for applications. Secrets are added by the app developers as self services.\nThe other is targetet for secrets needed to be shared with Altinn Platform. Access token to storage accounts is one example\n"

Each organisation that is using Altinn Studio will have their own Altinn Apps Kubernetes cluster, isolated from other organisations.\nSee Altinn Apps application architecture or deployment architecture.\nAltinn CLI The command-line interface for the new APIs in Altinn.\nIs used by service owners for retrieving data submitted by users, for instantiating and for updating status.\nhttps://github.com/altinn/altinn-cli/\nAltinn Platform Altinn Platform contains reusable microservices with functionality that can be used by apps. Platform can also be used directly by service owner systems using Altinn CLI and Maskinporten.\nCurrently these microservices are part of Platform: Authorization, Authentication, PDF, Profile, Register, and Storage.\nAltinn Platform is running in its own Kubernetes cluster.\nSee Altinn Platform solution architecture, application architecture and [deployment architecture]\nAltinn environment An Altinn environment is a isolated group of several Altinn solutions functioning together.\nAT - Acceptance testing of Altinn Studio, Altinn Apps, Altinn Platform and SBL. TT02 - App/service test environment used by the app and service owners. Production - The production environment. Altinn Studio Altinn Studio are our tools for app development.\nConsists of Altinn Studio Designer, Altinn Studio Repos and a local code editor / development tool (e.g. Visual Studio Code).\nLets the developers create, edit, test and deploy applications. The apps are deployed as containers to a seperate infrastructure called Altinn Apps.\nhttps://altinn.studio\nAltinn Studio Designer Altinn Studio Designer is a web-based tool for creating, editing and deploying apps.\nIn Designer, it should be easy to create apps by re-using and configuring pre-made components.\nAltinn Studio Repos Altinn Studio Repos is the solution where each app is stored and versioned as a Git repository.\nNo matter which tool is used for development (Designer, Code, or something else), the app is stored in Repos.\nApi Application Programmers Interface.\nApp Short for Application. App is the name that is given for an app. It is used as repository name and as part of AppId and in different metadata. Inside an org the app needs to be a unique name. See also Application.\nDeprecated terms: AppName Service\nAppId A AppId identifies a given application. It is has the following pattern [org]/[app-name]. The app-name is the same as the name of the name of the app repo.\nApplication An applications created in Altinn Studio is called an app, short for application. Apps are deployed to a Altinn Apps environment. The app provides two things:\nan interactive user interface for users wishing to submit data to an organisation, e.g. to fill out a form manually, to read information or to sign an agreement; an api that client applications can interact with. The application also has a metadata representation in the application repository (platform storage), which defines the various element types that an instance of an application can have.\ndeprecated term: Service\nApps Short for Altinn Apps. See Altinn Apps\nApplication Developer A user developing application in Altinn Studio.\nOrg Short for organisation. Organisation is the entity responsible for an app. Typically identified by an unique acronym, e.g. SKD, NAV, OSLK.\nDeprecated terms: Application Owner Service Owner\nData A representation of a data element which is stored in the Altinn Platform.\ndeprecated term: FormElement?\nEvent A record of activites on a specific instance.\nInstance An instance of an application for a specific instance owner is represented as an object. Is created by organisation or instance owner. It contains information of the formdata and attachments stored associated with the instance.\ndeprecated term: ReporteeElement\nInstance Owner The person or entity that is responsible for submitting an instance of an application to an organisation.\ndeprecated term: Reportee\nUser The user which is logged in in Altinn and performs actions for on behalf of an instance owner. A user and an instance owner can be the same entity.\nKubernetes A system for managing docker containers.

See all issues on GitHub related to SBL Bridge.\nStatefull App A statefull app uses Altinn Platform to store data\nStateless App A stateless app is a application where no data is store in in the platform. This could be a app acting like a proxy to some external APIS. State could potensial be stored in the external API, so term statless is limited to how the App not use any state in Altinn Platform.\nProcess The set of tasks a certain app is made of, i.e. data, signing, payment etc. In Altinn Studio we use a *.bpmn file for the process.\ndeprecated term: Workflow\nXACML XACML stands for \u0026ldquo;eXtensible Access Control Markup Language\u0026rdquo;. The standard defines a declarative fine-grained, attribute-based access control policy language,[2] an architecture, and a processing model describing how to evaluate access requests according to the rules defined in policies.\nAltinn Studio Apps uses the XACML standard for defining Policies for apps, the authorization architecture, and the request and response between PEP and PDP.\n"

	"description": "Using texts when designing UI, defining workflow, other settings, deploy, and more.",
	"content": "Text editing and translations Easy and efficient text processing and translation are important in an app development solution. The possibility to reuse texts across multiple apps are especially important.\nTexts in the editor are written in a ini-file that is converted to a simple JSON-file and presented as an API. In that way the user could work directly in the code editor or convert the text into other formats supported by external translation tools. Meaning that Altinn Studio supports any language that is added, not just languages supported by the Altinn portal.\nDefinition of texts using hierarchical and readable keys Reusable texts, internal across different pages and on the levels above the solution Possibility to add other languages Using lanuage keys in the solution Lanuage keys are references in the react-code with the help of a the language method getLanguageFromKey found in src/react-apps/applications/shared/src/utils/lanauge.ts. This method is called in the following way:\ngetLanguageFromKey(\u0026#39;universal_key.lanuage_key\u0026#39;, this.props.language) Where the first param is the language key and the second is the language element. If you call this.props.language.universal_key.lanuage_key you should get the key value\nHow to add a new language Make a new ini-file and place it in AltinnCore \u0026gt; Common \u0026gt; Languages \u0026gt; ini Change the parameter \u0026ldquo;languageCode\u0026rdquo; in the API call to whatever name your ini file is called. Example for Norweigan bokmål (nb): http://altinn3.no/designer/y/types/Language/getLanguageAsJSON?languageCode=nb Guides for language files Keys are sorted by which app they belong to Universal keys ([general]) are placed at the top of the file Keys are sorted alphabetically Keys are written in lowercase with underscores (example_key) Language best practice Summary Name should describe the content of the value. Section should describe the context (might be page, container or component). If your name also describes the page, container or component, you might want to create a new section. Keys (properties) Every key, or property, has a name and a value.\nNames should be short and not context based (context should be in section) Names should not describe presentational functionality like modal or popover. Example:\n[good_example_1] ready_to_deploy_title_false = Text... [bad_example_1] app_is_ready_to_deploy_title_false = Text... [good_example_2] repo_changes_is_invisible = Text... [bad_example_2] changes_made_by_others_in_your_organisation_is_not_visible_in_altinn_studio = Text... Text parts If your text has several parts, suffix with \u0026ldquo;part1\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;part2\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;partN\u0026rdquo;.\nExample:\n[deploy_to_test] error_environment_failure_part1 = Det er noe galt med ditt error_environment_failture_part2 = -miljø. Vennligst kontakt support. Titles, subtitles and bodies If your title has associated text you should use suffixes like: \u0026ldquo;heading/title\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;subheading/subtitle\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;body\u0026rdquo;.\nExample:\n[great_component] welcome_body = Welcome to this great component welcome_heading = Hello world welcome_subheading = Small text below the title Sorting Naming should be used so that related keys/properties are grouped when sorted alphabetically.\nTrue / false If your text has positive or negative text related to logic, suffix with true/false. This will group keys when sorting.\nExample:\n[section] ;Grouping category_repo_read_true = Andre tjenester category_repo_read_false = Du har ikke rettigheter til... ready_to_deploy_title_false = Tjenesten er IKKE klar til å legges ut i testmiljø ready_to_deploy_title_true = Tjenesten er klar til å legges ut i testmiljø [section] ;No grouping category_repo_read = Andre apps category_repo_write = Du har rettigheter til å endre disse appene main_header = Tjenesteoversikt no_category_repo_read = Du har ikke rettigheter til... no_category_repo_write = Du har ikke skriverettigheter til... Errors If there is an error, you should prefix or suffix the key with \u0026ldquo;error\u0026rdquo;. If grouping when alphabetizing is important, use suffix.\nExample:\n[no_grouping] error_a_problem_has_occured = Det har oppstått et problem [grouping] file_uploader_validation_error_delete = Noe gikk galt under slettingen av filen, prøv igjen senere. file_uploader_validation_error_file_ending = er ikke blant de tillatte filtypene. file_uploader_validation_error_file_size = overskrider tillatt filstørrelse. Sections [sections] Sections are used to categorize keys (properties) that belong together. It may be a page, container or component.\nExamples [general] [dashboard] [sync_header] [general] [dashboard] [sync_header] Try to not use application wide sections that might need container or component reference in the key name.\nSee all issues related to text and language on Github.\n"

By default Altinn Studio will use the Altinn theme. The theme will at this point only change colors and fonts in Altinn Studio. The colors are base on the altinn color palette.\nCSS Components are devided into two groups. Shared components that is used several times and should be accessible for several apps.

	"description": "How to add logic to validate form data?",
	"content": "Introduction Validations ensures that the user\u0026rsquo;s input is valid with regard to the data model, in addition to all custom rules that are set up for the application. Validations can be run either on the client- (the browser) or the server-side.\nClient-side validation This is validation that is run in the browser, before data is sent to server for saving. This makes it possible to give quick feedback to the user during the fillout process.\nClient-side validation is based on the data model of the form, and uses this to determine what is valid input in a field. Specifically, the JSON schema version of the data model is used for validation. This is automatically generated when uploading an XSD. It is possible to make changes in the JSON schema file directly to adapt the validation when needed.\nNote that if you make changes in the JSON schema manually, and then update the XSD and reupload it, a new JSON schema will also be generated and all manual adaptations will have to be remade. It is therefore recommended to make changes in the XSD and/or the data modeling tool for these changes to be reflected in the JSON schema.\nAn example of how a field can be defined in the JSON schema data model is:\n\u0026#34;someField\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxLength\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4\u0026#34; } Input in this field will be validated towards the limits that are set, and an error message will appear if these are not met - in this case, if input is a text longer than four characters.\nDefault error messages Default error messages has been set up for all validations done on the client-side. See the overview below.\nRule Error message bokmål Error message nynorsk Error message english min \u0026lsquo;Minste gyldig verdi er {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Minste gyldig verdi er {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Minimum valid value is {0}\u0026rsquo; max \u0026lsquo;Største gyldig verdi er {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Største gyldig verdi er {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Maximum valid value is {0}\u0026rsquo; minLength \u0026lsquo;Bruk {0} eller flere tegn\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Bruk {0} eller flere tegn\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Use {0} or more characters\u0026rsquo; maxLength \u0026lsquo;Bruk {0} eller færre tegn\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Bruk {0} eller færre tegn\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Use {0} or fewer characters\u0026rsquo; length \u0026lsquo;Antall tillatte tegn er {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Antall tillatte tegn er {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Number of characters allowed is {0}\u0026rsquo; pattern \u0026lsquo;Feil format eller verdi\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Feil format eller verdi\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Wrong format or value\u0026rsquo; required \u0026lsquo;Du må fylle ut {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Du må fylle ut {0}\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;You have to fill out {0}\u0026rsquo; enum \u0026lsquo;Kun verdiene {0} er tillatt\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Kun verdiene {0} er tillatt\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Only the values {0} are permitted\u0026rsquo; More about error messages for required fields The error message for required fields is as defined above, \u0026ldquo;You have to fill out {0}\u0026rdquo;. The {0} symbol is replaced with the field that the error message is shown for. This is done in the following way:\nIf shortName text is defined for the component, this is used. This is a new text that is currently used only for this specific error message. If the shortName text is not defined, the title text for the component is used - this is the components label text. In some special cases (Address component) where there are multiple fields within the component, the default labels for the fields is used. Example: Component with only title { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text-firstName\u0026#34; }, ... //etc } With resource texts:\n... { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text-firstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;First name\u0026#34; } The error message would then be \u0026quot;You have to fill out First name\u0026quot;.\nExample: Component with shortName If the field\u0026rsquo;s prompt is long or not suitable for use in the validation message, you can add a shortName text that can be used instead. Note that this only applies to this specific validation message - the shortName text is not used otherwise in the solution as of now.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text-firstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;shortName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firstName-short\u0026#34;, }, ... //etc } With resource texts:\n... { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;text-firstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Please type your first name in the field below:\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;firstName-short\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;your first name\u0026#34; } The error message would then be \u0026quot;You have to fill out your first name\u0026quot;.\nCustom error messages It is possible to define custom error messages that will be displayed when a field doesn\u0026rsquo;t pass the validation check. This is done by including a parameter errorMessage where the field is defined in the JSON schema. The JSON schema file is in the folder App/models and has a naming patterns as follows; *.schema.json,\nAn example of how to extend the example previously presented with a custom error message:\n\u0026#34;someField\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;string\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxLength\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;errorMessage\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myCustomError\u0026#34; } The error text can be included directly. To enable language support, add a text key for a text defined in the resource files.\nNotice that if you have a reference to a definition the error message must be added to the property-field and not the reference/definition. Example:\n{ \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;person\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;$ref\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;#/definitions/personDefinition\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;errorMessage\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;myCustomError\u0026#34;, } }, \u0026#34;definitions\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;personDefinition\u0026#34; : { \u0026#34;age\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;number\u0026#34; }, ... } } Note that when the XSD is changed, the custom error messages will de removed from the JSON schema.\rIn the future, there will be support for setting custom error messages in the data modelling tool in Altinn Studio. But for now, this is a manual job.\rServer-side validation Server-side validation can be split into two categories:\nValidations against data model - These run automatically whenever the user attempts to submit form data. Custom validations - these are written by the application developer, and run when the user attempts to submit form data or move the process to a new step. How to add custom validation Custom validation can also be split into two categories; task-validation and data-validation.\nTask-validation will run each time validation is triggered either manually from the application or when you attempt to move forward in the process. Data-validation will run if you\u0026rsquo;re on a step that has defined data elements associated with it. Validations are written in C#, in the ValidationHandler.cs-file in the application template. The file can be accessed and edited in Altinn Studio through the logic menu, by selecting Rediger valideringer, or directly in the application repo where the file is under the logic/Validation-folder.\nChanges are made in the ValidateData and ValidateTask-methods (these are empty when the app is made). The former takes in a data object and the latter takes in the instance and taskId. To add a validation error, the AddModelError-method of the validationResult-object, which is a parameter in both methods, is used.\nAn example of a simple data validation that tests that the field FirstName does not contain the value 1337, when the root element of the model is Skjema is shown below:\npublic void ValidateData(object data, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (data.GetType() == typeof(Skjema)) { // Cast instance data to model type Skjema model = (Skjema)data; // Get value to test - FirstName string firstName = Skjema?.Person?.FirstName; // Check if FirstName exists, and contains the value \u0026#34;1337\u0026#34; if (firstName != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; firstName.Contains(\u0026#34;1337\u0026#34;)) { // Add validation error, with error message and list // of affected fields (in this case Person.FirstName) validationResults.AddModelError( \u0026#34;Person.FirstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Error: First name cannot contain the value \u0026#39;1337\u0026#39;.\u0026#34; ); } } } See comments in code above for an expnation of what the different parts do.\nIn the other parameter of the method AddModelError, where it says \u0026ldquo;Error: First name cannot contain the value \u0026lsquo;1337\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;, you can use a text key for a text defined in the resource files for multilingual support.\nAn example of a simple task validation that checks how long the user spent on Task_1 and returns an error if there has gone more than three days:\npublic async Task ValidateTask(Instance instance, string taskId, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (taskId.Equals(\u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;)) { DateTime deadline = ((DateTime)instance.Created).AddDays(3); if (DateTime.UtcNow \u0026lt; deadline) { validationResults.AddModelError(\u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, $\u0026#34;Completion of Task_1 has taken too long. Please start over.\u0026#34;); } } } Single field validation If there is a need for immediate validation of a field that can not be covered in the client side validation, you can set up a trigger for validation on single fields in formLayout.json\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;3611fb2a-c06b-4fa7-a400-3f6c1ece64e1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;25795.OppgavegiverNavnPreutfyltdatadef25795.Label\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;simpleBinding\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;etatid\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Input\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;validation\u0026#34;] , // \u0026lt;--- Add this field }, { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;9ec368da-d6a9-4fbd-94d0-b4dfa8891981\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;textResourceBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;title\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Button\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: {}, \u0026#34;textResourceId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Standard.Button.Button\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;customType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Standard\u0026#34; } ] } } Note that if you define a field to trigger validation server-side, only the result of this validation will be displayed. Meaning,\rif there is another client-side validation defined, a possible server-side validation of the field will overwrite these. Therefore, you should make sure\rto implement all necessary validations on the server-side as well. It is possible to attach multiple error messages to the same field if needed.\rThe configuration above will result in your own custom validation in ValidationHandler.cs being triggered each time the field is updated. If you need to know which field triggered the validation, this is available in the http-context as a header of the request named ValidationTriggerField.\nAn example of a custom validation where the header value is retrieved is shown below.\npublic async Task ValidateData(object data, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Request.Headers.TryGetValue(\u0026#34;ValidationTriggerField\u0026#34;, out StringValues value); if (value.Count \u0026gt; 0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; value[0].Equals(\u0026#34;kommune\u0026#34;)) { // Cast instance data to model type flyttemelding model = (flyttemelding)data; // Get value to test - Kommune string kommune = model.kommune; if (!kommune.Equals(\u0026#34;Oslo\u0026#34;)) { validationResults.AddModelError(value[0], \u0026#34;This is not a valid municipality.\u0026#34;); } } await Task.CompletedTask; } NOTE validation of single fields should be implemented in a way where it is both run on triggers and during general validation. The example that revolves multiple complex validations show how this can be implemented.\nSeveral things has been done to get this code to run\nIn ValidationHandler.cs using Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives; is included at the top of the file to be able to use StringValues. In App.cs using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http; is included at the top of the file to be able to use IHttpContextAccessor. In App.cs IHttpContextAccessor is dependency injected in the constructor and passed along to ValidationHandler. public App( IAppResources appResourcesService, ILogger\u0026lt;App\u0026gt; logger, IData dataService, IProcess processService, IPDF pdfService, IProfile profileService, IRegister registerService, IPrefill prefillService, IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor // \u0026lt;--- Add this line ) : base(appResourcesService, logger, dataService, processService, pdfService, prefillService) { _logger = logger; _validationHandler = new ValidationHandler(httpContextAccessor); // \u0026lt;--- Include the new property here _calculationHandler = new CalculationHandler(); _instantiationHandler = new InstantiationHandler(profileService, registerService); } If there are multiple complex validations that are time consuming, it is recommended to implement several private methods to validate these and use ValidationTriggerField to determine which private method is to be run. You can e.g. use a switch statement to accomplish this.\npublic async Task ValidateData(object data, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (data is flyttemelding model) { _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Request.Headers .TryGetValue(\u0026#34;ValidationTriggerField\u0026#34;, out StringValues value); string dataField = value.Any() ? value[0] : string.Empty; switch (dataField) { case \u0026#34;kommune\u0026#34;: ValidateKommune(model, validationResults); break; case \u0026#34;boaddresse\u0026#34;: ValidateBoAdresse(model, validationResults); break; default: ValidateKommune(model, validationResults); ValidateBoAdresse(model, validationResults); break; } } } private void ValidateKommune(flyttemelding model, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (model.kommune != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !model.kommune.Equals(\u0026#34;Oslo\u0026#34;)) { validationResults.AddModelError( nameof(model.kommune), \u0026#34;This is not a valid municipality.\u0026#34;); } } private void ValidateBoAdresse(flyttemelding model, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (model.boaddresse != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; model.boaddresse.Length \u0026gt; 150) { validationResults.AddModelError( nameof(model.boaddresse), \u0026#34;Address can not be longer than 150 characters.\u0026#34;); } } Specify that validation errors are fixed When validation is triggered by a single field, all former validations on this field will be removed pending a response from the last validation. If a field triggers validation that updates/adds an error message to multiple fields at once, these will not be removed even when there no longer are any errors in these fields. This is because there is no way to know which fields may have been validated through a single field validation.\nFor example, if you have two fields; first name and last name. Both fields trigger single field validation, and if both fields have a value, you can validate that the full name can not be longer than 50 characters. An error message is then set on both fields. If you correct this by changing the first name, the error message from first name will disappear, but the error message on the last name field will still be displayed even though the validation does not set any error messages on the fields.\nprivate void ValidateFullName(Datamodell model, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (!string.isNullOrEmpty(model.fornavn) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !string.isNullOrEmpty(model.etternavn) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; model.fornavn.Length + model.etternavn.Length \u0026gt; 50) { validationResults.addModelError(nameof(model.fornavn), \u0026#34;Full name can not be longer than 50 characters.\u0026#34;); validationResults.addModelError(nameof(model.etternavn), \u0026#34;Full name can not be longer than 50 characters.\u0026#34;); } } To be able to remove old error messages in a case like this, there has been added support to be able to specify that a validation error has been fixed. Then, the field in question will be able to be notified that a specific error message that it is displaying has been fixed and can now be hidden.\nThis is done by adding a validation error in the code in the case where there are no errors in the validation, and set *FIXED* in front of the error message itself. This corresponds to the setup for soft validation. This prefix causes the error message that is set to be removed from the field in question, or ignored (if there is no error message on the field already).\nYou can now expand the example above to support this:\nprivate void ValidateFullName(Datamodell model, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (!string.isNullOrEmpty(model.fornavn) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; !string.isNullOrEmpty(model.etternavn) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; model.fornavn.Length + model.etternavn.Length \u0026gt; 50) { validationResults.addModelError(nameof(model.fornavn), \u0026#34;Full name can not be longer than 50 characters.\u0026#34;); validationResults.addModelError(nameof(model.etternavn), \u0026#34;Full name can not be longer than 50 characters.\u0026#34;); } else { validationResults.addModelError(nameof(model.fornavn), \u0026#34;*FIXED*Full name can not be longer than 50 characters.\u0026#34;); validationResults.addModelError(nameof(model.etternavn), \u0026#34;*FIXED*Full name can not be longer than 50 characters.\u0026#34;); } } Soft validations Soft validations are validation messages that does not stop the user from submitting or move onto the next step of the process, but that are used to give the user different forms of information. These types of validations can for example be used to ask the user to verify input that seems wrong or strange, but which strictly speaking is not invalid, or give useful information for further filling out the form.\nMessages based on soft validation will be displayed once, but the user can choose to move on without making any changes.\nSoft validations are added from the server-side the application logic, in the same way as regular validation errors. The difference is that the validation message must be prefixed with the type of validation you want to give, e.g. *WARNING*. This will be interpreted as a soft validation. The prefix *WARNING* will not be displayed for the user.\nThe different types of soft validations are WARNING, INFO and SUCCESS.\nCode example\npublic async Task ValidateData(object data, ModelStateDictionary modelState) { if (data is TestModel testModel) { string firstName = testModel?.Person?.FirstName; if (firstName != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; firstName.Contains(\u0026#34;1337\u0026#34;)) { validationResults.AddModelError( \u0026#34;Person.FirstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;*WARNING*Are you sure your first name contains 1337?\u0026#34;); } if (firstName != null \u0026amp;\u0026amp; firstname.Contains(\u0026#34;Altinn\u0026#34;)) { validationResults.AddModelError( \u0026#34;Person.FirstName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;*SUCCESS*Altinn is a great name!\u0026#34;); } } await Task.CompletedTask; } Examples on display of different validations below:\nIt is also possible to overrule the title you see on the messages by adding the keys soft_validation.info_title, soft_validation.warning_title, and soft_validation.success_title in the text resources if you want to set a custom title.\nGroup validation It is possible to apply validations to a repeating group when the user saves a row in the group. This can be done by adding a trigger on the group component in the layout file (e.g. FormLayout.json). Example:\n{ \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;layout\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;demo-gruppe\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Group\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;...\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 3, \u0026#34;dataModelBindings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;group\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Endringsmelding-grp-9786.OversiktOverEndringene-grp-9788\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;triggers\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;validation\u0026#34;] // \u0026lt;--- Add this }, ... ] } } This will ensure that validation is run on the components that are a part of the group on the index you\u0026rsquo;re working on. If there are validation errors you will be stopped from saving the group until this has been corrected.\nIf you add validation on the group component, a call will be made towards the validation back-end with a header specifying which component triggered the validation: ComponentId. Validations are written in C# in the ValidationHandler.cs-file in the application template. In the validation, you can then retrieve this id and tailor possible validations that should run back-end, example:\npublic async Task ValidateData(object data, ModelStateDictionary validationResults) { if (data is flyttemelding model)) { _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Request.Headers .TryGetValue(\u0026#34;ComponentId\u0026#34;, out StringValues value); string component = value.Any() ? value[0] : string.Empty; switch (component) { case \u0026#34;demo-group\u0026#34;: // run validations specific to the group break; default: // run the validations in their entirety break; } } } For tips on how you solve complex validations, see the examples under single field validation.\n"

Issue #8347.\n3.36.4 (2022-05-10) - Fix in validation of required field in hidden groups (again) After the last fix, released in version 3.35.2, the problem would persist if the fields were hidden individually instead of hiding the entire group. This additional vector has now been fixed. Issue #6398.\n3.36.3 (2022-05-10) - Only reference description if the field exists Fixes a bug where components had defined aria-describedby to a element that did not exist. Issue #23.\n3.36.2 (2022-05-06) - Fixed a potential crash after failing validation from server Fixes a recently introduced bug where some failing validations passed from the server could crash the app instance. Issue #8481.\nPatching of external dependencies for week 18 of 2022.\n3.36.1 (2022-05-06) - Fix in validation of required fields in repeating multi-page groups Fixes a bug where required fields inside multi-page repeating groups were being marked with errors even when no instances of the repeating group had been added. Issue #7478.\n3.36.0 (2022-05-03) - Added support for dynamics in nested repeating groups. Added support for dynamics in nested repeating groups. Issue #55.\n3.35.2 (2022-05-02) - Fix in validation of required field in hidden groups Fixes a bug where hiding a non-repeating group with required fields could display a message asking the user to fill the invisible required fields. Issue #6398.\n3.35.1 (2022-04-28) - Dependency patching Patching of external dependencies for week 17 of 2022.\n3.35.0 (2022-04-28) - Marking required fields Changed default behaviour of marking optional fields to now mark required fields with * as default. Optional fields have no marking as default behaviour, but this can be configured using the labelSettings property of the field, see here.\n3.34.4 (2022-04-28) - Removed out-of-place heading in receipt when there are no attachments When PDF generation has been disabled and there are no attachments, the heading indicating there should follow a list of attachments has also been hidden. Issue #8296.\n3.34.3 (2022-04-28) - Bugfixes for caching of lasted visited view Fixes a bug where stateless app would use a shared key for persisting the last visited view. Also fixes an issue where an empty page would be displayed if the persisted layout id was no longer present. Issues #7897 and #6975.\n3.34.2 (2022-04-25) - Fixed colors in radio and checkbox The colors for radio and checkbox borders were not adhering to accessibility requirements from WCAG 2.1.

	"tags": [],
	"description": "Overview of changes introduced in v1.0.62-alpha -- 2.0.1",
	"content": "2.0.0 (2020-11-18) - Autodelete on process end For some apps, the fact that there\u0026rsquo;s traces of it in the user archive (and the data is stored) is a problem (e.g. for security reasons). The Altinn.App.* packages has been updated to support autodelete when process ends. This is introduced with version 2.0.0-alpha of the packages.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.3.1 (2020-11-06) New layout structure in Designer In order to support multiple pages in an app we have done some restructuring of the app-template. When you are doing changes in Altinn Designer for your app the updated FormLayout.json will be put under the new structure. For apps that have nuget references to Altinn.App.Api, Altinn.App.Common, and Altinn.App.PlatformServices with versions below version 1.2.0 this will make the app unable to find the FormLayout.json on the network call against the app.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.1.11-alpha (2020-10-02) - Registration of events The Altinn.App.* packages has been updated to work with the new Events component in Altinn. This is introduced with version 1.1.11-alpha of the packages.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.1.0-alpha (2020-10-01) - Deleting instances from endpoint in app #4871 was fixed with in release of 1.1.10-alpha of the app nugets. This change only affects users and app owners that try to delete an instance.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.1.8-alpha (2020-09-23) - Update path of Data Protection Keys for Apps #4483 changed the way we use data protection keys in order to improve the support for running locally. These keys are used in XSRF-protection. When you are running apps locally, we are using the default behaviour (directory under current user) for .Net Core. The path is passed with an environment variable when running in an apps cluster. This change requires the deployment.yaml file to be updated with the correct variable.\nThe change affects all application created in Altinn Studio before 30.09.2020 using Altinn.App.PlatformServices 1.1.8-alpha and above Updating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.1.2-alpha (2020-07-15) - Namespace renamed A namespace was renamed in Altinn.App.PlatformServices Version=\u0026ldquo;1.1.2-alpha causing the build of the application to fail if references to this namespace isn\u0026rsquo;t changed. This affects all applications created before June 2020 that reference nuget versions \u0026gt;= 1.1.2-alpha.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.1.0-alpha (2020-07-01) - Multiple changes Property type changed for UserProfile.ProfileSettingPreference Introduced with issue: #4466 and release v2020.28.\nThe change affects all applications in TT02 and PR with nuget version 1.0.98 and lower.\nNew endpoint for application text resources Introduced with issue: #4451 and nuget 1.1.0.-alpha.\nThe change affects all application created in Altinn Studio before 8.07.2020 using nuget versions 1.1.0-alpha\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entries in breaking changes here and here\n1.0.86-alpha (2020-05-29) - Platform authorization for Register and Profile Introduced with issue: #4162 and Release: v2020.23.\nThe change affects all application created in Altinn Studio before 03.06.2020.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.0.82-alpha (2020-05-15) - Updated client-side validation Introduced with issue: #3944, and applies to existing apps that upgrade to the new major version of app frontend (v2).\nThe client-side validation of the app frontend has been replaced with a JSON-schema validation in order to provide a more complete client-side validation. As of v2 of app frontend, client-side validation has support for type-checking basic types, including enums. When upgrading the frontend version to v2, the app must use nuget versions 1.0.82-alpha or newer.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n1.0.80-alpha Removed GET operations with body Introduced with issue: #3738.\nThe Register API had a few GET operations that took an input parameter through the body of an http request. Requests against these operations would work in AT environments, but would be broken by API Management in production like environments. The operations in question has now been removed and replaced with operations that require POST requests.\nErrors The methods that have been removed were used by an app when an instantiation were done by the Application owner. More specifically if the instanceOwnerPartyId were unknown. The instantiation request would then have the Person number or organization number instead, and the Register operation would be used to identify the correct party id.\nPOST https://{org}.apps.tt02.altinn.no/{app-id}/instances/ { \u0026#34;appId\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;org/app\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;instanceOwner\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;personNumber\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;12247918309\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;organisationNumber\u0026#34;: null, \u0026#34;instanceOwnerPartyId\u0026#34;: null }, ... } How to fix Any issues related to this change can be fixed by upgrading to the latest version of Altinn.App.PlatformServices. This means the App must be updated and a the new version deployed to all environments. Existing instances are not affected.\n1.0.78-alpha Send-in / Validation fails with \u0026lsquo;Ukjent feil\u0026rsquo; Introduced with issue: #3927.\nThere was a vulnerability in the solution allowing to update a whole instance object using an endpoint in app backend or storage. This has been solved by refactoring app backend and removing the endpoints.\nAny issues related to validation failing with \u0026lsquo;Ukjent feil\u0026rsquo; for apps with nuget packages older than 1.0.78-alpha can be solved by upgrading to 1.0.78-alpha or newer.\n1.0.62-alpha (2020-03-13) Data and task validation Introduced with issue: #3820.\nThe base class that every application inherits has been altered to allow for both data and task validation.\nUpdating to this version will require changes in multiple files. See the entry in breaking changes\n"

	"description": "Overview of changes introduced in version 3.",
	"content": "3.5.1 (2021-03-11) - Possible to get ruleconfiguration for apps with layout sets There was a bug resulting in av 404 response whenever it is attepmpted to retrieve the ruleconfiguration for an application while specifying the layout set id in the request. This has now been fixed.\n3.5.0 (2021-03-10) - Added funcionality for pdf generation for application owner Up until now a pdf copy has not been generated for the tasks that are completed by the application owner. This has now been implemented and pdf should be generated after a task regardless if it is an end user of the app owner that completes the task.\n3.4.0 (2021-03-10) - Endpoint and functionality for get page order made available All apps now expose an endpoint for getting the current page order based on the current state of an instance. Default behavior is to return the page order as defined in Settings.json to override, add the function below in Logic/App.cs and include your own logic.\npublic override async Task\u0026lt;LayoutSettings\u0026gt; FormatPdf(LayoutSettings layoutSettings, object data) { return await _pdfHandler.FormatPdf(layoutSettings, data); } 3.3.0 (2021-03-04) - Retrieving certificate from Key Vault now uses name The ISecret service now requires certificate name as input for retrieving a certificate from key vault. Previously this has been the certificate id, but this identificator contains more information that an app developer might have available, so the service has been simplified.\n3.2.3 (2021-02-17) - Fixed duplicate key exception on options When using the same option key in an option result a duplicate key exception was thrown that crashed the app. This is now fixed, and keys that already exist in the option result will not be added.\n3.2.1 (2021-02-10) - Correctly set unread status when instantiated by end user The instance now appears as read in the messagebox if it is instantiated by an end user through api, regardless if they have opened the instance in GUI or downloaded the form data they just posted.\n3.2.0 (2021-02-02) - Options displayed with label in PDF Before this release the selected option was shown with it\u0026rsquo;s value rather than the label that the end user was presented with during form filling. This has now been fixed so the label is diplayed in the pdf.\n3.1.6 (2021-01-29) 3.1.5 (2021-01-27) 3.1.4 (2021-01-26) 3.0.4 (2021-01-26) - Swagger support for Apps We have added Swashbuckle to the App. It is a library that brings Swagger support and this is especially handy when developing an HTTP based API. It creates a form of interactive documentation based on the OpenAPI Specification. To describe the Api\u0026rsquo;s better, we use the xml documentation file.\nThis documentation will be generated automatically when the application is build. Existing api\u0026rsquo;s and new api\u0026rsquo;s created in the app will be documented.\nThe documentation will appear at https://[org].apps.altinn.no/[org]/[app]/swagger/index.html in the app.\nTo enable this, there\u0026rsquo;s some changes.\nUpdated package dependencies, generate xml documentation file and copy xml documentation for Altinn.App.Api Navigate to you application repository and find App.csproj in the App folder.\nUpdate nuget dependencies in App.csproj to version 3.0.4, add new property for Altinn.App.Api.\n\u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Api\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;3.0.4\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;CopyToOutputDirectory\u0026gt;lib\\$(TargetFramework)\\*.xml \u0026lt;/CopyToOutputDirectory\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/PackageReference\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.Common\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;3.0.4\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Altinn.App.PlatformServices\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;3.0.4\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; This is new in App.csproj\n\u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Swashbuckle.AspNetCore\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;5.6.3\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PropertyGroup\u0026gt; \u0026lt;GenerateDocumentationFile\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;/GenerateDocumentationFile\u0026gt; \u0026lt;NoWarn\u0026gt;$(NoWarn);1591\u0026lt;/NoWarn\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/PropertyGroup\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Target Name=\u0026#34;CopyXMLFromPackagesForBuild\u0026#34; AfterTargets=\u0026#34;Build\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ItemGroup\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PackageReferenceFiles Condition=\u0026#34;%(PackageReference.CopyToOutputDirectory) != \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#34; Include=\u0026#34;$(NugetPackageRoot)$([MSBuild]::Escape(\u0026#39;%(PackageReference.Identity)\u0026#39;).ToLower())/%(PackageReference.Version)/%(PackageReference.CopyToOutputDirectory)\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ItemGroup\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Copy SourceFiles=\u0026#34;@(PackageReferenceFiles)\u0026#34; DestinationFolder=\u0026#34;$(OutDir)\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Target\u0026gt; Changes to the Startup.cs file.

	"content": "4.34.1 (06.04.2022) - Support for specifying shipment type for eFormidling shipment This release makes it possible to specify the shipment type for an eFormidling shipment.\nExtend the eFormidling section i applicationmetadata.json with the new property dpfShipmentType as shown below.\n\u0026#34;eFormidling\u0026#34;: { ... \u0026#34;dpfShipmentType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;altinn3.skjema\u0026#34; } 4.33.0 (15.03.2022) - Support for turning off PDF generation This release makes it possible to turn of PDF generation for a given form\nThis is defined in ApplicationMetaData for the given DataType. Default is true\nExample\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;melding\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;allowedContentTypes\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;application/xml\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;appLogic\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;autoCreate\u0026#34;: false, \u0026#34;ClassRef\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;App.IntegrationTestsRef.Data.apps.dibk.nabovarsel.Melding\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;enablePdfCreation\u0026#34; : false } 4.32.0 (14.03.2022) - Person lookup service client The platform application Register has been given a new endpoint that can be used to verify correct national identity number. This version of the app template packages have a new person lookup client that can be used to perform lookups with the new endpoint in Register.\n4.31.1 (10.03.2022) - Fixed bug related to prefill and enriched instance events with person identification number This release fixes a bug where prefilling the same value to more than one field throws a duplicate key exception. This has been solved by flipping the prefill dictionary. Person identification number has been included to the platformUser data of an instance event. 4.30.0 (07.03.2022) - Support for readiness og liveness probes An endpoint dedicated for health check has been implemented. This is used by Kubernetes to know when an instance of the application is ready for load.\nAll applications created before 16.06.2022 must be manually updated to enable the readiness and liveness probes.\nIn App/Startup.cs\nAdd the line using Altinn.App.Core.Health; amongst the using-statements at the top of the file\nIn the function ConfigureServices, add the line\nservices.AddHealthChecks().AddCheck\u0026lt;HealthCheck\u0026gt;(\u0026#34;default_health_check\u0026#34;); In the function Configure add the line\napp.UseHealthChecks(\u0026#34;/health\u0026#34;); In deployment/Chart.yaml the reference to the Altinn Helm Chart should be updated to version 2.1.0\nThe final result should resemble this:\napiVersion: v1 description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes name: deployment version: 1.1.0 dependencies: - name: deployment repository: https://charts.altinn.studio/ version: 2.1.0 In deployment/values.yaml under deployment, add\nreadiness: enabled: true liveness: enabled: true NOTE identation is imporant in yaml files. readiness og liveness must be on the level below deployment, and at the same level av volumeMounts og volumes.\n4.27.0 (23.02.2022) - Secure options endpoint Add support for secure options endpoints Fixed url and parameter separator logic in GetInstanceEvents Change redirect url from string to base64 encoded string\n4.26.0 (2022-02-10) - Improvements to text resource in relation to PDF Use new appName text resource as PDF title. Use local texts for pdf generation instead of text resources from Platform Storage.\n4.25.0 (2022-01-24) - Dynamic application settings for front end Added a new section called FrontEndSettings for use in appsetting.{environment}.json files. This is made available for front end as applicationSettings and is a dynamic list of values. It\u0026rsquo;s possible to add new entries to FrontEndSettings without the usual need to make code changes in backend. The feature ensures that backend can provide environment specific values to the front end application.\n4.24.0 (2020-01-21) Support language and query parameters in dynamic options. New way of implementing dynamic options by creating a class that implements IAppOptionsProvider. See doc\n4.23.0 (2022-01-15) - Updated backend support for BPMN gateways Restructure of process engine and support for BPMN gateways\n4.22.0 (2022-01-07) - Included access token generation for eFormidling integration point The integration point used for sending instance data through eFormidling now required a valid access token. Apps now fulfill all requirements of the integration point.\n4.21.0 (2021-12-01) - Added support for saving username for instance owner If a self indentified user instansiates an instance, their username is saved in the instance owner metadata.\nAdded Api in App to expose XACML Policy and BPMN Process\n4.20.0 (2021-11-18) - Added support for custom redirect URL when exiting an app The URL to an app can now contain a query parameter (returnUrl) which, if validated (valid URI and host name), can be used to redirect the user to that URL when the user clicks on the exit icon in an Altinn 3 app. Read more about it here\nRelated to 7183\n4.19.0 (2021-11-15) - Added support for instantiation based of a copy of an archived instance The app template now supports the instantiation of an app based on a copy of an archived instance. The new endpoint is documented here. Note that support for copying an app in the message box and configuration of the application through Altinn Studio is still under development.\nRelated to 6695\n4.18.0 (2021-11-10) - Added support for OIDC configuration You can now configure a specific OIDC provider in app.\nRelated to 7173\n4.17.2 (2021-10-27) - Added API for instansiation with key-value prefil It is now possible to instantiate with keyValue prefill through a new instantiation API.\nYou can also use prefill in custom code. This will require that the app implements the latest version of App.cs which includes the following method\npublic override async Task RunDataCreation(Instance instance, object data, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { await _instantiationHandler.DataCreation(instance, data, prefill); } And the latest InstansiationHandler.cs with the method signature\npublic async Task DataCreation(Instance instance, object data, Dictionary\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt; prefill) { await Task.CompletedTask; } 4.16.0 (2021-10-07) - Added API for tagging of data elements It\u0026rsquo;s now possible to save tags on a data element. To support this there are 3 new API endpoints for listing existing tags, adding a tag, and to remove a tag from a data element.\nThis change is associated with issue 6861 on github.\nThere is more information about the new API under the app API documentation.\n4.15.2 (2021-10-04) - New endpoint for retrieving active instances Altinn Apps now expose a new endpoint for retriveing active instances for a given instance owner. The new endpoint can be reached at {org}.apps.altinn.no/{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/active.\nThe change is related to issue 6767.\n4.14.1 (2021-09-22) - 500 error when retrieving non existing instance fixed There was a bug causing a 500 response when an request is made towards Get/Instances for a non-existing instance. This has now been fixed and the response returned is 403. Swagger for the endpoint is updated to reflect possible response codes.\n4.14.0 (2021-09-13) - Partial support for namespace XML The code that deserializes XML has been updated to support namespace declaration in the root element.\nExample:\n\u0026lt;Skjema xmlns=\u0026#34;urn:no:altinn:skjema:v1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Navn\u0026gt;Altinn\u0026lt;/Navn\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Skjema\u0026gt; Deserialization occurs when an external system uses the app API to submit a new form, when they overwrite an existing form, and when an app retrieves a form from blob storage.\nThe change is not automatically used by all apps that update to this version. For the change to take properly effect the C# class that represents the model must be updated. The class needs to be decorated with an XmlRootAttribute with the Namespace property set to the correct namespace.\nExample:\n[XmlRoot(ElementName = \u0026#34;Skjema\u0026#34;, Namespace = \u0026#34;urn:no:altinn:skjema:v1\u0026#34;)] public class Skjema { [MaxLength(100)] [XmlElement(\u0026#34;Navn\u0026#34;)] public string Navn { get; set; } } This change must be done manually for all old and new models. The model editor in altinn.studio has not be updated to do this automatically.\n4.13.0 (2021-09-03) - Event for changed substatus on instance Changing the substatus of an instance triggers an event app.instance.substatus.changed which can be subscribed to in the event component.\nThis solves issue #6691\n4.12.0 (2021-08-27) - Identity data is included in the request telemetry for all requests In Application Insights we now register the properties listed below enabling linking of an entity to a specific request received by the application.\npartyId authentication level userId organisationNumber This solves issue #5983\n4.11.1 (2021-08-26) - No longer possible to cache response from stateless apps Caching of the stateless data responses is no longer possible.\nThis solves issue #6532\n4.11.0 (2021-08-03) - Support for disabling reportee selection in Altinn Portal Apps now support adding query parameter DontChooseReportee=true to disable the reportee selection when an unauthorized user accesses an app. The result being that the user will represent themselves and be routed directly to the application after login.\nThis release solves issue #6573.\n4.10.2 (2021-07-15) - Text resources are loaded locally The app will now load texts from the locally stored text resource files (config/texts/*) instead of retrieving them from Storage. Texts are still uploaded to Storage during deploy. The change is to remove unnecessary calls to Storage and to avoid an issue with caching that prevented new texts from being used immediately. #6466, #6415 Fixed a bug where a filename with space in it could lead to a crash. #6421 New apps created after the v2021.29 release will provide security headers like X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, and Referer-Policy. To activate this in existing apps follow these steps: Open the App/Startup.cs file. At the top of the file add the namespace reference: using Altinn.App.Api.Middleware; Find the Configure method and add the statement: app.UseDefaultSecurityHeaders(); Add it right before existing app.Use* statements. E.g. before app.UseRouting(); 4.9.2 (2021-07-08) - Fixed messages from multipart request validation Validation messages from multipart request validation was misleading. This release solved issue #6418.\n4.9.1 (2021-07-02) - Bugfix for errors in multipart validation Fixed a bug that caused validation messages to show C# type of DataType rather than DataTypeId. Issue #6418\n4.9.0 (2021-06-29) - Support for marking a single field validation error as fixed It is now possible to mark a previous validation error as fixed by using the prefix *FIXED* in front of the original error. Documentation on how to implement the functionality.\n4.8.0 (2021-06-22) - Application version number available in AppSettings During app deployment an environment variable with the app version number/name is added to the app runtime environment. This version information can now be retrieved in any controller or service through the AppSettings configuration object. Just add a dependency on AppSettings into the class and access the new property called AppVersion.\n4.7.1 (2021-06-15) - Adjustments to response headers Some of the controllers exposed by the applications have been modified to not allow caching and/or storage of their responces in the client.\n4.7.0 (2021-06-08) Altinn Apps now authorize access for statless apps.\nAltinn Apps now have two new application events where application developers can add data processing logic. calculation, population, and more.\nIn this update the RunCalculate application event is made obsolete/deprecated. It\u0026rsquo;s recommended that Apps are updated to use RunProcessDataWrite and RunProcessDataRead instead. Calls to the RunCalculate method will be removed in a future update.\nThe process to update is\nAdd the DataProcessing folder and DataProcessingHandler class from our app template to your app. Update App.cs. Add a class field for DataProcessingHandler and copy new methods ( RunProcessDataRead and RunProcessDataWrite) from App.cs Move logic from calculation handler to DataProcessinghandler Remove RunCalculation method from App.cs Remove CalculationHandler when code has been moved to DataProcessingHandler. Compile and test your app. See details about data processing here\n4.6.2 (2021-06-01) - Duplicate keys in options causing crash This release has a fix for a crash related to PDF rendering when an app have options with duplicate entries. #5887\n4.6.1. (2021-05-21) Changed alternative subject Altinn Apps now uses org instead of organization as subject when publishing events.\n4.6.0 (2021-05-11) - Apps now support data fields Altinn Apps now support data fields. Data fields allows for adding data values, from either form fields or a custom source, to the instance object. Form data can be added by configuring data fields in applicationmetadata.json while custom sources require coding. Documentation on how to add data values to an instance can be found here.\n4.5.2 (2021-05-04) - Endpoints for stateless data elements exposed through app. Bug stopping local testing fixed Altinn Apps now expose endpoints for creating, prefilling and running calculations on stateless data elements. A stateless data element entails there is no link to an instance or instance owner, and the data is simply presented to the end user, but not persisted in any database.\nIn addition, a bug breaking apps running with localtest intoduced in 4.4.1 has been fixed.\nInformation on the new endpoints can be found in the swagger exposed by each application https://{org}.apps.altinn.no/{org}{app}/swagger\n4.4.1 (2021-04-30) - Ask user to upgrade security level An app would show the \u0026ldquo;unknown error\u0026rdquo; message if a user were trying to access an instance with a security level that was too low for the instance. This has been fixed. The user is now sent to authentication with the option to pick an authentication method that provides a higher security level. The fix targets the GET instance endpoint specifically.\n4.4.0(2021-04-27) - Performance fix Improved performance.\n4.3.0 (2021-04-28) - Apps now support presentation fields Altinn Apps now support presentation fields. By specifying presentation fields in applicationmetadata.json, speficied data values from the form data will be stored on the instance in order to show them along with the app title in the Altinn messagebox. Further documentation on how to configure presentation fields is found here.\nThis change is related to this epic.\n4.2.0 (2021-04-19) - Possible to integrate an app with eFormidling Altinn Apps now support integration with eFormidling. Documentation on how to set up an application to use eFormidling will be published once an integration point for eFormidling is set up in Altinn Platform.\n4.1.0 (2021-04-07) - Add new property with updated data to response for PUT to DataController During PUT of data to DataController ({org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId:int}/{instanceGuid:guid}/data), any calculations that are defined by the apps are run, and data is potentially updated before being saved. Previously, the response returned only the metadata for the updated data element, and a GET to fetch the updated data was necessary. In this version, a dictionary of all the fields that have updated data from calculations is returned as a new parameter in the API response (in addition to the data element metadata), so that clients do not need to perform the additional GET request in order to get the updated data.\nThis change is related to this issue.\n4.0.3 (2021-03-23) - Fixed a bug reading filename from Content-Disposition The specification for Content-Disposition specify that filename should be in quotes. This was not supported by the app backend API, causing requests following the specification to fail. This has been fixed. Added support for filename* (FilenameStar). If Content-Disposition contain both filename and filename*, the value defined by filename* will be used. 4.0.1 (2021-03-15) - Upgraded application to .Net 5 and grouped references of Altinn App and Altinn Platform services in Startup.cs Altinn.App.* librarires target .Net 5 now, which requires that the application does the same. In addition we have created two methods for referencing all app and platform sevices in Startup.cs\nSee breaking changes for how to update you app to be compatible with this version.\n"

	"content": "5.3.0 (21.06.2022) - Support for autodeleting data elements This release introduces support for autodeleting dataelements when the process ends. This is to restrict end user\u0026rsquo;s access to data elements after the process has been completed.\nTo configure auto deletion include \u0026quot;autodeleteOnProcessEnd\u0026quot;:true in the appLogic section of the dataType in applicationmetadata.json. A fully configured data element should look like this\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;VedleggB\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;taskId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Task_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;maxSize\u0026#34;: 25, \u0026#34;maxCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;minCount\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;appLogic\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;autoDeleteOnProcessEnd\u0026#34;: true } } 5.2.0 (07.06.2022) - Api for supported languages Features This release introduces new api endpoints which gives information about the languages supported in the application. Ref. upcoming feature for selecting language 5.1.0 (23.05.2022) - Support for anonymous stateless apps Features This release makes it possible for users to access a statelss apps without being logged in. This is particularly useful for guides where users answer various questions in order to be guided to the correct solution but you as a service owner don\u0026rsquo;t need a stored instance as the result of the process the users went through.\nThe ability to use Altinn 2 options from an Altinn 3 apps. This is useful for migration scenarios and where a corresponding Altinn 3 options are not available.\nBugfixes A fix for tracks not working with stateless apps. A fix where a null pointer exception was thrown in /{org}/{app}/instances/{instanceOwnerPartyId}/active when the instance was initialized from api. A fix allowing any content type when content type is unspecified. "

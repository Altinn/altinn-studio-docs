# Contributing to docs.altinn.studio

The site is generated from [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) 
using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/) static site generator.
We use YAML as front matter.

## Initial setup

1. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and clone the [altinn-studio-docs repository](https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio-docs) to a local folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Altinn/altinn-studio-docs
```
2. We recommend downloading and using [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with
   - [this markdown extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) for editing markdown and
   - [the github extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) for helping with pull requests
4. [Download the latest Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) (extended) for your platform, and place the executable in the altinn-studio-docs folder.

## Build / Edit / Test locally

1. Open the altinn-studio-docs repo-folder in visual studio code
2. Run `hugo server --navigateToChanged`. Now baksia is running locally at http://loalhost:1313/
3. Edit and save files in the `content`-folder to automatically get a new local build of the site refreshed in your browser, so you can test your changes locally.

## Push your changes to GitHub
We recommend that you create a pull request when you want to share your changes with the rest of the world.

1. [Create a branch](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_branches-and-tags) for your changes
2. [Create a pull request](https://youtu.be/LdSwWxVzUpo)

## Deploy
Whenever changes from your pull request are merged into the main-branch, an automatic deploy is updating https://docs.altinn.studio/

PS: If you don't have direct write access to the repo, you need to [create a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) from your fork.

## Internal Code Review Guidelines

General Principles:
•	Avoid terms that might be interpreted as personal attacks (e.g., "idiotic" or "useless"). Assume that everyone is making their best effort.
•	Be moderate in your language. Avoid strong exaggerations like "always," "never," etc.
•	We're all on the same team. The intention is not to criticize but to produce better code.
•	Smaller, frequent pull requests are easier to manage than larger ones. Aim to limit the scope of code to approximately 200 lines for each review.

Guidelines for Reviewers:
1.	Focus on the Code, Not the Person: The goal is to elevate the quality of the code, not to showcase your expertise. Be constructive in your feedback.
2.	Adhere to Established Standards: Stick to coding conventions and practices that are accepted within the team. Deviations must be justified.
3.	Understand the Purpose: Make sure to understand the rationale behind the code you're reviewing. Go through any associated documentation or task definitions.
4.	Clarify Importance: Distinguish between critical issues and lesser suggestions. Make it clear what needs to be amended before the code can be merged.
5.	Invite Discussion: Ask questions like, "Have you considered isolating this logic into a separate method?" rather than giving direct instructions.

Guidelines for Authors:
1.	Self-Check: Review your own code to catch simple errors before requesting a review.
2.	Details in Pull Requests: Include an explanatory text that provides reviewers with necessary context.
3.	Respond to Reviews: Provide feedback on all comments. A simple "Done" or "Agreed" is often sufficient.
4.	Be Receptive: Be open to critique and suggestions. Argue your case if needed but be willing to consider alternatives.

Procedural Rules:
1.	Speed is a Virtue: The review should be quick to avoid potential conflicts during merging.
2.	More Eyes, Better Outcome: Aim to have at least two reviewers for substantial code changes.
